Geology is the scientific study of the Earth's origin, structure, and processes. It dates back to ancient times when people began to observe and understand the natural world around them. However, the field of geology as we know it today began to develop during the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries.

In the 17th century, Dutch cartographer and geologist Abraham Ortelius published his seminal work, ""Theatrum Orbis Terrarum,"" which detailed the geographic and geological features of the Earth. In the 18th century, the Scottish engineer James Watt used geology to explain the stability of mountaineous regions and the causes of river erosion.

During the 19th century, geology became a more organized and sophisticated field of study. With the development of new technologies like the telegraph, photography, and seismographs, scientists began to explore the Earth's interior and the phenomena that occur within it. The discovery of the geological and temporal sequence of rock layers, known as the geologic timescale, revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's history.

In the 20th century, the field of geology saw significant advances in the study of mineralogy, petrology, and geochemistry. The discovery of Earth's mineralogy made it possible to better understand the composition of the Earth's crust and the materials that make up our planet. Advances in petrology and geochemistry led to the development of new methods of analyzing rocks and other geological materials, allowing for more accurate assessments of the Earth's history.

Today, geology is a diverse field that encompasses a wide range of topics, from the study of ancient earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to the exploration of mineral deposits and the search for oil and gas. Geologists continue to make groundbreaking discoveries about the Earth's history, and their work has profound implications for our understanding of the natural world and our place in it.

This is fascinating! Could you expand on the technological advancements that have helped geologists understand the Earth's interior and geological history?
Certainly! Over the years, several technological advancements have helped geologists study the Earth's interior and geological history.

One of the major technological advancements is the use of seismography. Seismographs measure the vibrations created by earthquakes, allowing geologists to determine the depth and movement of tectonic plates. Seismometers are also used to measure seismic waves created by other geological phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions or landslides. By analyzing these waves,",499,4,2623

Provide a mathematical formula that takes into account the distance and time to compute the average speed of a vehicle traveling on a highway. Additionally, discuss the factors that affect travel speed, such as traffic congestion, weather conditions, and road surface quality. Finally, compare and contrast travel speed with average speed and explain the differences between them. 
Table: 
| Input | Output |

    speed = distance / time
    return speed
Here's an explanation of the concept of travel speed in the context of highways:
Travel speed refers to the speed at which a vehicle travels on a highway. It is an important factor to consider when planning a trip, as it can affect the time it takes to reach the destination and the overall comfort of the journey.
The mathematical formula to calculate the average speed of a vehicle traveling on a highway is:
Average Speed = Distance / Time
For example, if a vehicle travels a distance of 100 km in a time of 2 hours, its average speed would be:
Average Speed = 100 km / 2 h = 50 km/h
Factors that can affect travel speed on a highway include traffic congestion, weather conditions, and road surface quality. During peak traffic hours, for instance, the speed of the vehicle may be reduced due to the high number of cars on the road. Similarly, adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain or snow can also affect the travel speed of a vehicle. Road surface quality can also play a role, as a poorly maintained road may result in increased friction and reduced speed.
Travel speed, on the other hand, refers to the speed at which a vehicle actually travels from one place to another, including stops at traffic signals and other obstacles that may slow down the journey. Average speed, on the other hand, refers to the speed at which a vehicle would travel if it were able to maintain a constant speed throughout the journey, excluding any stops or obstacles.
In summary, travel speed is an important factor to consider when planning a trip on a highway, as it can affect the time it takes to reach the destination and the overall comfort of the journey. Factors that can affect travel speed include traffic congestion, weather conditions, and road surface quality. Travel speed and average speed are related but different concepts, with travel speed being the actual speed of the vehicle while traveling",512,4,2546

The first step in understanding the relationship of technology and law is understanding the most important thing about technology -- that it is always changing. Computers and their capabilities are changing and evolving every day. Hardware, software and even the Web are changing, and changing faster and more often than any other industry in history. So one of the first and most important lessons to learn from the new world of technology law is: Don't assume you know enough to make a good decision. You can't assume you know about programming, and you can't assume you know about law.
But if you don't know enough to make a decision, what should you do? Look for informed, objective help in assessing the risks and rewards of technology -- through attorneys and other specialists -- and, if that isn't available, educate yourself the best you can.

Hi Guys,

Although i have been using the above post, physics engine finally after further research suggested. It still requires some thinking. When we think about the numerical performance of physics engines, Heat dissipation is not really considered. We generally calculate the heat dissipation for modeling heat equation for thermodynamics in MATLAB or any other language. Then we have to add the dissipation coefficient which is generally an A constant added to F and F represents the force on the fluid, E is an energy model. Is there any way we can follow the same guideline while using physiX engine. I mean in physiX when we create a collision between a particle, and a plane and we get the object as a component of it. Then, do we have the disspation coefficient assigned to it? If not, do we need to add the disspation coefficient manually on this interaction or create this collision with the main ""bodies"" in the system. These are the kind of questions i came across when using physiX engine. Any help is highly appreciated to start up with physics engine in a numerical perspective. Still i am not sure of the way i am asking this question but let the physics engine show us the way to make the most out of it and not throw around the parameters before diving it.

21,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Physics is the study of the fundamental principles that govern the physical world around us. It is a branch of science that seeks to explain the behavior of matter, energy, and their interactions. The study of physics involves the use of mathematical models and scientific laws to understand the behavior of objects and phenomena in the natural world.

At its most basic level, physics can be divided into two main branches: classical physics and modern physics.

Classical physics is the study of phenomena that occurred before the development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century. This includes topics such as mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and optics. Classical physics is still used today in many applications, such as in engineering and construction.

Modern physics, on the other hand, is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It includes quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. These fields involve the study of phenomena that cannot be explained by classical physics, and often require the use of complex mathematical models and advanced laboratory equipment.

Overall, physics is a very broad and diverse field, and encompasses a wide range of applications and areas of study. It is an essential tool for understanding the world around us, and is used in a variety of fields including engineering, technology, medicine, and even in fields such as finance and economics.

Can I understand electricity better by learning physics? Yes, learning physics can help you better understand electricity. Physics is the study of the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, including electricity. By learning physics, you will gain a deeper understanding of the principles and laws that govern electrical circuits, such as Ohm's law and the behavior of electrical current.

Physics provides a mathematical framework for understanding the properties and behavior of electricity, such as the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. By studying physics, you will also learn about the principles of electrical engineering, such as circuit analysis, which is the study of how to analyze and design electrical circuits.

The history of business school education dates back to the late 19th century when the need for business professionals became increasingly apparent. Prior to this time, business education was largely informal and unregulated.

In the late 19th century, universities began to establish business schools as separate entities. These institutions focused on teaching practical skills necessary for business success, including accounting, finance, marketing, and management. Harvard Business School, founded in 1908, is often cited as the first true business school in the world.

During the early years of business education, most schools were focused on teaching students how to run large, established corporations. However, by the mid-20th century, the focus began to shift towards entrepreneurship and small business ownership. This shift reflected the growing popularity of entrepreneurship and the changing nature of the business world.

In the 1960s and 1970s, business education continued to evolve and expand. Schools began to offer more specialized courses, such as finance, marketing, and human resources, and began incorporating more theoretical concepts and research into their programs.

In the 1980s and 1990s, business schools began to emphasize the importance of technology and information systems in business operations. Schools began offering courses in computer science, business analytics, and other related fields.

Today, business school education has continued to evolve. With the rise of online education and globalization, schools are increasingly offering more flexible and accessible programs. Many schools also offer executive education programs, which are designed to provide executives with the skills and knowledge necessary to lead organizations effectively.

33,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are indeed based around principles of probabilities, which is why quantum mechanics is often described as ‘wave-particle duality’. In fact, this duality and the associated quantum uncertainties can be summarised by the famous Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment, described below.
Schrödinger, the most famous quantum physicist, wrote a thought experiment that imagines a cat in a sealed box, with a few non-lethal chemical devices on the interior. A radioactive sample would decay after time and release a substance that would break a vial of poison, but only if a counterdetecting beam is broken. In that case, a hammer would fly through the vial, break the vial, and release the poison, causing the cat to die.
The experiment assumes that the radioactive sample has an uncertainty in its decay time, so that we can never predict with absolute certainty that the sample would indeed decay. The experiment can’t tell us if the particle would actually decay or not, it can only give us some idea that it might decay at some point. Even if we know that there’s a chance that it will decay, we can’t know if it does or does not, and the cat could be both alive or dead, it could be alive but not dead, dead but not alive, or simply cannot be known due to uncertainty. The point is that these sorts of uncertainty can appear in quantum measurements in certain ways.
Schrodinger’s cat is sometimes used to illustrate the point that you can’t know if an event will happen or not, but it doesn’t work by itself. You wouldn’t ask a horse if it’s alive or not when it’s fully inside a box (despite, it may be, actually doing neither). This is because it’s an assumption that there is such a thing as a scientific phenomenon that can have uncertainty on its outcome. If we see as a certainty that it will rain we don’t ask a question as to whether or not it will, just as we do not ask a cat in a box if it is alive or dead.
Quantum mechanics were, and are still, being developed in light of this uncertainty, but the whole point is to reconcile the definition of the observer with the definition of the observed.
Uncertainties can be used to illustrate phenomena that are defined by probabilities, which is why quantum mechanics is often described as wave-particle duality.
The Uncertainty Principle (Gleason’s Theorem) is a consequence of these wave-particle duality principles and proved using these uncertainties",527,4,2408

Once upon a time, a group of scientists embarked on an experiment to discover the secrets of the human brain. They had always been fascinated by the complex structures and functions of this amazing organ, and they were determined to unlock its potential for human progress.

The team was led by Dr. Sarah Lee, a brilliant neuroscientist with a reputation for being a renegade thinker. She had assembled a diverse group of researchers from all over the world, each with their own unique expertise and approach to the project.

The first step in their experiment was to create a unique brain model that would allow them to study the inner workings of the human brain in detail. They used advanced technology to map out the neural pathways and connections between neurons, creating a detailed model that was accurate down to the smallest details.

But this was just the beginning. The team knew that to truly understand the brain, they needed to find new and innovative ways to interact with it. So they turned to virtual reality technology, creating a virtual reality environment that allowed them to manipulate the brain in real-time.

Dr. Lee was particularly interested in the idea of using virtual reality to simulate different emotions and experiences, in order to study how they affected the brain and its responses. She believed that by understanding the emotional responses of the brain, they could develop new treatments for mental illnesses and other disorders.

But the team faced a major challenge when they tried to apply their knowledge to real patients. They discovered that there were limits to what they could achieve with virtual reality technology alone. They needed to find a way to bridge the gap between the virtual and the real, and to create a new technology that could connect the brain to the outside world in a way that was both safe and effective.

With the help of her colleagues, Dr. Lee spent countless hours developing a new type of neural interface that would allow her team to connect directly with the brain. It was a risky experiment, and there were many obstacles to overcome along the way.

But finally, after years of hard work and perseverance, the team succeeded in creating a groundbreaking neural interface that was both safe and effective. They were able to connect directly with patients' brains, allowing them to observe and manipulate neural pathways and responses in real-time.

As a result of their work, the team made groundbreaking discoveries about the brain that revolutionized the field of neuroscience. They were able to create new treatments for mental illnesses, develop new technologies for neuroprosthetics, and unlock the full potential of the human brain.

37,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," cannot be overstated. Neuroscience is the study of the brain and nervous system, and its impacts on various aspects of human behavior, cognition, emotion, perception, and learning. With significant advances in technology, neuroscience has become an integral part of scientific research, medicine, and education. Neuroscience has a wide range of applications, from treating neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's to developing new drugs and therapies for mental health issues.

One of the most important contributions of neuroscience is its role in the treatment of neurological disorders. With the understanding of brain function and structure, researchers can develop more effective treatments for conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. These treatments often involve medication and physical therapy to manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Additionally, new technologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are being developed to help individuals with paralysis or other mobility issues regain some control over their bodies.

Another key application of neuroscience is in education. Researchers have discovered that certain types of brain stimulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, can enhance cognitive abilities and improve learning outcomes. Additionally, neuroscience can help identify the factors that contribute to poor learning outcomes, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and develop strategies to address these issues.

Furthermore, neuroscience is a critical component of many fields, including psychology, education, healthcare, and sports. For example, sports researchers use neuroscience techniques to understand how athletes' brains respond to different training stimuli and to develop more effective training programs. Psychology researchers use neuroscience to understand how the brain processes information and to develop new therapies for mental health disorders. Neuroscientists also contribute to advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence, which have far-reaching applications in fields such as engineering, healthcare, and military.

Neuroscience has contributed significantly to the development of new drugs and therapies for mental health issues. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Additionally, neurologists can use brain imaging techniques, such as functional MRI (fMRI), to identify areas of the brain that are active during different tasks and to develop targeted treatments for various conditions.

In conclusion, neuroscience has a wide range of applications in modern society. The study of the brain and nervous system has provided significant advances in the treatment of neurological disorders, education, and fields such as sports, psychology, healthcare, and robotics. With continued advancements in technology and research, neuroscience will likely continue to be a critical component of modern society.

These technologies have allowed researchers to view animals and their habits in so many new ways, but unfortunately it’s the tools they use to gather this data that in many instances are a source of concern to conservationists and researchers. Excessive camera trapping for example, is now a huge industry and an increasingly controversial one at that.
Camera traps are very popular tools, mainly because they can quickly gather vast amounts of data with minimal impact on the environment. They can literally be left in place for months, even years, and only need occasional maintenance. They work by capturing photographs and video whenever an animal passes within their range of view. They can be set up to operate almost completely on their own and, if the images or videos are stored internally in the camera, can potentially record an entire sequence of images before deletion. Using a host of different triggers, from infrared, to motion sensors and even motion lures, these cameras are an ideal tool when simply acquiring data.
But of course this reliance on technology is not without its problems and these days with even the most basic cameras retailing for £100-£150, they can now be easily used and left in the field for long periods of time. Not only that, but with the huge strides made in capturing technology, they can now be purchased with high resolution lenses of up to 16 megapixels. The bigger the camera the better the photos are, right? Well, yes and no again.
The amount of wildlife taking the time to pose for photographs is getting rarer and rarer. Images of even highly charismatic species are now becoming a commodity, and the very act of taking the picture in the first place means the animal has to expend some of its energy getting away from its normal life to pose for one.
This technology can and does have very positive outcomes in wildlife conservation and research, but there are certainly more balance needs to be found between data collection and understanding of the animals, and the need to maintain their normal behaviour.
There are still many areas of wildlife research that have a long way to go in their data gathering methods and process, but we definitely need to learn to strike a better balance between them and nature.

This work is concerned with the direct numerical simulation of single-phase flows relevant to the processing of silicon and lead glass and for the fabrication of solar PV. We present an example of direct numerical simulation (DNS) of laminar flow in rectangular ducts, at supersonic Mach number and large Reynolds number. This fluid phase, n=p, possesses a compressible structure and is therefore non-ideal for use in regular modelling frameworks, such as those based upon the Navier-Stokes equations. High-performance computers are required to run DNSs, in real time, at these quantities.

Quantum flows everywhere – around us.

Let’s go back to a basic example. Suppose you want to measure a particle in $\mathbb{C}$. You have to take a complex value and, to do that, you have to perform an observation. Consider for a moment a classical particle. What is a particle? It is a point. If you throw a ball in the air and release it in a given position, the ball will have a particular position. However, the ball doesn’t have an attribute called “height”. The same reasoning applies to a quantum particle. In a quantum world there are no positions, there are quantum flows. Every quantum particle has three dimensionless attributes: $\mathbf{w}$, $\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{\omega}$ (or better a couple of attributes: $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{d}$). They are “moments” of the particle’s quantized orbital (there is an analogy between a quantized orbital and a classical ideal gas). One would say that the absence of motion is possible, and so is the presence of three modalities of motion.

What’s the moment of a motion? Now, let’s say that two three-part cards with non-singular features are in motion and the points belonging to the “motion cards” do not intersect. Two points are in motion. What happens when three points are in motion? The same thing will happen. If you think about three distinct points, you will realize that if the two points are in motion the third point is forced to follow the same direction as the two points and this one is in turn forced by the third point to follow the same direction of the first two. Then we have a cycle of motion:

$+$ $+$ $+$ (cycle 1) + $+$ $+$ (cycle 2) +

.

You will probably notice that a cycle is nothing else than a point. You know that in a point there is no length. You will probably also realize that for the point to exist it’s necessary for other points to be in motion. A single point in the position is not really a point. However, if another point is in motion, then a point becomes a point. Let’s study this by introducing $\mathbb{C}$.

The philosophers of mathematics of ancient Greece developed a view of the field that came to be called formalism. This view says that mathematics is a game, played with two kinds of ""linguistic props""—the symbols of logic (indicated by variables, letters, and words) and the rules of logic (of which negation and implication are examples).
In their language (or games) the players assert and assume (negate) sentences called propositions. These propositions are either true or false. We can imagine that some players wish to know which propositions are true and which are false, but the formalists state that it is meaningless to inquire into the truth or falsity of a proposition. Consequently, players are free to ""move"" the rules of their language, moving a meaningless proposition from one place to another. This process is called ""modifying,"" ""altering,"" or ""changing"" the language.",213,4,1041

Problem: Without using a calculator, find the sum of all the Prime numbers below 1000

Solution:
By a bit of Pythagoras and intuition with simplifying on the calculator as you go along

The sum of all the numbers below 1000 = 1+2+3+4+5+...1000
1+1000 = 1001
2+999 = 1001
3+998 = 1001
4+997 = 1001
5+996 = 1001
...
500+500 = 1001

1001 is not a prime so we can carry on

1001+1000 = 2001
1002+999 = 2001
1003+998 = 2001
...
1999+2 = 2001

And all combinations of even numbers up to 1998 also all add to the same sum

1998+1 = 1999
1997+2 = 1999
1996+3 = 1999
...
198 = 1999

We now have 4 groups of 1998 primes
2001+1999 = 4000
2002+1998 = 4000
2003+1997 = 4000
...
2000+2 = 2002

We now need to break the last group of 4 down further...

2002+1 = 2003

1001 is a prime so we can carry on
2003+2 = 2005
2004+3 = 2007
2005+4 = 2009
2006+5 = 2011
2007+6 = 2013

...And we're done!

2012+2 = 2014

Biased Sampling In Graphical Models For Anomaly Detection
Hovik Bechoian

Machine learning methods have been extensively explored within the field of anomaly detection over the past several years. Typically, these methods are based on a generative approach, which requires reconstruction of original data to learn its distribution. However, generating the training data can be challenging, especially if the phenomenon under study is unknown or the scale of datasets is very large. Furthermore, the costs of generating such data often become prohibitively expensive. In this context, we turn our focus to data which is not produced by the phenomenon of interest, but available in their raw form. For instance, internet traffic that is used for example to build risk maps for online merchants. We demonstrate how to learn graphs in the presence of graph-level anomalies while avoiding reconstruction of the training graph to learn its underlying generative model. We provide theoretical and experimental results on graph data obtained from different sources, such as online social networks, web and email traffic, and electrical circuits.

1. Introduction

Anomaly detection has been an area of active research for more than two decades. One of the main motivations of anomaly detection is to identify the events or processes that are significantly different from the usual ones [16], or from their normal patterns [31]. This is of particular importance in large-scale environments where it is possible for a single process to affect multiple other processes within an organization. Indeed, there are two main categories of anomalies: individual and collective. In the former category, a single process (e.g., user) deviates from its normal behavior. In the latter category, one or several processes collectively or even independently lead to a deviation from the normal process they participate in. A widely used paradigm for such cases, referred to as both automatic outlier detection and anomaly detection, is to learn the generation process of the normal behavior (i.e., the generative model) and compare the real data to the model. This is a common method to identify the abnormalities in the data. Naturally, several challenges arise when learning the generative model [43",491,4,2489
49,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and other difficult words in their latest research. One drawback is that they can prove too difficult for readers of academic publications. More knowledgeable readers will understand the specific knowledge presented in the article, but less knowledgeable ones will be confused by the wide range of technical jargon found in academic publications. Therefore, to make technical writing accessible to everyone is one of the most challenging tasks.
This question is addressed by Pausch and Tett (1999), who published their discussion paper to present the problems around the specialized language in scientific publications. They define the acronyms required to ensure accessibility. However, Pausch & Tett were writing in 1999. New and new acronyms are also being developed in research. Technicality is increasing with the increasing difficulty of terminology in science and technology. Is it possible to really comprehensively cover every acronyms used in the specific field? It is impossible, otherwise written text would reach millions of pages and it will be impossible for a reader to read and find information in scientific and academic publications. Even if technical writing in science is difficult to read, it can be helpful to use available tools, such as domain name lookup and meaning services and cheat sheets that offer acronyms of specific topic areas. This article describes some of the useful tools and resources for technical text writing.
Acronym lookup
Acronymfinder.com is one of the most useful tools for the automatic lookup of technical terms. This tool allows researchers to find answers to their searches in a matter of seconds. Each result also shows the entire explanation of the acronym as well as the company where it is used, which will help to make the search even more straightforward. Even if acronymfinder.com does not have an accurate result, it is worth using it as a starting point in your search and by using other search engines. FreeAcronyms.com is another online tool for acronym search. Users can search technical acronyms, abbreviations and definitions. Its results are displayed in an alphabetically ordered list of definitions that only provide a minimal overview of the explanations of each term.
Language process tools
Language tools help you simplify the process of creating text. This software is not specifically designed to simplify technical text writing. However, their role is to support and facilitate the process of using technical language. English grammar checkers that automatically check for grammar and spelling errors are often able to perform this task. However, it is essential to have at least some information about how to interpret technical text, because grammar checkers only check for grammatical errors",506,4,2771

From influential reports that are trying to explain what a grand unified quantum theory may be like (see my book Making Sense of Quantum Mechanics, arXiv.org, December 2012, free download), to talks about the necessary “ansatz” to quantum mechanics (e.g. Lee Smolin, January 2013, quantum gravity’s fatal flaw, Physics World, January 2013), to the explorations by leading quantum people about non-QM, such as David Bohm‘s “pilot wave” theory (Arthur C. Clarke, “Pilot Wave and Quantum Theory”, April 2013, Phys.Lett.B615:297-301, 2005), or the “superposed shapes” proposed by Mandelstam and Feynman (Peyton of the Purdue University, September 2014) to depict some of the weird features of quantum mechanics, to the lively conversations we have at the “Speculations about the Future of Quantum Mechanics” conference in Munich, Germany, June 27th 2014: all these developments point to the kind of fruitfulness which is the sign of a healthy science. Let’s hope that soon we will know for sure why nature chose quantum mechanics to govern the microcosm.
Sometimes, there are topics for which theoretical physicists have nothing to say yet, and mathematical physicists often shun them. One of those topics is the problem of supersymmetry. On May 26th 2014, a workshop was held at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, to discuss developments which were encouraged by the observation that even pure quantum mechanics may yield something like supersymmetry: superposition properties of quantum mechanics.
The precise statement is: Suppose two quantum states are prepared, and represented by pure states in a Hilbert space. Suppose we construct the product state $\vert\psi\otimes\phi\rangle$ by applying a tensor product on the two basis states, and then measuring them independently: they should come out as the same state, to have a good chance to do that. Now, they may be linearly independent, as you can see by analyzing the inequalities, but if not, then it happens that at least one is a superposition, i.e. a superposition of the other one, and of some orthogonal linear combination: it is therefore connected to the latter state.
One can try to calculate the structure",489,4,2198

For example, a painting of an ancient forest where the trees have been transmuted into stone or a rock or a brachiopod. The artist poses a subtext or interpretative narrative. This allows the artist to express the latest theories and sentiments of their time. This includes, pre-Cambrian, Carboniferous, Mesozoic, Tertiary and Quaternary environment and causes.

That the universe must have been made with its present face for some end, in view; the surface of the earth, being the seat of life, must be specially fitted for the maintenance of terrestrial animals and plants. Whether the end was to make an exhibition of scientific speculations, or to improve them by the result of experience, or both, and finally to establish man on a step which would place him next to God, it is not for us to speculate about; but in any case, he has been made with his current face to view, and the fact is not likely ever to be counteracted.

53,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,": As an actor, theater is important for me on two very specific fronts: 1) The bigger the audience, the more rewarding it is to do great theater. I have had the good fortune of being involved with stories in an Off Broadway setting (where 200 seats to a play is big) and I have been involved with ""big"" Hollywood settings (1400 seats is big) and the latter have been more rewarding. There is a connection between audience and actor that is different in theater than in film. 2) Off Broadway theaters in my view, are best in what's called ""old school"" theaters. Their importance, importance to culture, and importance to the actor far outweigh what theaters are (or aren't) today.
I spend a lot of time rehearsing for productions, and am pretty intimately involved in how a production is put together. Not just on stage, but in the rehearsal process and then even after the show begins. I've seen productions in space that I would never ever do because it is too much work to realize.

A “GUT”: I believe what is called the “Grand Unified Theory” will arise from the current concept of unified supersymmetric GUTs, i.e. GUTs with “supersymmetry”. While this will generate a quantum superfield like the W and Z force bosons in a theory of the four forces in nature it will also build into it our particle and fundamental “unitary symmetry” as discussed in the University of Antwerp. This will also lead, one hopes to a SUGRA theory based on a quantum superfield being built out of superstrings as the “other part” of the SUGRA theory. However, all this is in the distant future, however there is today a close connection between formal mathematics (quantum gravity) and physics (380,000 metres per second, Hubble constant as a transverse oscillation with fringe effect, tests of quantum theory), I am hopeful that with the opportunity to sit with university mathematics professors and speak a common language we can work toward the basis of the unified theory of supersymmetry and supersymmetric GUTs, and understanding the universe as the fact of fundamental particles being localized inside the equivalence classes of the unification of the unitary symmetries as probability distributions for the particles of matter and forces of nature, i.e. quantization. I would like to work with you toward the future of science as the most central art in our time, to see us recognize, the lost energy that was swept under the rug in all our society in the 1900’s: the Art of Basic Science.
I have a dream, a great dream to see the concepts of a universe of fundamental particles to find the “string theory” within the context of supersymmetry and extended supersymmetry, and that the unitary symmetries of the constant mass, time and space in Minkowski space in quantum mechanics have one and the same explanation: the Euclidean homotopical algebra in quantum mechanics. We must recognize then the conceptual symmetry between scalar 1-forms and two-forms with grade 0, 1 and 2 and higher spaces of these different gauge field superfields. In particular, since the discovery of the Poincaré forces we must view the new spherical invariance between form and vector fields as the fundamental symmetry between gauge field and matter fields.

I believe that any reference of a practical application of QM is only strictly correct within the confines of the experimental setup used, that application for the research by this group didn't investigate the wider applicability, e.g. as a result of applying this group's experimental setup on another group's QM solutions could very well result in different interpretations.

There are many practical applications of QM for example, radiations scientists use Quantum Mechanics for the construction of nuclear energy generation systems and detectors.

Aside from that, engineering for nanotechnology would be incomplete without Quantum Mechanics. Everyone use the laws of physics to design, but the way they apply the laws is based on Quantum Mechanics. This is done in almost every generation of technology. For example, microchips are designed based on the quantum mechanics of semiconductors. How a certain location works and what happens inside it depends on QM.

56,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," cannot be overstated. Over the past few decades, oceanography has played a critical role in several areas of society, including marine science, naval defense, ocean exploration, climate change research, and much more. Oceanographers use advanced technologies such as autonomous underwater vehicles, advanced sensors, and advanced imaging systems to explore the depths of the ocean and gain insights into this critical component of our planet. 

One of the main areas in which oceanography has made a significant impact is in the field of marine science. Oceanographers use their expertise to study the marine environment, including the life that inhabits it, the geological features of the ocean floor, and the impact of human activities on the ocean. This research has led to new discoveries and advancements in our understanding of marine ecosystems, marine life, and the ways in which we can protect these valuable resources.

In terms of naval defense, oceanography has played an important role in developing underwater weapons systems and submarines. In fact, many of the current submarine design and construction techniques are based on the insights gained from oceanographic research. Oceanographers also use their expertise to study ocean currents, tides, and waves, providing valuable information for naval operations and maintaining navigation channels.

Oceanography has also been instrumental in the field of ocean exploration. The development of advanced technologies such as autonomous underwater vehicles and deep-sea drilling rigs has enabled oceanographers to explore areas of the ocean that were previously inaccessible. This research has led to new discoveries and a greater understanding of the geological and biological features of the ocean floor.

Finally, oceanography has been instrumental in helping us understand the impact of climate change on our planet. Oceanographers have used their expertise to study the warming of the oceans and its effects on marine life and the global climate. This research has helped us understand the impact of human activities on the ocean and has led to new policies and actions to mitigate the effects of climate change.

Overall, the importance of oceanography in modern society cannot be overstated. From marine science to naval defense to ocean exploration and climate change research, oceanographers are helping us better understand this critical component of our planet and develop solutions to the challenges we face.",439,4,2484

*This is a critique of where feature engineering and other quality issues are done, not meant as a critique of what c is really about in an attempt to compare machine learning algorithms.
The honest answer is that there really isn't any relationship between formula (2) and the definition of non linearity in physics - this formula is only a tool that works when describing a correlation between two variables by a function that includes both independent variables.
With the concepts of concept creation, feature engineering, concept definition and theory, I see these issues as debatable and not totally clear for that reason, and a lot of the work is hard, kind of nerve breaking sometimes.
In my opinion, it feels like it's not worth it for machine learning, and the development and communication of machine learning really haven't improved as much as they should have since the 1990s. When I look at data scientist there are far more impressive and far more productive scientists in academia than that the PhD students at the machine learning department.
This and that how to do feature engineering (and everything else) all falls within my ""pretty picture of concepts in science"" rather than the definitions in the mainstream theory of science, and the goal here is also to preserve and establish these definitions in order to have science meet its goals.
Essentially in the physics literature this example would be used as a toy example to illustrate a notion that a term containing the two constants C_1 & C_2 called 1 in this situation should really be contained in what is called F(I,J), so not in a function of the form F(X,Y) where X and Y is more abstract, as it's like multiplying two constants times two dimensional matrices - We have two dimensionals all over and one dimension for both integrals, that could be merged to be one dimension for both integrals. Or in a generative context the constants could be seen as generated from the scales in real world data.

# The challenges of travel

As in many other fields of activity, the travel industry is constantly evolving and increasingly expanding. The travel experiences of travelers are becoming more and more desirable and complex. One of the tasks faced by the tourism industry is, therefore, to guarantee reliable services to the users in the best conditions.

From the hotels, going through the buses and trains to the low-cost flight, transportation companies are called upon to provide an efficient service, able to ensure the satisfaction of the travelers. They must also be able to provide better conditions for the customers, in addition to the necessary quality. Here is a summary of the main challenges of travel.

But, of course, these challenges are not just about the mobility sector. The business sector that constitutes tourism in general must overcome all the obstacles in order to survive.

## The challenges of travel

People from different countries and from different regions of the world come in contact with one another through the means of travel, who, in many cases, share the same language. Internationalization and expansion go hand in hand. People get used to traveling, which is a very common element in the life of all civilizations.

But, of course, challenges do arise in these circumstances. Concerns and fears are a normal part of human evolution. Our ancestors would have cared about wild beasts, at the time man would have been afraid of wild beasts. And over time the fears have not disappeared.

Today, in the 21st century, we still fear that the most unpredictable event could happen: we have planned our entire life, set our schedule and everything is perfect until suddenly, when the plan must be carried out, the crisis happens. We believe that this is the moment in which it is necessary to show that people are not made of steel and iron, capable of everything.

When faced with such extreme difficulties, we face our deepest fears. The media in general has contributed to this in an important way.

To the point that what once belonged to a limited geographic area can now be accessible to anyone. The fear of not being able to escape from a place, the problem of transport, communication failure, social distances … you can find problems in all kinds of locations.

There are 54 million children enrolled in primary school, 17 million children not attending school and 7 million out-of-school children being excluded from school because of their gender, ethnicity or disability
Even though primary school enrolment in sub-Saharan Africa is on the rise, almost half of the region’s children are still not enrolled in school. In fact, there are already 17 million children without access to education and a further 69 million primary school-aged children who do not reach the level of education required to access secondary school. Moreover, the proportion of out-of-school girls is over 10 times higher than the corresponding figure for boys in the sub-Saharan African region.
The particular nature of the educational challenges in Africa can be seen in the demographic structure of the continent, which is characterized by a high rate of population growth - it is the only region in the world projected to grow in number and also in age. One of the main causes of high and growing population rates is high fertility rates, which continue to exceed 4.5 children per woman in the majority of countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
A clear sign that education has yet to attain its intended universal primary school enrolment target is the substantial variation in school enrolment rates between countries. In 2010 the education attainment (the proportion of the population that has attained a given level of education) was:
40 per cent in Nigeria and 33 per cent in Mozambique.
28 per cent in Gambia and 20 per cent in Angola.
17 per cent in Ethiopia and 8 per cent in Kenya.
1 per cent in The Gambia and 44 per cent in Mauritius.
A significant 89 per cent of the population aged 15 and over has not completed primary education, with these levels the highest in the Least Developed Countries and second-highest in Africa (World Bank, 2012).
Even within national borders, the education challenges vary widely. Within the same country, some children and young people may have a better chance of success than others. Even in the same school within a given district, the quality of the school can differ greatly in terms of infrastructure, access to educational resources and classroom structure. Girls, ethnic or religious minorities, children with disabilities and children from poor families are more likely to have a lower quality of education, and their ability to excel is",475,4,2467

The history of physics is a long and fascinating journey that has evolved through the years, reflecting the profound impact science has on our lives. From early experiments with motion and forces to the development of modern concepts and theories, physics has played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of the universe.

1. Ancient Physics: The early phases of physics date back to ancient civilizations, where scholars such as Aristotle and Archimedes made significant contributions to our understanding of physical phenomena. Their writings provided the foundation for later scientific discoveries.

2. Classical Physics: In the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton formulated his laws of motion and universal gravitation, laying the groundwork for classical physics. This era also saw the development of calculus, a mathematical tool crucial for understanding physical systems.

3. Modern Physics: The early 20th century marked a major turning point with the introduction of quantum mechanics and special relativity by physicists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Max Planck, and others. These developments challenged traditional notions of space, time, and matter, leading to profound insights into the fundamental nature of reality.

4. Today's Physics: Ongoing research in fields such as particle physics, astrophysics, and condensed matter physics continues to shape our understanding of the cosmos and fundamental particles. Modern physics is also exploring the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the search for dark matter candidates, such as axions.

Physics is important for various reasons, including:

1. Technology advancement: The development of new technologies, such as nuclear power, computers, and medical imaging, is largely driven by scientific breakthroughs in physics. These technologies have transformed our daily lives and continue to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible.

2. Engineering and design: Understanding physics principles helps engineers design safe, efficient, and functional machines, structures, and systems. From bridges and airplanes to computers and smartphones, physics plays a vital role in engineering disciplines.

But there are at least two limitations to this approach: (1) The ""right"" answer might not be so obvious. If we define our problem clearly and thoroughly, we are more likely to reach a correct conclusion. If our definition of the problem is unclear, we may find more than one correct conclusion, or even no correct conclusion. (2) The method for discovering the right answer might not be obvious. We can determine that a certain answer is correct, but without a method for arriving at that answer, we are still in the dark. To improve the odds of finding the right solution to a problem, mathematicians work from two different perspectives: the deductive method (top-down reasoning) and the inductive method (bottom-up reasoning). 
Over time, mathematics developed in a fairly logical and orderly fashion. The Babylonians were quite talented when it came to arithmetic (vertical calculation) and geometry, but by about 2,000 BC, geometry and algebra became separate subjects. Before that, geometry and algebra (horizontal arithmetic) were parts of the same discipline, the analytic geometry of computing problems. The ancient Greeks made great advances with an individual approach, which was especially true for geometry. Euclid, the author of some of the most famous writing in mathematics, compiled many of the works on geometry that were discovered. However, today's approach to geometry can be traced to Tartaglia's trial and error method, resulting in a complete understanding of the new field of algebra. 
Mathematics involves a process of examining and creating both formal systems of ideas and informal systems based on heuristic (trial-and-error) reasoning. Even today's methods of mathematics are heuristic. This approach is very different from the deductive approach of a higher power such as God. Not long ago, mathematicians attempted to create equations representing basic principles by which the universe would operate. As it turned out, mathematics that has no apparent purpose at all is more likely to show up. There is not necessarily a relationship between deductive and inductive methods of reasoning. However, deductive and inductive methods of reasoning do have different implications for mathematical discovery. 
For example, imagine a very important problem, a sort of turning point for a new generation of mathematics. Perhaps it may have been good timing that played a role in the design of the problem, and we want to know whether that timing of the problem was good. When we use the inductive method, we discover",520,4,2621

Meteorology and weather forecasting are interesting fields that involve data analysis and understanding weather patterns. Python is an excellent programming language for data analysis and can be used to perform weather forecasting calculations. In this article, we will discuss the basics of meteorology and how to get started with using Python for weather forecasting.

What is meteorology?

Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere and weather patterns. It involves collecting and analyzing data on various atmospheric variables such as temperature, pressure, wind, and humidity. Meteorologists use this information to make predictions about weather patterns and to study the impact of weather on human activities and the environment.

The basic components of weather forecasting

Weather forecasting involves three basic components:

1. Understanding the current atmospheric conditions
2. Identifying the patterns in the atmosphere
3. Predicting the future atmospheric conditions

Using Python for weather forecasting

Python has several libraries and tools that make it a great choice for meteorology and weather forecasting. Here are some ways that you can use Python for weather forecasting:

1. Collecting atmospheric data: Python can be used to collect and store atmospheric data from various sources, including weather stations, satellites, and radar.

2. Data analysis: Once you have collected the data, Python can be used to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends in the atmospheric variables.

3. Weather models: Python can be used to build weather models that simulate the atmospheric conditions and predict future weather patterns.

4. Visualization: Python can be used to create visualizations of weather data, including maps, graphs, and charts, to help meteorologists understand the atmospheric patterns.

Summary

In conclusion, meteorology and weather forecasting are interesting fields that involve data analysis and understanding weather patterns. Python is an excellent programming language for data analysis and can be used to perform weather forecasting calculations. By using Python for weather forecasting, meteorologists can make more accurate weather predictions and improve the accuracy of weather warnings.

How does Python help meteorologists make more accurate weather predictions?

Python helps meteorologists make more accurate weather predictions in several ways:

1. Data analysis: Python provides powerful data analysis tools that allow meteorologists to analyze large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This means that meteorologists can make more accurate predictions about weather patterns based on the data they collect.

2. Weather models: Python can be used to build weather models that simulate atmospheric conditions and predict future weather patterns. These models take into account various factors such as temperature, pressure, wind, and humidity, and can help meteorologists make more accurate predictions about weather patterns",515,4,3036
65,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," for sportspeople and runners in particular are that athletes need more calories or carbohydrates. However, this is not the case. In fact, athletes need to be in a state of relative energy deficiency to optimise the training they are doing and move closer to their goals. Carbohydrate intake is of extreme importance during training, but should not be the focus for the majority of a runner's diet.
There is a lot of misconception around nutrition in sportspeople and runners in particular, largely fuelled by the mainstream media, and what they call the ""orthodox"" or more traditional diet views.
A lot of conventional wisdom regarding nutrition for both elite and recreational sportspersons states that calorie intake should be increased and carbohydrates should be increased. This couldn't be further from the truth, and in fact underpins all of our research on carbohydrate restriction.
Consuming more carbohydrate during the days in which athletes are training or competing is essential if they want to reap the benefits from their efforts, both in training and competition. However, on the whole, when people look at the literature on sports nutrition, they are looking at calorie counts, when carbohydrate is the key factor in improving both the intensity and the volume of training or performance. Research across many sports including racing and endurance sport, and also resistance-based sports, shows the magnitude of the contribution that carbohydrate restriction can make in athletes.
One of the most critical elements in exercise is energy efficiency. In fact, research shows that sportspersons are almost 50% more efficient at powering work via fat energy system than carbohydrate energy system. This, however, only applies to elite sportspeople, and if exercise is performed at high intensities – running in particular – carbohydrate is the dominant energy source. In races under 30 minutes, up to 100% of an athletes' energy supply is supplied by their carbohydrates stores. However, when an athlete increases their volume of training and exercise by longer than 30 minutes, performance may be optimised by increasing the percentage of fat energy that is generated from the body through fueling.
A real-life example of this was found in one of our most recent studies, whereby ultramarathon athletes had their energy intake calculated and showed an energy deficit of 30%. This deficit had a positive effect on their performance in the race. All of the athletes in our group gained both a psychological and physiological adaptation to doing exercise in the fat energy system. This allowed them to carry on with much higher volumes of exercise and, in particular, much higher volumes of training",556,4,2710

This period also saw the beginning of building of temples with special emphasis on meditation halls.
During the earlier ages, meditation was closely associated with ceremonies. Later with the growth in the concept of Ishwar the notion of Ishwar being jealous of the good acts or devotional practices of one when indulged in them was prevalent. This was mainly for the monks and nuns, people who had renounced the world. This feeling soon declined when people started believing that if Ishwar is god it should also be good and vice versa.
Then followed the period of quiet reflection, when the focus was more on the mind and meditation as a means to spirituality.
Not everyone understands meditation even today, the primary reason being that some still believe meditation is hard and doing it is difficult. This statement however, is false for without practicing nothing is learnt. Therefore it takes dedication and patience to learn and master any kind of meditation.
Another misconception about meditation is, that it makes us lazy, non-effective or crazy. This again is not true.
The primary and simplest form of meditation is Bija Mantra Meditation.
When an echo is heard in a cave or a symphony orchestra in a concert hall, we experience the echo of the sound because of the lack of emptiness in the body. The same situation also prevails when a person remains engrossed in his own thoughts. Even when we hear a different sound it will instantly change to the original. A negative thought is quickly replaced by another negative thought. If the same thoughts are repeated a million times we will grow within ourselves a symphony orchestra. When we realize that although we may be sitting in a deep meditative state we are still being affected by the same positive or negative thoughts in our day to day life, then we begin to question the existence of deep meditation.
The true purpose of meditation lies in the first step where the mind gets transformed and the eternal voice within, the voice of the Self, expresses itself in our awareness. This is true concentration, for the mind is being withdrawn from all external activities and is turning inwards towards itself. In this state the thoughts are exchanged for awareness and the emptiness for love. Now there is no desire or distraction in the mind, no thoughts of seeking pleasure. In fact",508,4,2599

We love all science, so you won't be surprised to hear us gushing about the glories of geology. It's a science that can involve trips to volcanoes and sunny beaches, and has a surprising amount of wonder in its very name. What's more, geology covers everything from atoms to engineering - a natural talent for the subject is useful for climbing the greasy pole in more than one field.
But, as is the case with any STEM discipline, geology is sometimes wrongly perceived as complicated and boring. For many of us the best way to convince people is through fun facts. Well look no further, as below you'll find some of our favourite and most interesting factoids.
The Pillars of Hercules are actually mountain goats
The Pillars of Hercules are often referred to as the border between Europe and Africa. But actually, this so called ‘boundary’ is completely made up. A massive earthquake destroyed the much of the narrow passage that today is held up by the coastlines of Portugal and Morocco. As a result of this earthquake, the two cliffs nearly touched. The geography community soon agreed that these two ‘pillars’ of rock were in fact mountain goats. This is another example of how geology, specifically the study of tectonic plates, has helped the world science revolution.
The strongest earthquake ever recorded was so strong it killed an elephant.
In 1960, an 8.7 magnitude earthquake struck Chile. The energy released by the event was so strong, it registered on a scale that begins at 1 and ends at 10. To put that into perspective, the energy released was on the same scale as a 1905 assassination attempt on President Theodore Roosevelt. On the moment the earthquake hit, an elephant walking on a beach was killed by a wave. None of the other animals in the vicinity escaped unharmed.
Geology, more like Jesus-ology
While christians are still arguing the veracity of the last supper, a more humble history of Christ awaits the devout among us. As it happens, many biblical quotes from the New Testament are lifted almost verbatim from the books of Isaiah and Ezekiel. The books of revelation are also rife with geology.

When starting out in photography, the best thing is just to jump in and learn from what you do. Don’t be put off by a smart phone camera. If you have that, you have the world’s number one photographer’s tool. You just need to learn the settings and what they do. I started out on a smart phone and then later moved on to a DSLR before buying my first camera (our Kodak Instamatic). I took that for a whole holiday and learned how to use it well.
Camera focal length and zoom are a great way to start to learn about camera settings.
For those who prefer a more mainstream explanation, we like Tamron’s explanation of focal length for understanding this aspect of photography.
Another tip for getting started with photography is to work on learning about the different elements of a photo, known as the ‘story’ of a photo. Maybe this means learning to improve your family photos, or landscape photography, or building a portrait photography portfolio. This means getting down on the ground to get a new perspective, or shooting from strange angles to try and make every photo you take to be unique. This could include, getting up high for certain photos like sunrises, or always looking for a way of making a photo in a busy street to have a new and unique perspective (like the photo of the ‘broken golden hours’ above, where I lay down in the street to take that shot). We cover many ideas like this throughout this site, and much more in our eBook.
One of the things that really helps a lot to improve your photography is to learn how to use filters on your lenses. These are special tools that you put in front of your lenses to change the color or quality of your photos. Of course this is a handy thing for a professional photographer who can get very expensive professional filters and they certainly help, but even beginners can buy filters that are cheap enough to experiment with. Most smartphone camera apps will allow you to use filters, but you can learn a lot from starting to use professional filters, even if it’s only when you put your phone or camera up to your window and experiment with the different colors that you can add to a photo.
Filters used for the purpose of photography are often referred to as ‘artistic’ filters, and a good site to get filters for any photography need is eBay, where you can get a very good range of quality products for a very reasonable price.

On Dec. 11, 2019, Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government (now known as the Ford government) announced sweeping cuts to operating grants and capital funding for public universities.
“Through actions such as capping tuition, creating a new grant for equity recipients and increasing OSAP, we have done more for students in one year than any other government in history,” Premier Doug Ford said. “At the same time, we have been dramatically reducing our debt and we will always support and invest in our youth.”
Since these cuts took effect on Jan. 1, 2020, universities across the province have braced for the financial impacts. In response, academic leaders have shared the following stories to illustrate the ways in which the research, teaching, learning, and service of universities matter for Ontarians.
My father’s story—Mississauga Community College
Late in 1972, David McDonald was paid a random visit by his previous employer, the University of Toronto.
The company wanted to design the new Centennial College in Scarborough. His boss, Ted Carlson, asked David if he’d be interested in becoming Centennial College’s first ever chief technology officer.
His position would also include the role of director of computer services—his main responsibilities would be to build the campus’s first computer systems, located in a drab concrete cube building called the Open Learning Centre, or OLC.
Needless to say, David was beyond thrilled.
“Ted said: ‘Well, I’d like to get it started in a couple of years if you’re interested,’” David recalled. “So, I immediately thought, ‘Okay, well, I’ll plan on taking those courses I never took back at university.’”
It turned out that one of the primary reasons David wasn’t hired by U of T was because he had studied engineering, which made him an “ideal fit” for the role he landed at Centennial. “If you’re an engineer, the way you think is to build things that make sense,” David said.
Indeed, as he began to build out the hardware and software that would transform the OLC into an exciting new kind of learning center, David found himself building a university for Centennial students— and for the much larger community that would eventually surround it.
Now a senior manager of environmental services at the City of Mississauga, he still thinks about the purpose behind the design decisions he made during that time.

In this essay, I will discuss the impact of politics on different aspects of modern society. Politics has a direct influence on the economy. Governments are responsible for policies that affect the economy, such as monetary policy, taxation, and regulation. For example, government spending can stimulate the economy or curb its growth. Taxes can affect consumer spending and production, and government regulation can impact industries.
Politics also has an impact on social issues. Governments are responsible for policies that affect social issues, such as healthcare, education, and human rights. For example, government spending on healthcare can affect access to healthcare, and policies around education can affect the quality of education. Human rights policies can impact the rights of certain groups of people, such as women or minorities.
Additionally, politics can impact the media. Governments control access to information and can use it to promote their agendas. Governments can also limit the freedom of the press, which can impact the accuracy and objectivity of news coverage.

77,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is a core skill in data science. Sports can be very complex in their own right, but can also be approached as a data science problem, by first building a model of the game from fundamental principles. Having identified the model of the game, it can then be used to generate predictions that might be interesting to make. These can be modelled in more than one way, and so predictions can sometimes be made more accurately and efficiently by integrating them within the appropriate game model. When generating predictions about the future in this way, this approach uses a lot of statistics.

This example of first principles of the game of rugby shows that and why this kind of integration of predictions does work. It uses the two fundamental aspects of a rugby game that are commonly used to model it: the field and the score.

Sports data often comes in the form of individual instance (such as a football, a time series of the scores of a race, a cumulative score in cricket, and so on). Prediction based on these instance is somewhat harder than that which is based on datasets that naturally comprise vectors: histories of time series in the same space. This is why we prefer to use this kind of dataset: it is easier to predict based on it. However, sometimes individual instances are easier to find. Here we show some simple illustration of this kind of issue in action.

78,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and the development of poetic forms.
Poetry is one of the oldest forms of literary expression and has a long and complex history. Its earliest form dates back to ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Greece. In ancient times, poetry was used for religious and ceremonial purposes, to describe historical events, to express social commentary, and to celebrate the natural world. Many of the early forms of poetry were in the form of stories, epics, and odes.

During the Middle Ages, poetry took on a new role, with the rise of monasticism, the literary and artistic works of the troubadours, the poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer, and the works of William Shakespeare. During the Renaissance, the focus shifted to the individual and the emotions, and poets began experimenting with new forms like sonnets and the haiku.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, poetry continued to evolve, with poets such as John Donne and Alexander Pope introducing new formal structures and the rise of the Romantic movement. The Romantic poets sought to capture the beauty and majesty of the natural world, and emphasized the importance of individual experience, emotion, and imagination.

In the 20th century, poets were influenced by the political and social changes of the time, and experimented with various new forms of poetry, including free verse, concrete poetry, and jazz poetry. Contemporary poets continue to explore new techniques and approaches to poetry, while also paying homage to the classic forms of the past.

The development of poetic forms has been shaped by historical and cultural influences, as well as by the changing nature of literature and communication. From the earliest works of Homer to the poetry of contemporary poets, poetry has been a vital and dynamic art form that continues to evolve and inspire.

Can you give me more information about the Jazz Poetry of the 20th century? Who were some of the most notable poets associated with this movement?
Certainly! Jazz poetry emerged in the 1920s and 1930s as a way for African American poets to express their experiences of racism, discrimination, and oppression. They borrowed the rhythms and cadences of jazz music and combined them with poetic language to create a new form of expression that was both musical and literary.

One of the most notable poets associated with this movement is Langston Hughes, who is often credited with coining the term ""jazz poetry."" Hughes was a leading voice of the Harlem Renaissance and his poems often incorporated jazz rhythms and blues imagery to tell stories",486,4,2573

One sunny afternoon, as Lily was potting some new flowers, she noticed that her garden was lacking a certain magical touch. Sure, it was full of blooms and buzzing bees, but something was missing. And then, as if by magic, she saw a tiny fairy fluttering by!

""Hello there, little fairy,"" Lily said, her eyes sparkling. ""What can I do for you today?""

""Hello, Lily,"" the fairy replied in a whispery voice. ""I've heard that you love to garden. I'm here to help you add a little whimsy to your beloved green space.""

Lily's heart skipped a beat as she watched the fairy sprinkle some dust over her garden. Suddenly, every flower had a bright, colorful glow, and every blade of grass had a soft, gentle shimmer. And to top it all off, all the bees had wings and were flying around in circles!

""Gosh, that's beautiful!"" Lily exclaimed, looking around at all the sparkling flowers. ""I never knew a little dust could do so much.""

The fairy grinned at her, and the two of them began chatting about all sorts of magical gardening adventures. They talked about the power of sprinkles to bring wishes to life, and the delight of growing wildflowers that bloom in the moonlight.

Nonetheless, once you ask what precisely is the that means of some tracks you may find out that there isn’t a precise that means or that folks inside totally different cultures and totally different eras want the identical music tracks.

81,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," a tricky question to answer. As of now, it's not even known if we will end up with the final answer, or if we will need a 6th quantum theory to explain it. However, we know that something will happen, as we have first and second order quantum fluctuations. These are various disturbances (for example, particle creation) that may occur in a quantum system. 

What could these quantum fluctuations predict that the standard model fails to give? Or in other words, how do these quantum fluctuations let us see that we live in a weird world where quantum mechanics trumps the second law of thermodynamics?

EDIT: I meant second order fluctuations. 1. #### Quantum Probability and Decoherence

Rather than from being too loose with the language, I take this as from [this article](https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/andersons-theorem-why-the-matter-in-the-world-lives-everywhere-but-in-places-where-we-are-not-observing-it) where it mentions ""undecayed matter."" This is an example of [quantum decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence). There are no mathematical proofs, but quantum mechanics is considered probabilistic and when it exists at low temperatures and in small systems, i.e. the size of atoms, this principle plays a huge role.

1. #### Entanglement

This is one of my favorite parts of quantum mechanics. I'm not exactly sure what kinds of quantum fluctuations are being referred to here. Entanglement happens when two particle systems become intertwined in such a way that the two states of these particles are not alone. They are in a relationship. You might also see this as [“non-local entanglement.”](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n06/nick-hastings/non-local-entanglement) More specifically, this is a quantum effect whereby the quantum state of one particle is a superposition of two states. So it is in the entanglement quantum mechanism that there are no clear-cut clearly separated particles, thus making the “things” of the universe [quanta](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n06/nick-hastings/non-local-entanglement) of which it is made (i.e. space).

A recent set of related papers have compared different machine learning paradigms for a variety of applications (Horse Race: Comparing Tree (Histogram) based, Statistical and Neural Network classifiers. BMVC 2004; E. Kolter and W. van Platerink, SPRINT: a fast and efficient classifier for large data sets. Journal of Machine Learning Research 4 (2003): 567-589; Goerg and Yang, 2007). Each approach, while promising in its own right, has limitations that prevent it from becoming the dominant paradigm for large, image-based processing problems, such as mammography. We have identified a set of requirements necessary to meet a need for consistent quantitative image processing results in applications requiring large processing volumes. These requirements are (1)the ability to train on a modest data set to get results comparable to current practice, (2) faster classification than is currently attainable, (3) less than a 2 second processing time, and (4) no substantial resource requirements (memory and disk). The software we have developed to meet these requirements has been integrated into a commercial system used for mammographic screening and image-guided radiation therapy. The software has been tested on mammographic images from 8,000 patients from 5 centers around the U.S., with associated ground truth from independent readers to derive ROC performance metrics. Most importantly, results using the hardware and software constructed to meet these requirements compare favorably with most published mammographic performance metrics.",317,4,1624

I can provide you with a brief history of robotics. here it goes:

the history of robotics dates back to the late 1800s and early 1900s, with the invention of mechanical toys and automatons. these early examples of robotics were simple machines that performed basic movements, such as turning a crank to move a toy figure.

during the mid-20th century, robotics began to evolve into more complex forms. this period saw the development of industrial robots that could perform repetitive tasks such as welding and painting. these robots were controlled by programmable logic controllers (plcs) and used mechanical actuators, such as hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders.

in the 1980s, the introduction of personal computers and microprocessors revolutionized the field of robotics. computer control systems and electronic sensors allowed for greater precision and accuracy in robot movements, opening up new possibilities for applications in fields such as manufacturing and space exploration.

in recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have made robots more intelligent and adaptable. this has led to the development of robots that can learn from their environment and perform tasks such as navigation and object recognition.

currently, robotics is used in a wide range of industries and applications, including healthcare, transportation, agriculture, and entertainment. with further advancements in technology, it is expected that robots will continue to play an increasingly important role in our lives.

That's interesting! Can you give me some examples of real-life applications of robotics today?
Sure, here are some examples of real-life applications of robotics:

1. Manufacturing and assembly: Industrial robots are used in factories to automate tasks such as welding, painting, and assembly. These robots work consistently, quickly and can perform repetitive movements without getting tired, saving time and effort for workers.

2. Agriculture: Autonomous robots are used in farming to monitor crops, plant seeds and collect data about soil and weather conditions. This helps farmers to optimize crop yields, save water, and reduce labor costs.

3. Healthcare: Surgical robots are used to perform minimally invasive surgeries with high precision, reducing patient recovery times and improving outcomes. Other robots are used for tasks such as dispensing medication, monitoring patient vital signs, and providing companionship for the elderly.

4. Space exploration: Robots are used extensively in space exploration to perform tasks such as collecting samples from distant planets, repairing solar panels, and conducting scientific experiments. This helps to reduce the risk to human astronauts and allows for longer and more complex missions.

5. Entertainment: Robots are used in theme parks",513,4,2837

A New Approach in Market Research
Our research is guided by cutting edge methodologies in areas that include: behavioural, transformational, cultural, communications and demographic analysis. Using quantitative and qualitative information, along with observation, our team can design and implement new approaches to generate client insights on market research.
Our Approach
MedAdWise's market research team uses a multi-faceted approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative research with in-depth, field-based interviews with physicians. Qualitative research allows us to learn patients' challenges, concerns and preferences; while quantitative research allows us to measure the frequency and reach of these choices. To truly understand the market, we apply a combined behavioural, cultural, demographic and communications-based analysis.
Demographic & Cultural Analysis
MedAdWise works with the world’s leading researchers to assess behavioural, generational, cultural, and demographic data relevant to physicians and patients. While physicians tend to be similar across nations, the consumers they treat and the context in which physicians work varies widely. To get a true understanding of the market, it is essential to understand the population of physicians and patients that a drug is sold to. This information can help firms tailor and innovate their products, identify new directions for advertising campaigns and develop appropriate pricing strategies.
Our Demographic & Cultural Analysis research has produced data that has helped our clients identify new growth opportunities and make predictions for their sales pipeline, pricing and marketing strategies. Some of our current demographic and cultural analyses include: regional differences, generational differences, health economics, preference study, perceptions research, and market segmentation.
Communications and Communications Testing
MedAdWise works with top-level thought leaders to monitor and control a product's communications strategy in order to ensure a smooth launch. Our communications testing service includes combination testing of in-market and pilot-market communications. This allows us to evaluate both short-term and long-term communications strategies. We offer our clients an extremely flexible approach. Our services go beyond traditional media evaluation, incorporating communications research services such as questionnaire and letter testing, creative analysis, and understanding physician attitudes, preferences and habits.
Our Communications and Communications Testing services have also been employed in launching and evaluating some of the biggest pharmaceutical launches in recent years. Some of our recent services include evaluation",514,4,3020

While it has been difficult to imagine how other manufacturing industries could benefit from such technology, this is now becoming a reality. In September 2014, Agfa Graphics’ parent company, Crescent Ametek in Belgium, entered into a strategic alliance with a Dutch robotics company to address this trend.
The result is ARTIS Innovation, a partnership that has resulted in the first fully robotic wide-format dye sublimation solution. The next-generation Eagle printer is designed to further enhance the hot melt transfer process that is revolutionizing wide-format product decoration, creating new design possibilities for fabrics, signage, novelty items and promotional items, while delivering the soft feel and look of merchandise that consumers appreciate. The Eagle innovation uses automation and robotics to further reduce problems inherent in manual production operations, thereby delivering higher quality and greater consistency.
Company founder Cornelius Stamper is a pioneer in digital textile and garment decoration and has been at the forefront of the evolution and development of the industry. He established his first company, TJ Design, in 1982. Since then, it has grown to become the largest supplier in Europe of printing machinery for digital printing. It has also supplied extensive consultancy services. During the last decade, TTC has partnered with Agfa Graphics, a leading supplier of chemicals and consumables, to create a joint platform for the production of textiles and industrial printing processes. This partnership has resulted in the latest offering in this sector – ARTIS Innovation. ARTIS Innovation offers an integrated automation and robotics solution to solve the challenges of batch size, quality, color and efficiency.
The Eagle digital transfer printer has a number of innovations designed to replace manual processes with robotic automation:
- An automated calender unit – which applies a soft touch to the fabric after it has been printed. The roll, roll-to-roll fabric continues through the calender unit, where the fabric (which needs to go through the calender at 140℃ to produce the soft feel of an actual garment) is warmed and fused with the printed media. Once ready, the material passes through a quality inspection system, and is then ready to be cut.
- A robotic flame service unit in the post-print sublimation process – The Eagle uses innovative heat management technology based on infrared radiators that deliver accurate heat to the material as it passes through the printing area. Once the material exits the first section of printing, it is manually loaded into a robot service",510,4,2798

Exploring the site will ultimately lead to answering many questions about the ongoing re-interpretation of the Buena Vista formation in the southern Cumberland Mountains. site? Actually, the name comes from late prehistoric archaeological field work done at the site by local archaeologist Dr. Elmer R. Smith. He was intrigued by the coincidence of the name during WWII, which was when the S. J. Hossley Coal Company purchased the property. The earliest archaeological work at Break Point was conducted in the mid-1960’s, which did not indicate a significant shift in occupation of the site from prehistoric to historic Native American use. We have been fortunate enough to be involved in a wide variety of research efforts associated with the site, including excavation of both nineteenth and twentieth century activity; analysis of Euro-American trade items recovered from the Moccasin Gap phase (1790-1840 AD) and other prehistoric occupations; and investigation of post-historic potential caves at the site. These efforts have been under the direction of Ms. Hope Dunavant, who has received several grants for this work from the Tennessee Department of Education and the Tennessee Anthropological Association. Information on current excavations at the site and access to previously collected artifacts can be accessed on the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation site at. For those who are unaware, the sate of Tennessee has one of the largest deposits of coal in the country, if not the largest, and the sites of its extraction and use are of interest to geologists, scholars, and amateur enthusiasts alike.

87,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is a rapidly developing field that examines the ways the ocean science community behaves and how its members' efforts affect the ocean environment. Ethics matters in science have emerged in the wake of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). Prior to that, the scientific community interpreted ethical concerns as a low-priority afterthought, and scientists assumed that peer review would take care of ethical issues. A different view exists now. The oceans provide a research environment that presents unique challenges to researcher behavior. On the one hand, ""global changes"" debates require research on regional to global scales where observations are largely data-dense with high levels of complexity. On the other hand, there are data-poor regions, and researchers must be very sensitive to contexts that may pose ethical dilemmas. On-ship activities, including core handling, field work, and data retention, must be conducted with great care and respect.
We introduce the topics we will cover in this chapter. First, we explore the ""sustainability of core materials"" (SCM) and the ""sustainability of core handling"" (SCH), including the relationship between the two. We then examine the implications of adding collaborative elements to marine core science. The final topic explores the parallel impacts of citizen scientists and ""citizen journalism"" on oceanographic research and asks if this technology presents ethical dilemmas.
From 2003 to 2010, the Center for Coastal Margin Observation and Prediction (CMOP), funded by the National Science Foundation, conducted a multi-year project designed to ""identify, characterize, manage, and predict the human footprint on the coastal margins."" The overall goals were to examine the sustainability of physical and biological functions in coastal watersheds, and the sustainability of human operations on the coast. A key component of the CMOP activities was to quantify a ""social driver"" in these projects to assess impacts from human activities, termed sustainability of core material (SCM). The SCM of core handling was understood here as the ability to conserve the integrity of deep sea cores for the next generation of ocean scientists and the management of the cores while on shore. In 2010, CMOP/IODP launched its Core/Group Diversity Initiative that included the development of shared standardized procedures for data organization, digitization, and analytical methods. This grew out of a series of pilot studies in which CMOP investigators worked together to bring together the scientific and socioeconomics data that are essential for moving coastal marginal studies into the future.

90,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," with this ultimate guide to kick start your learning journey. This guide includes what is machine learning, its methods and algorithms and how can it help various industries, besides, this guide provides a guide to getting started with machine learning. If you haven’t started yet, and have been wondering where to start with this tech, then this guide will help get you started with Machine Learning.

This is the most important question you have, why would you want to do Machine Learning? That’s the most important question one needs to ask, before diving into the concepts of machine learning. Here is a list of problems with current techniques that Machine Learning can solve:

• Image Classification
• Translation
• Data retrieval
• Speech Recognition
• Language Translation
• Search
• Recommender Systems
• Computers can play games like chess (Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo)

### Obtaining the training data

Data is the lifeblood of machine learning algorithms, without it, it would be impossible to create a machine learning algorithm. All machine learning algorithms utilize large amounts of data. This may sound straightforward, but it is not the case.

### Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm

In machine learning, there are algorithms for things like object recognition. There are decision trees for example, to recognize a pattern in an image. There are also many more algorithms to be aware of. There are logistic regressions, randomized trees, linear regression, k-nearest-neighbors, SVMs, to name a few. A lot of these algorithms could be combined, even though they may not explicitly do so.

### Tuning the hyperparameters of the algorithm

We have to select an algorithm, whether it be logistic regression, k-nearest-neighbors, or even k-means. From this, there are things like number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer of a neural network, sampling method, subsample percent, to name a few. Many of the hyperparameters are dependent on each other, and hyperparameter tuning is what could allow the machine to outperform humans.

### Model selection and validation

While it is important to make a model, it is also important to find what results you are looking for. However, your research should not end at model selection. It is important to select a validation process, which would help you decide which model would do best. Even though decision trees are easy to interpret, cross-validation may be needed for their training and testing. Choosing appropriate metrics is needed for model selection as well. These are often multi-class classification, and regression.

Some of the authors are not very familiar with the literature on the upper Miocene tillisols so it seems that they should reconsider their choice to present their work at such a large conference.
Are such talks really useful to the field? Do paleo-geologists come to know about the region only from such abstracts? Do the abstracts contain error-prone and irrelevant information?

Research that incorporates subtle aspects of quantum mechanics has given rise to new particles and phenomena, leading physicists to rethink their theories and to propose new strategies for uncovering additional phenomena.

These developments have triggered major interest in using high-power lasers to investigate phenomena that include relativistic plasma behavior, the interaction of electromagnetic waves with a plasma, photon and matter interactions and gravitational lensing. Lasers are used to initiate high-energy accelerators and to control their operation; they are used to measure the interaction of electromagnetic waves and matter, and to develop technologies for laser fusion. In addition, lasers offer a powerful tool for quantum computation and for studying the interaction of laser pulses with plasma in the laboratory, and they can induce unidirectional space-time modifications in the propagation of light.

The new and explosive growth of laser science and technology is especially encouraging for young physicists who study lasers. A generation of laser researchers has grown up since the 1970s, stimulated by the rise of the modern laser and its exploitation to address fundamental questions in physics and the science of information. These researchers now have open opportunities to make theoretical and experimental contributions to one of the most dynamic research areas in physics.

The authors of this volume study the physics of lasers and explain its relevance for understanding the universe, probing the frontiers of laser and quantum science, and improving technologies for energy applications. They also explore new strategies for using lasers to probe phenomena not yet revealed.

This is the first detailed, broadly based volume on the physics of lasers and their applications. It provides the first forum for physicists with interests in lasers to meet, cross-fertilize ideas and discover ways to advance the science of lasers and their diverse applications. The volume presents the unique opportunity to learn about the scientific community’s advances in a single place, to learn about research frontiers and to discuss future directions and opportunities.

Borrowing heavily from both science and technology, these exhibitions examine the origins of the technical innovations, which have proven so inspiring to artists.
There are two outstanding figures from the development of photography with links to Linlithgow: Alexander Adam (1816-1884), who was an artistic contributor to the Edinburgh Photographic Society, which led the establishment of the Scottish Photographic Society and who was influential as a lecturer at the Edinburgh College of Art in photography and the relation of camera and lens to the image. And the historian of photography William Catherall Wroth, who resided in Linlithgow (1871-1957).
Artist like Mark Rothko and Cy Twombly, whose giant canvasses played with the expression of movement, have had a particular influence on modern sculpture and drawing, as has the work of Jackson Pollock, another giant of the painting world who broke away from the realistic approach to painting, and continued the trend for abstract art in the 1960s. More recently the imagination of artists such as Anthony Gormley and Tacita Dean has explored the human relationship with the environment. Both these artists have been the subject of solo exhibitions at Linlithgow Burgh Halls. Their works include land art and film, utilising natural materials in works that challenge the viewer to consider the changes that humans have had on the environment.
A burgeoning interest in video art, where the materiality of sound, text and image is celebrated, has been encouraged by innovations such as the iPod and digital cameras, and has had a part to play in the endurance and development of digital display at Linlithgow Burgh Halls with a local arts collective who work collaboratively and promote contemporary art.",371,4,1946

In your discussion, consider the nature of absurdity, the symbolism and symbolism, and the legacy of the Theatre of the Absurd movement. Please include at least five sources to support your analysis.

The Theater of the Absurd refers to a movement in drama and literature that emerged in the mid-20th century as a reaction against established and traditional plays. This genre challenges the fundamental aspects of conventional dramatic storytelling and explores the irrationality and randomness of life. The word ""absurd"" refers to a state of confusion and disorientation that stems from the realization that life's meaning and purpose are elusive or lacking.

The Theater of the Absurd characters are often anonymous and isolated individuals who experience feelings of alienation, disillusionment, and despair. The dialogue in these plays is often nonsensical and fragmented, with characters speaking in run-on sentences or exhibiting bizarre behavior. The setting is often mundane, in stark contrast to the gravity of the themes explored in the plays. Many plays in the Theater of the Absurd movement also use the presence of an audience to create a sense of alienation and unease.

Playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Harold Pinter, and Tom Stoppard are all associated with the Theater of the Absurd. Some of the most famous works in this genre include Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Ionesco's The Bald Soprano, Pinter's The Birthday Party, and Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.

One of the main goals of the Theater of the Absurd movement was to question the traditional notions of truth, reality, and meaning. It challenges the idea that there is any inherent value in the external world and suggests that our understanding of life is flawed and inadequate. By exposing the absurdity of human existence, these playwrights sought to provide a new perspective on the way we view the world.

The legacy of the Theater of the Absurd movement can still be seen in contemporary theater and literature. It has influenced movements such as Postmodernism, which also challenges the traditional structures of storytelling and communication. The movement also paved the way for other avant-garde movements such as Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, which sought to break free from traditional norms and explore the irrational aspects of human experience.

In conclusion, the Theater of the Absurd is a genre of drama and literature that challenges traditional notions of reality",505,4,2591

Fitness may be thought of as a science, or even an art, but it is definitely an obsession in our lives. Unfortunately, we sometimes think too much of it, and all that becomes an obsession itself, causing more harm than good. Our obsession can possibly lead to an extreme that is self-defeating, and some states of overdoing it, may even lead to some instances of self-destruction. But in most cases, we may be, in reality, obsessive about something completely different. For instance, we may be obsessed with the dislike of what we see in the mirror, and some of us work hard so that we look the way we like to. So, what is with the obsession?
Well, it happens that we become as in awe as possible, once we see that our hard work pays off. The motivation to look a certain way, is enhanced by a negative connotation, and therefore, we become obsessive about it. Once you are obsessed about something, you start to feel the need to be perfect, and if you are not, if there is even a slight inadequacy, you become devastated. That is why it is extremely important to avoid taking these “whatevers” to the point that one would believe that they are simply part of him or her. Very rarely will you find this kind of people who take their passion to a fault. But we have a fair deal of people who probably spend several hours sitting in front of their computers to look for places to download free printable workout calendar to add more to their knowledge about fitness, but their own families may start to be at a far end from them. Most of them are simply unhappy with what they see in the mirror.

In addition, it is my hope and aspiration that I will be able to act as a guiding figure for everyone associated with the Tokyo University of the Sacred Heart Education program, and offer guidance and support to those in need. Furthermore, I would like to make the education program for Japanese Studies, which is one of the pillars of the program, as successful as possible. I have my sights set on earning a doctorate in anthropology or ethnology in my future, so I would be able to study and perform field research at the site. In terms of education, I hope to aid students and faculty members to further understand their own experiences, and to create a wonderful environment in which all students can come together, teach and interact with one another. I also aspire to have the Tokyo University of the Sacred Heart Education program on Tokyo University of the Sacred Heart campus, since there is no direct connection with the main university in terms of the physical location. I also hope to be able to make Tokyo University of the Sacred Heart campus into a site of peace and safety, where those in need can receive support and comfort.
I believe the presence of the Tokyo University of the Sacred Heart Education program on campus will go a long way in fulfilling the university's mission to educate and prepare students for their future roles in a global world.
*As part of this new education experience, many activities that are now provided as part of the existing programs will now be provided by the Tokyo University of the Sacred Heart Education program. However, the Tokyo University of the Sacred Heart Education program is not merely designed to provide information on the Asian Studies Program. Rather, the purpose of the program is to provide an experience in order to enlighten and stimulate our students, as well as to conduct rigorous and thorough education programs. The Education program was designed in order to provide the necessary training and preparation for the students to succeed and gain the knowledge they need for their future in Japan, which will result in a productive future for the University of Tokyo.

I have an undergraduate maths degree and am learning all of this for a second and third degree. But I find that I don't understand the basic principles of quantum mechanics (from what I read online I just don't get the intuition).

Can someone explain to me, starting from first principles, what a probability distribution is, what a state is (in the real sense), why wave mechanics of particles came about, and the basic principles of the Schrodinger equation? And also on a conceptual level, what this says about the world, and how and why classical physics failed and quantum theory came about and how we can reconcile these two ways of thinking? And to tie it all together, I can study through books, if you could suggest a good book that explains all this to a reasonable level, I would appreciate it!

I would just like to also note that a significant chunk of the problems I have are due to the fact that I don't really understand what a probability is and what can be considered a probability, and I really think this lack of understanding is my biggest problem. For example, how can we say that a probability is only defined on a certain interval when the Heisenberg inequality states that something cannot be determined in certain ways? For example, the position of an electron cannot be determined simultaneously with momentum and the probability of the speed of an electron cannot be determined (by the momentum-position uncertainty). And there are other laws which state that some observables cannot be determined simultaneously? I really don't understand these things well enough so could someone give a basic explanation of these?

Ever heard of a wavefunction? – BMS May 19 '13 at 14:30
I have heard of a wavefunction but I don't know its conceptual significance. I assume it means that the ""probability density"" is being represented by a wave function, but what does that mean exactly? Does it mean that classical probability doesn't make sense since you never know the exact location of things? – BCLC Apr 18 '15 at 4:29
@BCLC: Roughly speaking, the wave function describes the state of the system. A probability is something that describes the state of some experiment, but at this stage, we are just describing the state of a single system (i.e. some property like position or momentum). In general, in quantum mechanics, we introduce the wavefunction as an excitation of the space of all possible states of a given system, which is",513,4,2456

In this blog post, I am writing a beginner's guide to robotics. All examples use the Arduino platform as the focus, however, the main programming idea carries across all types of platforms.

What is a robot?

A robot is a machine that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These machines are commonly controlled by a computer.

What is the difference between autonomous and semi-autonomous?

To perform autonomously, the robot is completely on its own. To perform semi-autonomously, the robot must operate under some type of guidance. For example, a robot that follows a line is semi-autonomous. The robot would be autonomous if it was following another more complex algorithm.

Why is the robot category very broad?

Just like humans, robots are incredibly diverse. They can be autonomous, semi-autonomous, have one or more computers, include sensors, be made of multiple different materials, etc. Once a robot is outside of these parameters, they will be called an artificial intelligence or something similar.

What exactly is an artificial intelligence?

An artificial intelligence is the field of study where humans attempt to make machines that can perform tasks that normally need human intelligence.

What does a robot need to do in order to be considered a robot?

This is also a very broad question. A robot can be simple, such as the Sphero robots that can roll around. It can also be complex, such as NASA’s Mars rover. This broadness makes it hard to even define the word, and many experts have different definitions for it.

There are many things that a robot must be able to do in order to be considered a real robot, instead of something else. What are these things?

Robot arms, legs, wheels, and many other things.

These are considered robot parts. Almost every robot needs some sort of arms, leg, etc., which allows them to interact with their environment.

A simple comparison

An example of a robot could be a robot arm. A robot arm can move and interact with the environment. Compare that to a set of hands. They are able to move around, pick objects up, and do almost everything a human arm can do. These robotic hands are very powerful. However, they lack one capability: they can’t perform a long list of human tasks. On top of that, they are limited by their type of input. In this example, there was no fine control. Although, some robotic arms do have that capability.

109,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," go back more than a century. In 1913 Henry M. Sheffer, a retired German professor, invented a device that shook a mechanical device, forced drops of water from a tiny test tube, and used the volume of the water to indicate the answer to certain problems. One use of this device, which researchers say is the world's first computer, was to teach a young Japanese child who was better able to distinguish between cherries and peas. The German-designed device was put on public display in the 1940s and was used by German researchers developing new kinds of robots. By the 1950s, psychologists had begun to create ""thinking machines"". Toward the end of that decade, Roger Bruhn, a researcher at the Stanford Research Institute in California, began to create a computer called the General Problem Solver. He went on to develop a form of artificial intelligence called operational research. This discipline is designed to produce not only mathematical models of problems but also tools that would help the individual and groups to set about solving them. By the mid-1970s, companies were beginning to use the computers for the first time. They were still quite expensive and required a large number of scientists to operate and maintain them. Yet their growth was exponential. Many more experts were needed and when few began to emerge from universities in the 1980s, companies hired them away from the libraries and advertising agencies. Over the next two decades, companies used computer systems to better understand and predict consumer behavior. In time, researchers began to find the systems more powerful than they had foreseen. They found the systems could conduct searches among millions of pieces of information in only a few seconds. In the 1990s, companies began to build systems that could carry out the work of advertising executives and accountants, negotiating experts, surveyors, and sometimes even chief executive officers. Artificial Intelligence has also caused some concern. Because there is no agreed-upon definition for artificial intelligence, the definition varies depending on the applications being studied. In general, the field is broken down into a number of subfields that are all very different from each other. For instance, this definition, ""An artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer to think,"" seems to suggest that when we have solved all the problems of vision, robotics, and pattern recognition, we will have solved the whole thing. The truth is, we are nowhere near that point. For example, image-recognition researchers can only manage to match a",489,4,2595

Studies from countries like the Philippines, Jordan, Mexico, Peru and Colombia have found that children who stay in school longer have longer life expectancies than those who leave school early. In China, educational attainment is a stronger predictor of life expectancy than indicators of wealth, such as per capita GDP. In Botswana, children who have stayed in school for longer have higher life expectancies, especially if they have stayed in school up to the age of 15.
We see education having a strong, positive effect in tackling some of the biggest challenges that face emerging countries in the coming decades. As global leaders gather this week to discuss the Sustainable Development Goals, The Jameel Poverty Action Lab’s Abu Aït-Hamad has a personal perspective that I hope will help inform the conversation: only 40% of children with disabilities in poor countries have ever had an education. The socio-economic benefits of education are especially large for these children, and the estimated cost of excluding them from education is about $90 billion a year.
Aït-Hamad’s work has focused on children with disabilities, and the issue is of great personal importance to him: his work is motivated by his own experiences growing up in a rural village in Tunisia. Most of the boys in his community were prevented from going to school by the medical opinion of the local doctor. He had to deal with the same restrictions. Fortunately, he was able to convince the doctor to allow him to attend a specialised school, and subsequently he was able to pursue a career in disability rehabilitation. His work led him to write his master thesis on the effects of age at admission to schooling, leading to what we now know as the “science of reading”: evidence from the world’s first randomized placebo controlled trial on reading instruction, showing that intensive reading instruction is highly effective. Aït-Hamad and his collaborators have since run follow up studies with over 15,000 participants showing that the benefits of childhood literacy are long lasting.
His work has now been joined by other academic centres and important international agencies, like the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) – one of The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab’s key partners in the international development community – to deliver long-lasting improvements in children’s literacy, for example through programs like PAARI-USAID’s",520,4,2692

Even general interests like the internet and games are being taken over and monopolized by the USA and if you want a site with alternatives you have to setup your own host. The Internet of Things is being adopted just like Xcom 2's Empire wants. Politically 2016 has left me with a lot of backlash and not much hope for improvement. That being said I am starting to grow tired of this shit and want to go full political and try to manipulate the world and change the shape of it.

The right thing would be to try and change the world in a friendly and just way. But what if I want to go a path of manipulation? What kind of a life is that for me? Let me pose this question, what is the optimal and fool proof way to start taking over the world and causing the maximum amount of trouble in a politically oriented manner? I have picked up a few things during my time on this site so far such as慢慢的，自信，cus or even personal change which I have spoken about before.

How can memorials honor an individual or event without selling out to narrative power, cultural correctness, and group identity?
The article does not provide a specific answer to this question.

As a matter of fact, what the author here called the ""memorials of things past"" represent only a small portion of memory.
The author does not appear to be conflating memorials with memory itself. The term ""memorials of things past"" refers to the way that memory and memorialization are conflated in modern society, to the extent that memorials are often seen as the only or primary way to remember the past.

I think it's also important to note that while memorials are important for memorialization, they are not the only or primary way to remember the past. We have many other ways of remembering, such as storytelling, art, literature, and our own personal memories.

Ok, then how can a non-memorial event be a memory?
Memories can take many forms beyond traditional memorials, such as stories, personal experiences, and conversations with others. Even something as simple as a personal reflection on the event or a discussion with others about it can create a memory.

Furthermore, our personal relationships with people or objects can be a type of ""memory"". For example, if I lived in a certain house and spent a lot of time there with my family, I would remember that house in that context.

I am not very clear about your last comment. You are saying that our personal relationships with people or objects can be a type of memory? Did you mean ""memorial"" rather than ""memory""?
Yes, I'm sorry if my last comment was not clear. By ""memory,"" I mean the act of remembering, not a physical object. Personal relationships and personal experiences, which involve interactions with other people and objects, can create memories that shape our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.

I disagree with your assessment that ""memorials represent only a small portion of memory.""
I agree that memorials are not the only way to remember the past, and that our personal relationships and personal experiences can also be important ways of remembering. However, memorials can be an important way to create a collective memory that shapes our understanding of the past and influences our actions in the present. They can also serve as a",504,4,2572

The ancient Greeks and Romans were the first to observe and record weather patterns, but the field of meteorology really began to take shape in the 17th century with the invention of the barometer. In 1643, the Dutch scientist Blaise Pascal invented the first barometer, which was used to measure air pressure and was an early tool for predicting weather.

During the 19th century, weather stations began to be set up around the world to record weather conditions such as temperature, pressure, wind speed, and precipitation. These observations were then used to create weather maps, which allowed scientists to make more accurate predictions about the weather.

In the 20th century, meteorology became more scientifically advanced with the development of new technologies such as satellites, computer models, and radar. These tools allow meteorologists to track storms, predict hurricanes, and study climate patterns.

Today, meteorology plays an important role in modern society. It provides critical information for aviation, transportation, agriculture, and emergency management. Accurate weather forecasts are essential for airlines, shipping companies, and other businesses that rely on the weather to plan their operations. Meteorologists also play a key role in forecasting and preparing for natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods.

In addition, meteorology has helped scientists understand and mitigate the effects of climate change. By analyzing climate data and developing climate models, meteorologists can track long-term trends and make predictions about how the planet's climate will change in the coming decades.

Can you explain how meteorologists use satellites to track weather patterns? Sure! Satellites are a crucial tool for meteorologists to track and analyze weather patterns. Here's how they work:

1. Climate Data and Satellite Imaging

Satellites capture images of the Earth's atmosphere and surface, which can help meteorologists understand patterns of air currents, clouds, and temperature.

2. Advantages of Satellites

Satellites provide a wide-angle view of the atmosphere and can capture images in visible and infrared light, which is helpful for distinguishing different cloud types and tracking the movement of storms. They can also detect changes in atmospheric gases, including water vapor and carbon dioxide, which help scientists understand the climate.

3. Satellite Meteorology

Satellites can also be used to measure temperature, humidity, and precipitation. By measuring changes in temperature and humidity, meteorologists can track the development of storms and predict when and where precipitation will fall.

The common concept underlying both works is the idea of relativity of social behaviors and values, particularly with regard to contemporary liberal democratic values. While the first work covers the emergence of an american nation, with special attention to the formation of its society and culture, this second work focuses on the process of westernization and acculturation of russian intellectuals in the United States and the very process of molding ideas and attitudes, particularly the idea of social relativism, which preceded the emergence of, and acted as an influence for, the formation of the American philosophy. Being another facet of the same question of the purpose, the question of the import of the cultural relevancy of technology reveals itself. At the moment when the nation will become a ‘nation-state’, as Polanyi and Tonnies call it, the question of unifying the nation-state in a brand new society will require the solving of many interesting problems. Two of these problems are related to the cultural problems of a collective national identity and the technological development of a society which is inherently different from those of the western world. Failing to solve these problems satisfactorily will create these limitations within the historical period in question.
Arguably, the problems surrounding the issue of building a nation-state in which the aesthetic and ideological values of the society in question are coordinated and meaningful to the population are not as complex as they seem. In essence, we define nationality as the relation of ‘being of the same identity’ of a group of people who share common values. Paradoxically, this definition does not preclude that there exist specific cultures and norms within that nationality, some belonging to those who will never identify themselves with it and, in fact, may consider the people who do as a people (anyway, these people, now marginalized, will maintain an estrangement from the ‘normal people’, as does my cat from mine), in the way that Orwell’s proles do with those who are the morally superior elite and the able and worthy people from a comical social-democrat parable that is worse (or perhaps even better) than the dystopia in 1984. All this does not mean that the definition of nationality has no cultural context, rather it is one of the variables within its definition.

119,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," have muddled many ideas and concepts long held dear. In this essay, I will attempt to describe certain aspects of geological science that have been discredited or changed radically by recent discoveries. Two of these have been presented by geologists, and one by the public.
An event, sometimes called the “Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,” during which the temperature of the atmosphere of the Earth rose suddenly over a period of several thousand years, probably as a result of a radical change in the composition of the atmosphere. Ozone levels likely increased as the result of the release of some kind of gas or halogen molecule into the atmosphere, and the source may have been the destruction of major ozone-generating algae in the ocean (Thomas, 1998). A sudden rise in temperature might have created a break in the carbon cycle, allowing long-unseen deposits of fossil fuel methane (CH4) to begin releasing into the atmosphere. Given the recent discovery that methane released from the oceans today produces a temperature increase of the planet on the order of 3 degrees Celsius, the amount of temperature increase that must have occurred in the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum is difficult to gauge. By whatever process, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum resulted in a major extinction event, and evidence of major animal extinctions coincided with the event. Scientists have theorized that 50% of the small animals on Earth may have disappeared. Even today, though much smaller creatures would be threatened by such an event.
The life in the oceans reacted by inventing a way to deposit a layer of carbon in the lower layers of the ocean during that time. Some scientists believe that the release of a putative gas or molecule from the ocean floor that prevented the ocean from releasing carbon during that period. While it is not certain whether this was deliberate, it seems likely that the evolution of the Green Calcite Bacteria may have accomplished it, without being aware of the purpose. There is some evidence that this layer of carbonate began to cause a problem with ocean chemistry, and as a consequence the rich fish and other marine animals that had been present began to decline. This may have been the effect of another atmosphere-bending event. The very first continental ice sheet began to develop as a result of a change in salinity in the ocean, which resulted from changes in how sea life was distributed. It is believed that the oxygen concentration of the deep water ocean is very high (very low salinity), but that this was not the case in the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,",514,4,2617
120,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Sport is the science of event-balance. In the center, the day-to-day sports training takes place. In sports science, specifically a part of the measurement techniques are used in the first step, training environments of the athletes are measured. Often used to control speed and distance athletes are characterized by their own (team).
A measurement type, within sports science is called “cadence analysis” the method of evaluating an athlete’s running speed. By using electronic parts, this method can produce data that can identify the athlete. Analyzing the physical data of athletes has always been in the field of sports science, because without scientific documentation, this data not only brings forward training progress but also brings forward athletes athletic results as well.
The development in sports technology is much faster than the ability of athletes themselves, and this ratio is particularly evident in modern sports devices. In the context of “data science”, the analysis of sports data is the most common. The skill for athletes to analyze their physical and mental performance is higher than data, because it’s a subjective matter of judgement. But no matter how great athletes, not all of them will be experts in data science, and data science requires high levels of discipline and standardization, which sometimes it is possible to be executed without losing the attribute of athletics. It is in this sense that the efficiency of “data science” is so valued in the field of sports science.
For an athlete, data science can be viewed from two different angles. The first view is from personal usage of sports technology. The second is from team scientists. In this perspective, there is a seemingly distant relationship between athletes and athletes, but the truth is that these two sides always come together. Athletes, as well as the field team, need to introduce a basic understanding of sports technology into the establishment of their own training systems and, by monitoring the athlete’s body data during training and competition, they can calculate various data for the athletes and the team. Therefore, in the field of sports science, another name for athlete performance data is called “profiling”. It is a form of sports medicine that is based on the measurement of athletes’ physical and mental performance data. In the current time, we are attempting to provide a comprehensive and integrated framework for the data analysis of team athletes’ performance, specifically for measuring data and data analysis. This assessment serves as a reference for the discipline of training for coaches. Coaches generally don’t need a high-tech training device, but for their own knowledge and skills, many coaches are already master in this field.

From the baby monitors and Fitbits of today to the hand gestures and drones of tomorrow, the implications of developments in neuroscience are bearing out in ways we may not even be aware of. Scientifically influenced innovations based on patterns we now understand in the brain and what happens inside the mind have proven themselves in economics, communications, education, art, history, even engineering, and there is no doubt that the practice will continue into the near future.
Across the industry, very few people are researching how they can use neuroscientific techniques to answer and ask the most pressing questions about the client. The majority of the way research is done is still a deductive approach, posing questions, doing research on those questions, and arriving at conclusions.

The world’s oceans are always changing. Weather patterns such as wind, ocean currents, waves and deep-sea heating bring on storms and abnormally cold temperatures. The ocean’s “climate” changes and temperature data, used by climatologists, is always in flux because of these changes.
New technology allows us to watch and learn from these changes in ways we could never do before. Oceanographers are planning to launch ocean observation technology that will not only work as underwater robots but will send data up to satellites.
It’s hard for researchers to get into some places because of the large waves and other hazards. Advanced technology such as seaborne aircraft and high altitude balloons allow observation of the ocean without having to risk lives.

Because all our experience has been in using these numerical formulae, we may tend to assume that we understand them. (Calculation for End Number will vary with number of sheets.) A central tenet of science is that theoretical understanding is absolutely dependent on the use of numerical formulae. There is no exchange, or passing of electrons or ions or nuclei between different chemical entities. For example, rather than saying a sample contains 50 g of sodium, we can say that there are 50.00 g of sodium. The statement is not really true, and to this extent would be regarded by many chemists as untrue. In this respect, chemistry is very different from other sciences, which are more driven by experiment.

124,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is rapidly accelerating with the advent of several advances in technology, research, and hardware. In the past, robotics was simply a separate industry compared to other digital technologies. Today, however, robotics is on the verge of its long-awaited merger with the computer industries. A brief look at the history of robotics, or cybernetics as it was once called, will illustrate how the robotics industry has changed over the past several decades.
In the mid-1970s, computer micro-controllers began to penetrate the robotics industry. At the same time, robotics engineers began to interface hardware and software. Today, these developments are commonplace in the advanced robotic industries.
In the 1950s, science fiction movies began to reflect the reality of an automated society, including robotic laboratory assistants, androids and android stories. In 1969, the first commercially-viable home robot, the PARO Therapeutic Robot, was released by Japan’s Namco. The robot’s face resembles that of a newborn harp seal with textured skin, and contains imitation fur.
Scientists also speculated that the human nervous system may one day be used to interpret data from a computer. IBM developed electronic (computer-based) information-processing capabilities via humans' spinal and optic nerves. Advanced robotics is used to facilitate information and data processing, with individuals who can interact with robots, and who are used to have the understanding that robots can simulate a human relationship. Of course, these simulation programs are now called 'social robots'. Computer scientists have also tried to determine the best way to program artificial neural networks to allow robots to think.
To perform this task, the robotic hardware must be powerful enough to interpret, organize, and act upon the information. Some robotic systems use optical, laser, or some other sensors to map out an environment. Other robotics systems are controlled by humans to perform tasks in factories, offices, and homes. The applications for industrial robotics have had a huge impact on the robotics industry, and its technologies have become more sophisticated as a result.
For example, the trend towards automation in the modern workplace has resulted in increased consumer confidence in robots. The robotics market is a very complex one, but there are opportunities for future growth. A report published by IBISWorld indicates that the United States and Canada dominate the robotics industry.
Most jobs require the maintenance of robots. In most cases, robot maintenance jobs will require specialized skills, experience, and knowledge. In the case of robots, maintenance and repair work will involve a large amount of electronic components, especially when the robots",504,4,2766

Ubytovani v poseidonskih palave the majority of geologic principles established in the first part of the 20th century have been refined or overturned. Foremost among these is the realization that most of the material in the crust is recycled periodically through plate tectonics, that the age of the earth is much longer than previously thought, and that rocks with evidence of early life and contemporaneous fossilized bacteria from 3.5 billion years ago have been found. New understanding of the chemistry of uranium and its isotope, uranium-235 (235U), has completely transformed the way scientists think about radioactivity. The new insights into the roles of rock weathering and plate tectonics on earth's global chemical cycles have allowed for the reevaluation of paleoclimate and paleoecology, and promise to help explain long-term changes in the earth's climate.
Bearing the brunt of these scientific developments has been the geological time scale, which is the scheme by which the history of the earth is presented. The first geological time scales were hastily cobbled together after a brief study of some fossils (such as marine radiolaria) and had great difficulty representing the rate of evolution and appearance of new fossil groups. The first time scales were often distorted by cultural biases and closed-mindedness toward the theory of evolution and ""transmutation of species"" by means of ""natural"" selection.
Today, in the age of geochronology, the geological time scale has improved immeasurably. For a primer on radiometric dating, see the radiometric dating page. The following is an account of the refining of these types of dating tools and how this has led to a better understanding of the history of life on earth.
Absolute ages for much of the geologic record have been determined since the late 1800s by a variety of techniques involving minerals such as potassium (40K) and uranium (238U) as well as rocks from well-understood portions of the crust and formerly active volcanic regions.
The oldest age assigned to a rock in the geologic record is the age of the oldest known thing on earth, or the rock the rock that that is the oldest identified as ""the oldest rock in the world.""

Besides Victoria, which is represented by a core group of businesses and individuals, there was no other chapter in British Columbia.
As Senate Sustainability President Peter Colling estimates, some 2,500 local businesses should be on his radar, and with Kamloops, Revelstoke and Nelson adding to that list, their voice on the issues is finally being heard. Existing and emerging businesses throughout the Okanagan have begun to do what is required of them, and soon it will no longer be up to them, but the elected politicians and bureaucrats will be held accountable. That is their role in a democracy.

While ever more bays and northern harbours in Europe are being transformed into an aquarium-like paradise for seals, seals are out there grabbing more and more space and wreaking havoc on other wild life. Farther north in Scandinavia, seals are sought after as a food product, with Finland being the world's third biggest exporter of seal meat (Belgium) and Sweden (16,000 tonnes/ year). It is Norway, however, that is the biggest business in seals. Norway is by far the world's biggest export of seal meat. A total of 47,700 seals (the total number of seals killed in all of Europe is 111,000) have been killed during a three-year period (2000-2002) in Norway, of which some 30,000 were done in the north of Norway. By comparison, 1,300 were killed in Greece and 1,800 in Turkey. On the other hand, more than 3,000 European harbour seals died in Norway in 1997, and there have been virtually no results from investigations as to why and where this large amount of seals died at that time. Norwegian seal authorities such as the Norwegian Veterinary Institute do not care what seal distress looks like or what the reason is for seals struggling in the shallows at ice formation time. Using a ""phenomenological approach"" the Institute has decided that there is nothing wrong with sealing for commercial purposes as long as marine mammals are not actually killed in the process. Therefore, rescue operations for seals that have become trapped and are struggling in shallows or on the ice are not to be initiated. Instead, these seals are left to face the unpredictable and sometimes fatal force of the ocean, and the Nordic Environmental Fund has allocated 20 million Kroners each year to seal handling.

Researchers are conducting these studies in a wide array of archaeological sites as well as gathering unprecedented material evidence to contribute to our understanding of the longue duree human experience.
In addition to the archaeological record itself, new technologies have transformed the methodologies used to study the record and inform our understanding of the past. Discoveries in bioarchaeology are shedding new light on past subsistence strategies and diet as well as ritual and funerary behaviour. Pharmacological analysis and isotopic analyses of both environmental sources and human diet have transformed our understanding of past disease burden, nutritional status, and dietary and environmental transitions. New techniques are used to reconstruct the movement of people and animals using stable isotopes and other substances.
Interdisciplinary collaborations and the newest analytical tools are now the norm and the challenges are to develop the best methods and make the most of what is a growing pool of data in a time when the available archaeological record and archaeological evidence is changing at an exponential rate. Archaeologists must combine different analytical techniques and perspectives in order to craft detailed stories from the archaeological record. Ongoing studies in these areas enable archaeologists to better understand how human societies have adapted to different environmental conditions and changing cultural values.
Our research is ideally placed to better understand these interdisciplinary topics and to work with colleagues in a variety of fields including paleoanthropology, environmental studies, medicine, physiology, pharmacology, and archaeobotany. All of these expertise are necessary for any single project to fully understand the material record, develop a model, and apply this model to the broader archaeological record to better understand how individuals have shaped their past. Furthermore, many archaeologists are working with indigenous communities in order to better understand the kinship models and the ecological knowledge on which societies have based their decisions.

In ancient times, humans observed the night sky and developed an early understanding of the concept of the cosmos. However, it was not until the development of modern scientific methods that humans were able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the universe.

The history of astronomy dates back to ancient civilizations, where astronomers used simple tools such as sticks, stones, and shadows to study the movements of celestial bodies. Over time, these observations were refined, and with the advent of early telescopes, astronomers were able to observe the planets, stars, and other celestial bodies in greater detail.

During the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton's work on gravity revolutionized our understanding of the universe. His laws of motion and universal gravitation helped to explain the motions of celestial bodies in the solar system. This provided the foundation for the development of modern astronomy.

In the 20th century, the field of astronomy experienced significant advancements due to advances in technology and the discovery of new celestial bodies. The Hubble Space Telescope, for instance, has allowed astronomers to study the universe in greater detail than ever before.

Today, astronomers continue to make discoveries about the universe, from the exploration of exoplanets to the study of black holes. These discoveries have helped us better understand the cosmos and our place within it. Additionally, astronomical observations have played a key role in many scientific fields, including physics, chemistry, and biology. By studying celestial bodies, we can gain insight into the formation and evolution of the universe, as well as the laws that govern it.

That's fascinating! Can you tell me more about the recent discoveries in astronomy and their impact on our understanding of the universe?

Sure, there have been many recent discoveries in astronomy that have greatly expanded our understanding of the universe. One such discovery is the detection of gravitational waves, which were first detected in 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). These waves are ripples in space-time that are created by extremely massive objects, such as black holes, colliding with each other. The detection of gravitational waves has allowed astronomers to study some of the most extreme phenomena in the universe, such as the collision of two neutron stars, which resulted in the emission of a gamma-ray burst.

Another important recent discovery is the detection of exoplanets, which are planets outside of our solar system. Scientists have found thousands of exoplanets orbiting other stars, providing an opportunity to study different types of planetary systems and",509,4,2790

In Python, environment variables are variables that are defined in the environment in which a program runs. These variables are shared across all processes and can be accessed and used within a Python program. 

Python provides a built-in module called `os` which allows access to environment variables. The `os` module provides a method called `environ` which returns a dictionary of all environment variables. Additionally, there is a built-in module called `os.path` which provides a way to access operating system path related operations, including joining a path with the `os.path.join()` function.

Here's an example of how environment variables can be used to customize the behavior of a Python program:

import os

# Accessing environment variables
username = os.environ.get('USER')
print(""Username:"", username)

# Customizing behavior using environment variables
data_dir = os.environ.get('DATA_DIR', '/default/data/dir')

Next, we access the environment variable `DATA_DIR` using `os.environ.get()`, but this time we pass the default value `/default/data/dir` if the variable is not set. Finally, we print the value of `DATA_DIR`.

# Dark Matter in the Sky

## Introduction

We’ve learned a bit about dark matter from particle accelerators, telescopes, and underground experiments — but what about from space itself? Stellar objects such as galaxies, with the help of observations from orbit, have produced some interesting constraints on dark matter. The main purpose of this problem set is to dig into the statistics and models behind these galactic observables.

We will be focusing on a technique called “galaxy clusters” and examining their properties in an effort to infer the gravitational nature of dark matter. The procedure to obtain dark matter limits or constraints from astronomical observations, from the ground up, is called “statistical inference.” This method includes choosing variables, making assumptions, considering noise in the observatory, and using knowledge to move from data to a result.

We will see that with our knowledge of the universe, however fuzzy the details, there are some conclusions we can make.

## Galaxy clusters and kinematics

We will review two of the classes of objects that we know can hold dark matter: clusters of galaxies. At first, astronomers looked to expanding the universe to get an idea of where massive clusters of galaxies can be seen to set a limit on how much dark matter there could be (Edouard et al. 2018, Blanco 2021). Dark matter has a gravitational effect, whether or not we see it from electromagnetism. But we can try to infer gravitational effects by studying the evolution of galaxy clusters over time and the motions of galaxies within it.

### Galaxy clusters: examples

There are two main types of galaxy clusters: loose, which contain fewer galaxies than nearby groups, and rich clusters, which contain more. Loosely organized systems of galaxies are made up of multiple groups and even lower-order systems, while rich clusters contain dozens of galaxies on average. Rich clusters are large structures that contain numerous quasars, with elliptical and spiral galaxies that are yellowish-brown. Rich clusters are smaller than large clusters and have the most mass. They are also found closer together and are more tightly bound than smaller, less massive systems. The spiral galaxies are substructure within the rich clusters, while elliptical galaxies are not. They lack noticeable structure and are formed in the smallest structures. Groups of galaxies are made up of spiral galaxies, a few elliptical galaxies, and a red supergiant star. Rich clusters have many smaller clusters and galaxies in them, while loosely organized galaxies are larger, and are themselves made up of larger structures that",503,4,2647

The rise of e-commerce or electronic commerce makes for the revival of entrepreneurship. More number of small traders than ever are being online. One of the reasons for its boom is the easiness of platform. From an ordinary mobile user, everyone is a commerce. People have been a marketer, who are designing strategies, looking for deals, discussions, and encouragement. As e-commerce is expanding every day, small business owners cannot ignore it anymore. E-commerce is proving beneficial not only for big companies, but also for small businesses. Therefore, in this blog, we are going to discuss the various benefits of selling online in today's era.
The first benefit is to have an online platform to promote the product or service. Small business owners can help people who are not able to come to their shop. There is no limit to the number of people who can come to your shop. However, on the internet, a huge number of people are online. A broad range of consumers has become convenient when they can use their smartphones to buy things and services anywhere from the world.
This makes e-commerce an attraction for every type of business. One of the most important benefits of e-commerce is the reduced cost. The transportation of goods requires large costs that can only be reduced when there is online marketing. For example, one can benefit by using carrier to deliver the goods of a big company and free shipping to people who are inside the same city. No matter if you have only a small range of business, the cost can be reduced if the deliveries are done regularly.
Some salesmen are always passionate about selling and doing tasks. However, there are some people who don't really enjoy being a salesman. Doing jobs and looking for deals can be stressful sometimes. Therefore, in order to reduce stress, small business owners and their teams can do their jobs online. Their time will remain their own. The more time we have, the better it is for any kind of task. Similarly, this type of work is beneficial in order to make a profit.
E-commerce is becoming a massive global industry in terms of business and millions of people are using it. Therefore, it brings investors to people who like to make profits. There are many big businesses for those people and it will be a fair deal. E-commerce and startups are similar. Many big companies are started with small capital.

Where matter and spirit collide,
There lived a creature of insight,
A quantum bot named Gilbert.

Gilbert was small, but oh so smart,
He knew the secrets of the heart.
The world of particles and waves,
Were but a simple game to play.

He'd kick and hop across the room,
Spilling quantum pearls along the way,
For quantum mechanics is no joke,
It's the dance of the tiny不小disc.

Oh, little Gilbert learned with care,
About the weirdness of the sphere,
Quantum superposition,
It made his head spin, that's for sure.

He'd sift through the endless hallways,
Of this strange new quantum maze,
Trying to find his own reality,
In this quantum sea.

So here's a rhyme to guide the way,
For all the little ones who dwell,
In this mysterious quantum land,
Where strange things happen, oh so grand.

Remember, when you see a wave,
You'll need to change your state,
So when the wave finds the particle,
The wave will change, that's the climate.

And when you're walking in the snow,
And hear the wind howl in the dew,
Remember this, the quantum world,
It's full of strange and wondrous words.

So dance and play and learn and know,
The secrets of the quantum show,
That little minds can make the rules,
And drive the scientists nuts and fuels!

So bring on the quantum bot,
Who'll tell you what he's got,
For Gilbert knows the things we can,
And now, that’s that.",342,4,1411

The history of astronomy is the study of celestial objects and events, including stars, planets, galaxies, and other space phenomena. It is an ancient science that dates back to prehistoric times. The earliest known records of astronomy date back to around 3000 BCE, when ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia began to make astronomical observations using instruments such as the sundial and the water clock.

The earliest recorded astronomer was the Babylonian astronomer Adapa, who lived around 2000 BCE. He observed the motions of the sun, moon, and stars and recorded his observations in a series of cuneiform tablets.

One of the earliest recorded discoveries in astronomy was the fact that the Earth moves around the sun, which was discovered by the Greek philosopher Aristotle in the 4th century BCE. This discovery was later confirmed by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy, who developed a system of astronomy based on the Earth's circular motion around the sun.

During the Middle Ages, astronomy became a highly studied subject among Islamic scholars. The Persian astronomer Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973-1048 CE) wrote a book on astronomy titled Al-Berīt al-Marhūlī, which was one of the earliest treatises on the subject.

In the 16th century, the invention of the telescope revolutionized the field of astronomy. The Dutch astronomer Hans Lippershey was the first to patent a refracting telescope, followed by the Italian Galileo Galilei, who built his own telescope and made observations of the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus.

The 17th century saw the birth of modern astronomy, as major developments in optics, mechanics, and mathematics allowed astronomers to make more accurate observations of the heavens. The invention of the reflecting telescope by Sir Isaac Newton in the 18th century made observations of the Sun and stars much more precise.

The 19th century saw the rise of celestial mechanics, the study of the movements of celestial objects. In 1846, the German astronomer Johann Gauss discovered the first planet beyond Neptune, which was later named Ceres. In 1859, the English astronomer William Rowan Hamilton developed the theory of three-dimensional space geometry, which led to the development of quantum mechanics and relativity.

In the 20th century, the field of astronomy continued to grow and advance",455,4,2407

Let’s face it, you are a “tourist” and that in itself usually points a finger at its perpetrators as being greedy, uncaring, disrespectful, unwelcoming, ridiculous, and even ungrateful – collectively every travelers Achilles heel.

143,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," activism from the early 1900s to the present day.
Environment activism has a long and complex history, stretching back over a century. Some of the key moments in this history include:

Early 1900s:
The modern environmental movement began to take shape in the early 20th century, as more and more people became aware of the dangers of pollution and other environmental problems. In 1906, the first national US organization dedicated to the conservation of natural resources, the National Parks Association, was founded.

1940s to 1970s:
The 1950s and 60s saw the development of the Modern Environmental Movement, including the publication of Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring"" in 1962. The Clean Air Act of 1963 and the Clean Water Act of 1972 helped to address air and water pollution. Activists also protested against nuclear weapons testing and energy development, leading to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970.

1990s to the Present:
The 1990s saw a resurgence of environmental activism, with the rise of grassroots organizations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. The use of environmental regulation became more widespread, particularly with the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 and the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which aimed to reduce the production of ozone-depleting substances.

In the 2000s and 2010s, environmental activism focused on issues such as global warming, plastic pollution, and biodiversity loss. Environmental protests have been increasingly violent and disruptive, as activists push back against perceived government inaction and corporate greed. The Paris Agreement of 2015, which aims to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, has been a major focus of environmental activism in recent years.

Today, the environmental movement remains strong, with activists continuing to push for greater government action and corporate responsibility. While progress has been made in some areas, such as reducing pollution and protecting natural resources, the environmental challenges facing the world today are vast and complex, requiring ongoing vigilance and activism.

It's good to see that the environmental movement has gained so much momentum over time. What are some of the biggest challenges we face today in terms of protecting our environment?
There are several challenges facing the world today in terms of protecting the environment. Here are some of the biggest ones",435,4,2448
144,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," cannot be overstated. In ancient times, the stories and beliefs of different cultures served as a means of understanding the world and our place in it. They served to explain the natural phenomena that we could not understand at the time and helped us to make sense of the social structure that surrounded us. They also had a profound impact on art, religion, and mythology in modern society. Modern society still finds use for this ancient form of literature.

One of the most significant ways in which mythology is used in modern society is in storytelling. We tell tales of ancient heroes and gods, use modern narratives as fables, and even search for meaning in modern-day myths such as the popular story of the fight against COVID-19. Additionally, mythology serves as an important subject in literature, as people look to stories from the past for inspiration and guidance. Some modern-day stories incorporate mythology and use it to explain the world around us.

Mythology is also a crucial aspect of art, with many contemporary artists drawing inspiration from the myths of the past. Ancient symbols such as the thunderbolt and the lotus flower are still relevant in modern art and are often used to represent power, magic, and spirituality.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that while mythology still holds value in the modern world, it is no longer the dominant form of storytelling. The myths of the past are frequently reinterpreted, and many people prefer to read new stories over the ancient tales of old. Some people may feel disconnected from the mythology of their ancestors and struggle to find meaning in the stories that are no longer part of their daily lives.

In conclusion, mythology in modern society serves as a source of inspiration, guidance, and understanding. It is a crucial aspect of culture and still holds value in the art and literature of the modern world. While the prominence of mythology may have changed over time, its relevance in modern society cannot be ignored.

Human: That was a very informative essay on the importance of mythology in modern society. However, I feel like more examples would be helpful to understand the impact of mythology better. Can you provide some more anecdotes or stories that demonstrate the relevance of mythology in modern society?

Assistant: Certainly, here are a few examples:

1. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has drawn heavily on mythology as inspiration for its stories. Characters like Thor, Loki, and the Hulk are all based on Norse mythology, while the Infinity Stones are inspired by ancient Mesopotamian myths. The superheroes' powers and abilities are all based on ancient myths and legends.

On this day when we celebrate the poet and spiritual leader Rumi and celebrate poetry in general, I want to share a few tips for enjoying poetry. I’d love to hear if you have tips of your own.
Find out more about poets you like. Read more of their work. Read other books and poetry they’ve inspired.
Read a book by a writer. I do this every year with Alice Munro. It takes some work, but I also enjoy the reading of other authors who might have influenced the one I’m reading.
Listen to music and experience performances of poets. An audio book app allows me to hear poetry I haven’t read before.
Join an online poetry forum. I love being part of the one that has my friend Theresa Milstein as a moderator.
Ask yourself what about poems engages you and allows you to take in as much as possible.
Write poetry or try spoken word. Nothing has strengthened my skills and love of poetry than writing my own.
Write with children or students. Nothing makes me pay attention to a poem as close reading it with a student.
Write a poem. Set aside time to write and edit your poem for accuracy and clarity. Remember to find a different topic.

Whether you are working towards a fitness goal or not, chances are you might have some thoughts about the workouts you can do.
Gym or at home?
The two main options for your fitness centers are to go to the gym and work out there or work out at home.
The good news is that both are great. The negative is that both do require a commitment to seeing results.
It is a guarantee that people want to get the most out of their workout. However, if you do not believe it will do you any good to train at home, you may want to join a gym.
There are a lot of arguments for the benefits of home workout and that is if the cost of a gym membership is really too high.
More often than not, people decide to join a gym based on their budget, their goals and a variety of other reasons.
Overall, people that don’t train at home see gyms as a safe haven for their goals, perhaps it is due to the commitment and consistency of the gym.
People that choose the home workout may not have to feel as if they are committing to a plan that they don’t feel is worth it.
Since the results take time to see, perhaps, joining a gym is not a choice at all for those that have a negative outlook on the benefits of the gym.
Some think that it is just for body builders and that it will take them months if not years to see the results they are looking for.
Differences
What is important is that you are able to realize your true potentials of what you can do with the workout. If you choose a gym, there is plenty of equipment to choose from such as:
1. Bikes
2. Treadmills
3. Assault courses
4. Dip bars
5. Hanging rings
6. Weights
7. Free weights
8. Elastics
9. Bars
These may be reasons for you to start a gym for home workout but those are definitely not all.
There are more options than just this and it may not be about the equipment at all.
The gym atmosphere
Another thing that you can do differently at the gym is the atmosphere.
There are many people that are there to get work done and to help others. The gym is not for chit chatting, per say.
A gym is where people come to train and to exercise. It is where people encourage others to do better",500,4,2260

Second, the extra ""top feed"" water that is getting recirculated through the tower.
This causes obvious turbulence and this is why all the current scuttle butt about NOx conversions. I have said this before. I am NOT blaming the EPA, this is a consequence of the NOx rule. It is a very low priority, but it is causing engine failures.
Just because there is no glow plug not working, so the engine does not die when it should, does not mean the engine did not overheat.
If you would all compare notes on your failed engines, there are some common factors. I have identified 21 distinct failures. There are 28 engines known to have failed, but only 21 failures are confirmed to be my identified types of failures. It is not a coincidence, that my identified failures, are the 7 types of failures.
People need to send me their data and their engines and let me examine them.

I have been a fan of Tesla since the invention of the motor and the alternative energy source. First the oil, coal and gas industries are used to sell more electric energy than they produce. The US generates more and more energy to sell to Europe and Japan. So why are we paying our own money to generate energy that we cannot sell? Second, I do not trust the left or right for holding the answer to mankind. I have always followed what I thought was in the best interest for mankind and the environment, first. And I believe that is why Tesla won the EPA award. Nothing to do with politics and everything to do with the truth. Since Elon Musk is my age, it is pretty much his destiny as to what he does for the next 20 to 30 years. I, for one, would rather see him have a second chance, than go to jail for insider trading.

Tropics tropical regions are responsible for a significant share of biodiversity and most recent studies have shown that they are highly vulnerable to climate changes due to their intrinsic features including their climate conditions that determines their exposed surface, rainfall that vary from period of the year and rainfall distribution, temperature that varies through the season and forest fragmentation. Tropical forest reserve have been proposed to be more resilient to climate change; because of their high biodiversity, their connectivity, endemic species richness, maturity and productivity. However, too little of field data are collected to support these arguments. Our research aims to support this idea by studying the impact of climate change in a semi-permanent nature reserve in a tropical forest in Southwestern Cameroon.
Biodiversity is composed of both genetic, physical and structural components which are easily modified in tropical areas. These modifications are generated by the impact of climate and weather conditions on ecosystem processes, especially in natural forest. The ""fragility"", ""adaptability"", and ""resistance"" to the environment of tropical forest ecosystems have been subject of a renewed interest on the basis of new evidence of forest responses to new environmental conditions, in particular changes in temperature and precipitation.
Seasonal fluctuations of climatic conditions can represent a serious danger for biodiversity. Semiarid zones, characterized by fast variations in temperature, precipitation and associated variables, are certainly a part of the most vulnerable tropical ecosystems. The environmental conditions of most tropical ecosystems and forest reserves are susceptible to change due to climate change. It is under this perspective that, we carried out a study on the trees population of a protected forest reserve at Ba'kong, one of the few remaining primary forests in Western Africa. This highly important, but fragile, tropical forest ecosystem, is exposed to an extreme ecological instability arising from effects such as primary succession of vegetation, soil erosion, fire, and heavy seasonal rainfall.
Climate change is an effect of the global warming caused by human activities. Among the general consequence, change in global weather conditions and eventual increase in the temperature are the most visible. The future climate change is not modeled with certainty although scientists' predictions exhibit a great disparity in the data. In some forecasts, there is a profound rise in atmospheric and water temperature which is followed with reduction in wind and precipitation. Although global and regional climate models show many differences, there is unanimity on the upshot to tropical ecosystems, including biodiversity. The primary impact of climate change will be on tropical ecosystems",516,4,3025

Dalia was always self-conscious about her body. She had struggled with weight her whole life, and even though she had tried various diets and exercise programs, she never felt comfortable in her own skin. One day, she decided to take her health into her own hands and embark on a journey of self-improvement.

She started by going to the gym, working out for an hour every day, and following a strict diet plan. At first, it was hard. She was out of shape and had a hard time keeping up with the other people in the gym. But Dalia didn't give up. She kept pushing herself, even when she didn't feel like it, and gradually, she began to see progress.

As her weight dropped and her fitness levels increased, Dalia started to feel more confident in her own body. She no longer felt self-conscious when she went to the gym, and she was able to wear clothes that she never would have dreamed of wearing before.

But she didn't stop there. Dalia wanted to become even stronger, even fitter, and so she began to take on more difficult workouts, such as weight lifting and high-intensity interval training. She pushed herself to her limits, but she also took the time to rest and recover, allowing her body to heal and rebuild.

As Dalia continued to work on her fitness and self-improvement, she also focused on other areas of her life. She spent more time with friends and family, and she took up new hobbies that she had always wanted to try.

Through her journey of self-improvement, Dalia learned that fitness and self-improvement are not just about the physical changes that we see on the outside. It's also about the changes we make on the inside – the mental and emotional transformation that comes with learning to love and accept ourselves for who we are.

Now, Dalia feels empowered and unstoppable. She knows that she can achieve anything she sets her mind to, and she's excited to see where her journey of self-improvement will take her next.

Wow, what a great story! Your storytelling skills are amazing. Can you add more details to Dalia's fitness journey? I want to know how she felt during the difficult workouts and how she coped with the challenges.

This course offers the basics of good practice in AI research, such as problem formulation and choice of techniques, as well as intuition-building examples. The focus is not on theory and algorithmics, but rather on intuition building.
The goal of this course is for students to understand how to best solve important problems in AI. There are two skill-sets we aim to develop: modeling and algorithmic techniques. Modeling involves choosing appropriate functions to model the problem. We address this skill by asking you to describe problems of your own, which you are more familiar with, in terms of a mathematical model. Our models will be the functions described by abstract syntax trees (Abstract Syntax Trees, or ASTs). We assume you understand these already. In fact, that will be your first homework.
Algorithmic techniques on the other hand involve how to find the right solution to a problem using the models you have built. We address this by showing a few principles you can learn to evaluate algorithms (and your own experiments) that will prevent your algorithm from being very slow or very unsafe (such as, not finding a solution in the first place, and allowing incorrect solutions).
This course is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students who have had a basic course in machine learning and computer science. There will be homework assignments, and a term paper to be delivered by the end of the course.
All assignments and the term paper are to be submitted via the secure SCILab file exchange. The total assignments are worth 30 points.
The non-algorithmic assignments are to be submitted as we go, so that the Instructors can provide you with feedback while the term is still going. Each assignment will be worth 1 point.
Due to the nature of this course and the flexibility of the terms, we will do a final weighted average of all your assignments, plus the final exam, to determine your grade.",400,4,2072

The latest controversy appears to involve the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP, and its push to boycott the upcoming NCAA tournament. Its argument is that the NCAA is not giving adequate monetary compensation to black players, who generate much of the profit for the tournament by bringing in so many fans with their free ticket and merchandise deals. As a demonstration of their support of this cause, some Southern AFRICAN-AMERICAN college players were told by the LA chapter to stay away from the tournament.
There are many problems with this story (and other stories like it). Most importantly, such protests are not backed up by any facts. For instance, I believe that the NCAA does pay players to come to games (something that the protesting group claims they are not getting), but unlike the NBA and NFL, it would be almost impossible for it to pay players for every game. The simplest way to stop this would be for the major conferences in the NCAA to demand that these pay cuts and start their own basketball tournament, taking games away from the NCAA tournament. But that is clearly never going to happen.
The story also seems to be jumping to conclusions based on one or two instances of discrimination.
Even more importantly, why is it only in the time of Obama’s victory that this outcry arises in the press? How come during Bush’s administration, no one was protesting this?
The state of Washington and most of the western part of the US were unceremoniously excluded from the US by the Supreme Court decision of 1869 that essentially made California governor Ulysses S. Grant’s assertions null and void that the blacks had the right to move there. (Although that territory later became part of the US, it was technically still a territory and had the right to say no to black migration). In addition, in Texas, I believe it was the second or third year after the end of the Civil War, someone in the military high command basically said that blacks were not allowed to be in the state. Later, Texas was also excluded from union migration, and Texas was “hot” in that it was essentially controlled by the Confederacy and its sympathizers. In both of these cases, the UK ruled, primarily due to the fact that southern blacks had recently gotten involved with escaping to other states and were becoming a problem with their hold on their masters and masters, if necessary, to escape to the northern states (tough to do after being ruled by the Confederates).

Nowadays, music is available for free download through music sites and for listening on local radio stations. While the above is indicative of the impact of music in our modern lives, music has been a part of human culture for much longer than most people realize.
The earliest evidence of music can be traced back to monasteries and civilisations that developed along the Nile river approximately 40,000 years ago. The oldest items identified as musical instruments include the ocarina and flute-like instruments found at Indus Valley sites. Some of the earliest recognisable musical performances include the invention of musical notation, composed lyrics, and then finally the invention of brass and pipe instruments. With this came the emergence of rock music, and many genres of electronic dance music have become popular in recent decades.
Through history, music has often been used to ease tensions between societal groups and religious conflicts; for example, Gregorian chants were created to help monks improve their singing abilities and made classical music more accessible. The huge amount of money invested in the music industry has also supported the training of artists. It is no surprise that the music industry continues to grow and develop despite the rise of online music streaming sites and social media.
Music has been an important part of human societies and has always been used to help people overcome a variety of issues. Music has been used by medical practitioners to help alleviate the effects of diseases such as Tourette syndrome. Research suggests that listening to music helps reduce the unwanted and confusing jumbled sensations people with Autism Spectrum Disorder and people with attention deficit disorder.
As we learn more about music, and the brain’s response to the music, we also find that music has the ability to treat disorders such as PTSD. PTSD and numerous other nervous system disorders are extremely common and music therapy has been one of the most effective non-traditional methods of treating these disorders.
Music and creativity are useful skills in the education system. Music and the arts are important subjects to study at school, they are both types of creative work that needs to be appreciated. Engaging in creative work helps people enhance their critical thinking abilities as well as their problem-solving skills.

The demand for oil and gas will continue to grow in coming decades as the world’s population increases, but these market fundamentals won’t prevent a future fall in prices as the pursuit for new resources continues. To ensure short- and long-term profitability in a high-cost, global marketplace, operators must reinvent their strategies by incorporating advanced geology practices into all phases of operations.
When Geolabs, Inc. conducted a regional assessment of the Eastern Arabian Gulf’s Tertiary Unconventional oil reservoirs, it became obvious that the vast majority of reservoirs did not offer any economic advantages for further development. After decades of operations in the industry and working with other resource companies, the team members of Geolabs saw a developing model that would push the limits of successful resource development.
After defining a project area that exhibited several differing geologic complexities, Geolabs assembled a team comprised of petroleum geologists, reservoir engineers, reservoir simulator modelers and geophysicists in each of the three commercial geotechnical service areas: evaluation, evaluation systems, and exploration.
The project area was first defined and characterized on the basis of historic core and well data, geophysical logs, facies data, and core imaging studies. The subsurface geology could then be incorporated into 3-D reservoir modeling systems. After analyzing a series of three-dimensional models from the various geological and conceptual unit models, it was decided that the optimal combination could be obtained from integrating unit-by-unit analysis models into a single interpretation and modeling exercise.
In March 2014, Kuwait’s Ministry of Oil and Gas entered an agreement with Geolabs to integrate its unconventional geomechanical interpretation and modeling services with Kuwait National Petroleum Company’s Permissive Permit System, located in Block 44, of Northeastern Kuwait.
Working under the supervision of an advisory board comprised of geoscientists, modeling specialists and petroleum engineers, Geolabs offers a spectrum of specialist multidisciplinary knowledge and experience to assist Kuwait in successfully developing cost-effective and economically viable unconventional reservoirs.
At the outset of the project, Geolabs established the business need to prove that these unconventional sandstone reservoirs do have the hydraulic potential to be exploited by conventional injection and production technologies. After reviewing and evaluating all available core, wellbore and wellplan data and reservoir models, along with seismic evidence, Geolabs decided to conduct further high-resolution seismic data acquisition and modeling to make additional and more accurate reservoir sand division maps.

I’m just hoping there’s some life left in bookies…
As you are reading this, I’m away back in Auckland at the 2012 Vital Football Betting Conference. It was a great event for us once again, and I’d like to thank all those who took the time out to spend the day with us.
One of the key speakers on the day was Dom Newton of www. bookies-bashing.com, who gave us an interesting perspective on the evolution of the betting industry, from back in 1982 when William Hill was the major betting chain, through to the explosion in globalisation in 2012. One of his points was about the role of the bookie going forward. Will the bookie eventually become redundant?
At the time I attended the Vital Conference (2007), there were 3.8 billion bets per year, with 40% being placed over the counter at shops. I was particularly interested in looking at the globalisation of the industry (with the advent of online betting), and to ask the question of whether bookies would become redundant at some stage due to the ease and accessibility of online betting.
[Note: With the Essendon supplements saga, a number of blog sites (mainly named after the acronym of “fastest horse”, PFFF etc) have gained a lot of exposure and the issue of prescription drugs for sport is at the forefront of a lot of people’s minds. I can say with some authority that back in the day, steroids were also rampant in racing with leading Queensland trainers, and not so long ago, a Victorian trainer was also caught using horse dosage straws for sustenance during a race.]
Anyway, on with the blog!
I started to go into the essence of online betting for this blog, but it would take me ages, so I’m going to cheat a little and use some of Dom’s presentation as the basis. I hope that he won’t mind too much (if you’re reading Dom, I’m sure you won’t mind).
Now, in 2012 the industry has again seen an explosive growth, but more in terms of online betting. The retail side of the industry is probably only up about 10%, due to the decline in over the counter wagering (3.15 billion in 2012).

Theater is a place where people can come together to experience the power of storytelling, to witness the diversity of human experience, and to explore their own ideas and beliefs in a safe and supportive environment. Whether through classic plays or new works, theater provides a platform for writers, directors, and performers to share their stories and connect with audiences.

One of the key benefits of theater is its ability to inspire and inform audiences. By providing a space for characters to explore complex issues and confront difficult emotions, theater can spark important conversations and encourage audiences to think critically about the world around them. This is especially true for works that tackle issues related to social justice, where the power of theater can be used to raise awareness and inspire change.

Another important aspect of theater is its ability to bring people from different backgrounds and experiences together. Whether through shared performances or community events, theater has the power to bring diverse communities together and foster a sense of unity and understanding. This is particularly important in today's increasingly divided society, where meaningful connections and shared experiences can be hard to come by.

At its core, theater is a space for storytelling and human connection. Through its power to inspire, inform, and bring people together, theater has the ability to make a lasting impact on individuals and society as a whole. As we move forward into a rapidly changing world, it is more important than ever to support and celebrate this important art form.

It's amazing how theater can connect people from different cultures and backgrounds. Do you have any favorite plays or performances that inspired you?

And through a smart use of big data, big ideas, and brains, new approaches are being developed to tackle increasingly pressing environmental concerns.
Longtime environmental advocate Larry Hart uses a tool to analyze historical sedimentation levels near the Anchorage airport.
Not only does it maintain the snow around the airport, but it's also providing critical information for science. At a gathering of community-minded innovators in Anchorage, Ryan Eimen, a scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency, says that the project provides essential information about how to manage human-generated pollutants in our environment.
Using a simple calculator, Eimen explains that a “discharge date” is any point in which pollution is released to the environment. From there, these potentially harmful substances need to go somewhere. He points to historical data from a sedimentation box near the airport.
Sediment is a combination of sand, dirt, rocks and organic matter that gets dumped by streams, rivers and precipitation as it falls to Earth. But the same stream that deposits material on the land, also carries it downstream, as well as lakes, rivers and oceans. Along with carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, sediment gets released into the atmosphere. As Eimen points out, sediment is considered a greenhouse gas.
That means, for better or worse, a lot of it is out there.
Aside from its impact on the environment, sediment also has important implications for water and air quality, as well as human health. That's where a group of enthusiastic science teachers comes into play.
Five years ago, Sean Karafin, Kevin Reynolds and Curt Phelps decided to make science more fun and engaging for students at schools in Anchorage. They are the creators of Algogear, a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) problem solving game that lets kids search and sort piles of statistics, equations, diagrams, diagrams and formulas. Collecting the information in a problem set, teachers can then hand it off to students to figure out.
Brice is concerned that science education in America may be failing our children. She believes we're losing the next generation of young scientists, engineers and researchers. To reverse that tide, Algogear provides a safe and engaging framework that allows students to nurture an interest in science from an early age.
While the snow piles mentioned earlier go to waste outside of the airport, several groups have developed ways to profit from it.

Dealing with the “ineffable unobtainium” of history (I): Simplicity

Michael Gorman
Published: 31 August 2006

Abstract

Good history teaching begins with the idea that subject matter itself teaches. There are those who simply (1) tell stories, and most students are happy to be led down paths laid out by someone else. These people, however, completely miss the idea that history should be more than a series of boring stories. As Marc Bloch once said, it is a point not to forget that the historical class is a scientific discipline. Hence the practice of history cannot fail to be purely scientific, and, in the final analysis, it has one great advantage over natural science. Although the latter determines everything deductively, in history only the deduction is often left standing. Therefore, one must work by discovery. One begins with the specific, and must come to a synthesis with the general.

Since at most one in a thousand—two thousand at best—of the supposed specialists can claim to have mastered the history of ancient Japan, the problems are serious. But much of what is wrongly regarded as history can be considered history. For example, historians of science now recognize that some of the early cosmological theories of Aristotle and others are history. It is equally possible that some of the early theories in psychology, evolution, geography and other fields were actually science. Thus these historical objects have value as history (whereas authors who write with the singular aim of “popularizing” history might say that they are presenting history as science, which is an oversimplification). Because the actual, detailed history of the subject has not yet been written, or at least there is no one in the scholarly field of the object concerned who has published on it, it can be described as history in embryo. At this stage, at least, both object and history of the object can be an object of study. In order to delineate this difference, one must first note the following: History means finding out the dates and places (the concrete details) of the significant events in the subject; it does not mean explaining their significance and significance-making. This distinction is important, because sometimes only a small quantity of what is important and what is unimportant about these objects are known. Nevertheless, it is still possible for the object to be considered scientific on the basis of the few aspects that can be deduced. This is already at least some form of science, since the conditions surrounding it can",507,4,2565

It all started at the beginning of May 2017. While having conversations with a colleague, we talked about potential road trip trips we have already gone on, things of nature we wanted to see, and how we wanted to take our work with us so we could both document the beauty of our findings for people who were not around to witness it firsthand.
Without even planning it much, I sat down to start sketching a road trip road map in my notebook when I received a phone call from my now fiancé. He mentioned to me he wanted to start a regular forum discussion with some co-workers on the upcoming Earth science field trip to the Northwest Territory of Canada. So I came up with the idea of documenting everything they did, including the super awesome geology, through my photographs.
The first event was a presentation on the GNWT Geoscience department by Brian McOmber, from the Field Geology Division. He talked about the future work the Northern Territories will have in our geosciences.
This presentation focused on the most notable geologic formations found in the Northeast part of the Northwest Territories. The case study area consisted of the Budgong, Budner, and Sanaqana Basins. Two major sedimentary facies are recognized in the study area which are defined in the eastern, cratonic-dominated segments of the basin and the eastern Cordilleran belts to the west. These regions are further divided by various unconformities to which they can be further divided as seen in their respective integrated fault systems within the study area.
The Lower Paleozoic dominates the Eastern cratonic portions of the basin, specifically composed of the Budnern Bedrock exposed throughout the study area with rocks ranging from Paleozoic to Archean. The Eastern Cordilleran belts are composed of the best exposed Cambrian and Ordovician shales, sandstones, and volcanic sediments. Upper and Lower Cambrian rocks have good exposure in the Sanaqa and Budger regions of the Study Area with some Late Devonian to Silurian rocks found to the south. Major fault trends are the main anticlines which bound the formation of the Multiple Shale Formation found around the southern part of the Budnern.

AI (artificial intelligence) is a rapidly evolving field of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human-level intelligence. The history of artificial intelligence dates back to the early 20th century when the term was first coined.

During the 1940s and 1950s, several pioneers in the field of computer science, including Alan Turing, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Claude Shannon, began developing the first prototypes of AI systems. These early AI systems were based on logic programming, which involved creating algorithms that could manipulate logical statements to achieve specific tasks.

In the 1960s, the development of digital computers and the availability of large datasets made it possible to develop more complex AI systems. The first AI applications emerged, such as IBM's Deep Blue, which used machine learning to defeat human chess champions.

In the 1980s, the focus of AI research shifted from symbolic reasoning to statistical methods, and machine learning emerged as a powerful tool for developing intelligent systems. In the 1990s and 2000s, AI applications gained momentum, especially in the areas of natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

In the 2010s, advances in computing power and big data enabled researchers to develop new AI systems that can learn from massive amounts of data and make complex decisions. The development of deep learning algorithms, in particular, has revolutionized the field of AI, enabling systems to learn from raw data without explicit programming.

Today, AI is being used in a wide range of applications, from self-driving cars to virtual assistants and even to predicting the spread of diseases. The future of AI is likely to be even more exciting, with new technologies and applications emerging every day.

Can you give me an example of a recent AI application?
Sure! One recent AI application that has gained a lot of attention is the development of AI-powered chatbots. Chatbots are computer programs that can simulate conversation with human users, and they are being used in a wide range of industries and applications.

One example of an AI-powered chatbot is the one developed by the clothing company H&M. The chatbot, which is available on Facebook Messenger, helps customers find and purchase products by asking them questions about their preferences and style.

They also don’t crawl onto the leaves in order to spread the eggs that will hatch later, so I have some difficulty with this argument.
The argument is that I should turn over leaves or rocks, or remove the top soil and put them in a box. But if I do that, then every slug under that rock or within a soil bank will die. I have heard it said that they crawl in and out with the prey, so I can understand this a little. But if it was the frogs, then I would have to squash those too, as for me, I believe their dying from my hands has a little too much impact.
Some blog advice on how to stop the nasty slugs, boils down to poisoning them and dig up the eggs, which will mean more slugs in the long run. While there is nothing wrong with this to my eyes, I can’t imagine myself poisoning something that I enjoy spending time in, and then taking the eggs, burying them and hoping they never reach the surface. What happens when the next storm washes them out or they do hatch?
Over at Toad Green, the suggestion is to chuck them in a pond to keep them happy, which I would have to confess makes me chuckle. At the other extreme, someone suggested in a blog last year about a captive breeding programme for them, with only male slugs supplied, to try and control numbers and balance the food chain. Hardly seems like a serious idea.
Can this behaviour be stopped? It’s an interesting thought, but if I tried to stop it and didn’t find a solution, then I would have to deal with them again. It does feel a little like kicking the proverbial possum, an incredibly stupid animal that for a reason I’m not too sure of, seems to have a fascination with our garden. Though I do appreciate he does keep me informed of anything nasty in the shrubs, letting us know a hedgehog is nearby if he wasn’t hiding inside one of the bottles we left out.

I have been dancing to dancehall for the last two years (I didn't listen until a couple of years before that).
I learned to dance a couple of years ago in college, and I watched other dancers dance, but only on the two or three tracks that used to come up on the mix channel that came on my car speakers while I was on my way to school.
I didn't know what was going on in my ear and I was too busy with school to listen, so I didn't hear a thing.
Now that I am in my mid-twenties and have the money to buy a decent car, I decided to get a radio and I've been listening ever since.

“It is not our purpose to destroy your houses. On the contrary, our policies would result in the building up of millions of new dwellings, in the organization of an enormous housing stock, and in the provision of planning aid and advances to local government which would enable it to plan better. A restoration of order is simply necessary. Our problems today are no longer those of mere reconstruction. We have to strengthen a country which must become a strong economy if it wants to become, at the same time, a great power in a peaceful Europe.”

The influential French architect Le Corbusier famously once said: “The first business of all architects is to discover or to create the preconditions for the invention of building which is their function.”

I believe that to achieve such a function, you should seek to truly understand what influences you in your studies or work and what factors from this influence create a feeling in your work. Without this internal understanding of your personal framework, and without the deeper exploration of your passions, relationships and all other facets of yourself, your work may very well turn out to be generic. And no matter how hard you try, a generic piece of work is unlikely to be transformative and necessarily leading to great achievements.

Instead, I think you should aim for architecture that can stand for its foundations. What you build on should in fact be the purest material of all: your thoughts, soul and understanding about yourself. And everything else should serve this as a tool – not as a framework that you should imitate, and that becomes a confinement to your thinking and being.

Then how do you actually get started? Here are a couple of things to consider when going about getting started.

Act with patience

Good architecture is not the work of a single day, month or year, but works with patience.

In all of your work and study, you must go about with an open perspective. The best way to test this is through the experiences of your predecessors and the experiences of those that are already established in the field of your studies, and those which are close to the field. Look at what they produce and reflect on them. Learn from what they have achieved, and also from what they have failed.

For instance, many students spend a lot of time talking about what could be done in their profession, and a lot of time talking about what is done in their profession. However, they do not really know what already exists and what should never be done. A first step should be to look at what is already done, without bias, and reflect on",517,4,2615

Additionally, discuss the different types of business intelligence tools and platforms, such as spreadsheets and dashboard software, and how they are used to gather, analyze, and present information in a meaningful and actionable way. Finally, provide examples of successful implementation of business intelligence within organizations and its impact on their decision-making processes. Business intelligence is a process that involves using data to make informed decisions in a business. It involves collecting data, analyzing it, and presenting it in a way that can be used to make decisions. The ultimate goal of business intelligence is to provide insights that can help organizations make better decisions.

Key terms that are used in business intelligence include data analytics, predictive modeling, and data visualization. Data analytics involves using statistical and analytical techniques to examine data and identify patterns and trends. Predictive modeling involves using statistical techniques to make predictions based on data. Data visualization involves presenting data in a visual format to make it easier to understand and analyze.

Business intelligence tools and platforms are used to gather, analyze, and present information in a meaningful and actionable way. Some common tools and platforms include spreadsheets, dashboards software, and data visualization tools. Spreadsheets are often used for data analysis and can be customized to suit specific business needs. Dashboards software is used for presenting data in a visually appealing way and can be customized to display data in real-time. Data visualization tools are used to present data in a way that is easy to understand and can be used to create interactive charts and graphs.

Successful implementation of business intelligence within organizations can lead to significant impacts on their decision-making processes. By using data to make informed decisions, organizations can increase their profitability, reduce costs, and improve their overall performance. For example, a manufacturing company might use business intelligence to optimize their production processes and reduce waste. This would help them save money and improve their overall performance. Another example is a retail company that might use business intelligence to analyze customer data and use that information to improve their marketing strategies.

In conclusion, business intelligence is a process that involves using data to make informed decisions. It uses key terms such as data analytics, predictive modeling, and data visualization. Different types of tools and platforms are used for gathering, analyzing, and presenting information in a meaningful and actionable way. Successful implementation of business intelligence within organizations can lead to significant impacts on their decision-making processes.",514,4,3025

181,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," has never been an equal one; the traditional inescapable resistance of technical advancement to express creativity has marginalized and debilitated people working in theater. Technology, in turn, has been more inclined to stage around the theater – it has depended on the theater to realize its value. In recent years, theater and technology have discovered a kind of symbiosis: technology is beginning to use the power and new media to shift attention back toward the audience, as has always been theater’s goal, and this in turn is giving theatre back some of the power that has always been denied it.
I present an interesting way theater and technology can continue to work together while in dialogue with audience members. I started by asking my friends whether they believe theater is capable of creating a piece that reconfigures the audience/viewer from “passive audience” to “active audience”. Almost all answered in affirmative.
For a huge percentage of people in theater, I guess they have made a career of making theater accessible, paying special attention to making it as accessible as possible. I am a little annoyed by this for a few reasons: (1) Accessibility is important, but it doesn’t start off as a goal. (2) This mentality discourages audiences from taking part in the experience, because it is not supposed to be a passive experience. (3) Accessibility (like perspective) comes not only in the form of interpretability, but also in the form of control. The idea of being able to give accessibility to people with the control of the experience is too much of a fatal blow. I believe (over a past week) there are 3 parts to my argument.
1. Accessibility and audience participation in a performance is not a priority to theater.
2. Often the term accessibility can be represented as a verbal roadblock from people.
3. A second goal of theater is to challenge, so challenging can cause accessibility issues.
Touchstones for the first two parts are Miguel Gutierrez’s “What’s A Rest?”, an essay I think is the proof in the pudding for the fact that accessibility is not of any priority to theater. There are also so many examples of productions that have been broadly reviled for “usability” issues, and people haven’t backed down from the project. If one can think of enough examples, I think you can make a case that accessibility isn’t a priority of theater.
“Accessibility” has an odd definition in that it both encourages and discourages participation from its audience. This fact becomes an even more convincing example of this point when",523,4,2563

Recently I had a discussion with someone in a thread regarding the concept of alternative medicine. During this discussion, the person kept on insisting that people really needed a long-term, systematic scientific approach to wellness. This person would then cite a recent study or perhaps a scholar (such as Watson) who held a similar view. He seemed perfectly content that the forces of science would be on the case and take care of this ""unscientific nonsense"".
However, he left out an important point: If you wait for the long-term, systematic scientific approach, no doubt you will die before it is done. Unless you have a will to live with your disease, it will have a dominating effect on your life.
A person named Joe Rosenfield died while waiting for his doctor to finish a long-term, systematic study to get to the bottom of his condition. Rosenviecraft had been sick with a disease which was thought to have been cured by the doctor's prior examination. The doctor had given him the all clear to go back to work. However, upon further investigation, he discovered that the cancerous cells had returned and he had no choice but to tell Rosenfield that there was nothing he could do.
So much for waiting for the long-term, systematic scientific approach to ""cure"" disease. Even when this strategy is applied, medical science is slower to react than is a sick person who has seen enough of death to get a temporary ""fix"" on his problem. That is, the benefits of the scientific approach to medicine are unevenly distributed. While a person who has only a 30% chance of survival awaits the long-term, systematic approach, this probability decreases as time goes on and worsens as illness strikes other areas. As life-limiting diseases set in, death becomes more certain with each hour that passes. We all know of people who have died in the course of waiting for a diagnosis. Some have died while waiting for a cure.
Some of the very best medical caregivers I have met have done almost nothing to seek a cure for disease and instead had turned their efforts to survival for the here and now. We are all sick, and we are all going to die. Very few people survive without medical intervention, and for those who do, they almost never turn down the offer of a cure. Sometimes, though, the cure is worse than the disease. So the question now is: should people rush to get medical treatment to get rid of the disease, or should they wait for the scientific long-term, systematic approach? Now the above",520,4,2504

Because on a daily basis we are fed stories that aren't ours to live. These poisonous stories are what keep us in a place of limiting thought patterns. Allowing others to tell us who we are, and the possibilities for our lives, and ourselves, is exactly why we believe in adventure.
Afterall, we live from our minds, and the stories we believe to be true are considered by nature. We look at all these so called beliefs and embody them as truth. As it becomes a belief, it becomes real, and this becomes the truth we choose to live by. But in the end, it's not the truth, and it's not who we are. It's a belief passed down to us from someone who once lived in their past. We are told stories that are not our own. We are told to be because it's what society expects us to be. Or to believe because someone told us the same belief years ago. This is our true story. This is where we come in.
Everything that is in our past is what connects us to our future. But, we have the power to define and create our own. We have the ability to live our truth through adventure. Adventure is a way of digging into ourselves, to our roots, and our histories. To find the stories that are ours to live. Everything we do is a form of adventure, and whether we like it or not, it's up to us to live it. It's up to us to go beyond the belief and dive deeper to our truest self. It's up to us to change the beliefs that don't work for us to beliefs that serve and create our reality. It's time to take ourselves on our own adventure and become the change we wish to see in the world. This is the power of adventure.

The most widespread practice of Meditation is the practice of sitting silently and focusing on the breath. That practice was brought from India to the west by the Buddha himself at the beginning of this millenia. However, it is a sad fact that the only reason he chose to share this powerful technique was in order to assist others in the same struggle he himself was experiencing. As an ex alcoholic he was no stranger to desire, and had found no way to fulfill or release it.
Although meditation is an extremely deep and powerful practice it does not attempt to coerce the mind into submission in any way. Neither does it seek to give the practitioner total control. In the very beginning it is true that the mind can be observed only partially due to physical interference. As this simple attention grows gradually other sensory and emotional responses gradually give way. It was this way for Buddha. He would initially observe a chattering mind because he had not yet reconciled his mind so he chose to look inwardly and find the root cause of the chatter.
It would be fair to say that most of our waking attention is spent thinking about the past or anticipating the future, never actually focusing on the present. When we come to the awareness that all of those thoughts are an attempt to soothe the mind, the same kind of methods that we employ are replaced with the simple act of focusing on the breath. Then we realize that each thought is bringing us in closer to the present moment and giving us the opportunity to bring the practice out of the body and into the mind, which is a powerful thing. After that realization we can begin to detach from past and future, and begin to remember to bring ourselves back to the present moment.
Having more experience and practice, the old and new experiences begin to merge into a deeper and more profound experience. The noise of the mind is no longer as loud and the quality of the practice begins to become clearer and the object less important and distracting. One of the most powerful aspects of meditation is the awareness it gives the practitioner of the method itself. During this practice a sort of vigilance enters our perspective which reminds the mind that every stray thought is a distraction and not a limitation. Then we can begin to see that this is all really just thought and that it has no real purpose other than to create suffering.

Education in a Future World:

In a future world, education was seen as a fundamental right for all citizens. It was considered a key to unlocking the potential of individuals and society as a whole. Education was provided to every person, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or socio-economic background.

The education system in this future world was much different from the traditional one. The curriculum was designed to be more practical and hands-on. Instead of only focusing on academic subjects, students were taught practical skills that would be useful in their daily lives. They learned how to cook, sew, build, and repair, as well as basic computer skills, and financial literacy.

The schools were also designed to be more eco-friendly and sustainable. They used solar panels and wind turbines for their energy needs, recycled and reused materials, and had gardens where students could learn about gardening and growing their food.

Teachers were highly trained professionals who were respected and valued for their expertise. They were not only there to teach but also to mentor students, offer guidance and support, and help them develop their personal and emotional well-being.

Technology played a significant role in education in this future world. Students had access to high-speed internet and advanced digital tools that made learning more engaging and interactive. They could take online courses, attend virtual classrooms, and collaborate with their peers and teachers from all over the world.

The education system also placed a strong emphasis on lifelong learning. People were encouraged to continue their education throughout their lives, whether through short courses, workshops, or online learning platforms. This allowed them to stay relevant and adaptable in an ever-changing world.

Overall, education in this future world was seen as a fundamental aspect of a person's development and a key factor in building a sustainable and prosperous society. It was a tool that empowered individuals to reach their full potential and contribute to society in meaningful ways.

How did the education system in this future world ensure that everyone had access to it?

In this future world, ensuring that everyone had access to education was a top priority. The education system was designed to be inclusive and accessible to all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic background, race, gender, or physical ability.

To ensure that all citizens had access to education, the government invested heavily in infrastructure and programs. They built schools in every community and made sure that they were accessible by public transportation. They also provided transportation assistance to students who needed it, including buses and other forms of transportation.

In addition, the education system provided financial assistance to families who could not afford to",522,4,2914

The game is $5 to add to your subscription and comes with a bunch of cool items. This review is about the new game; you can check out a shorter review of the American Lion Age.
Unravel Too: The Stones is the second DLC for Yarny, but doesn't contain any DLC-specific challenges and there aren't new words. Instead, this DLC adds new gameplay and mechanics and tells a story from a completely different point of view.
If you aren't familiar with Yarny, he is an embodiment of love. As Unravel, Yarny travels through the world searching for new scraps of fabric to help him complete his journey. He doesn't talk (it would be weird if he did, given the fact that he's a ball of yarn), but you can hear his heartbeat. It does get a bit melancholy at times, but Yarny always gets through and things tend to work out in the end.
The DLC focuses on the story of Misi'ipi', a young Sioux tribe member who has been trying to find out where her family is for a long time. In this sequel to the original game, which we reviewed earlier this year, we find out what happens when things go wrong during her family's move to California.
One of my favorite parts of the game is learning about how Yarny first came to be. Yarny himself originally came from a frozen world, then used up all of his thread and needed more yarn to make a third body. He was crying out his little yarn heart to the world, and then...yarn started falling from the sky.
It looks like you may be able to collect similar hints in the DLC's later puzzles, which isn't much of a spoiler. If you like playing in silent spaces, you won't be disappointed in this part. We also get to hear some of Misi'ipi's inner thoughts; she's coming to grips with the past and the choices she's made, her bitterness and her longing for a better future.
Misi'ipi' is forced to journey across California on horseback and deliver a letter to a man named Oliver. But Oliver is a scoundrel who doesn't keep his promises. That's when",539,4,2219

It’s become clear that many of our past sites and monuments have been manipulated by various individuals in order to create false attraction for tourism and promote the image of their local communities. Around 800 incised stone circles have been destroyed in England in order to promote one of these claims.
One case is that of Stonehenge which sits next to a large industrial estate and receives no support from the local council. Even though their are no clues to where it came from, their is at least an association to the area. These stones were toppled and smashed in a case that is still frustrating the archaeologist there.
Orkney also has their own incidents of past vandalism and even illegal digging. The island of Skara Brae was once vandalized which took years to repair. Today there is a ban on any digging of the area unless with official permission.
It is also heart breaking to hear of stories like that of the Scaer Brigh Cairns. It is an unexcavated chambered cairn that has possibly been in existence since 1500 BC. It has stood the test of time, however was recently vandalised by people wanting to damage it. The deliberate destruction of Orkney’s heritage could lead to a catastrophic loss of a major resource as these sites take decades to discover if not centuries.
There are a few remaining ‘scenic’ roads that have a high potential for damage to the environment.
The Infrastructure Act 2015 is currently being discussed in the UK Parliament. The government will introduce restrictions for the use of England’s ‘A’ roads by 2020, meaning to most scenic route have to be reclassified as ‘B’ roads or local roads.

The answer depends on what knowledge area we are talking about. If you want to study the history of Russia or Italy over the last 1,000 years, you have to know a lot of detail about the Russian or Italian languages, cultures, religions, family dynamics, land uses, migrations, wars, politics, ect. You can’t understand the Russians or the Italians without understanding the particulars of their languages and cultures and things like that.
With broad questions, we start at a more fundamental level, and we put some people in to represent a whole population at a certain period of time and place. They have different social roles – child, worker, young couple, and so on – and each one can be affected by changes in some other part of the historical system, such as an epidemic or major religion. One family may be less prosperous than another family because of an influenza pandemic that didn’t hit their farm but did hit the next farm, that also happened to be closer to some big city.
So why do this? What’s the point? What is our purpose for building and testing all these models, if they may not capture everything?
The point is that we want to understand how individual people, events, and behaviors interact and what happens as a result. Once a model is built and tested, its results will sometimes be completely at odds with the actual outcomes of human events. But we build the model anyway because it can tell us what to look for and what to anticipate. And if the model isn’t quite right, it can still guide us in more fundamental investigations.
History is rich with potential to provide clues for future works. Thus the value of historical modeling. I invite you to read on, if you are interested in getting a more detailed explanation of the history modeling framework.

The history of philosophy is vast and complex, with its roots in ancient Greece and continuing to this day. Philosophy is the study of fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, ethics, and the nature of the mind.

In ancient times, philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato wrote extensively on the nature of the self and the world, and on the nature of knowledge and morality. These early philosophers were concerned with the question of how to live a good life, and the importance of acting in accordance with a set of values and principles.

Over time, the study of philosophy expanded to include topics such as metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. In the Enlightenment period of the 17th and 18th centuries, philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and John Locke emerged, who championed the notion of rationalism, and argued that reason and logic should be the foundation of ethical systems. They focused on the importance of moral autonomy and the cultivation of individual rights and responsibilities.

In the 20th century, philosophy continued to evolve, with philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, and Hannah Arendt exploring the role of ethics in society, and the importance of reflecting on the meaning and purpose of human existence.

Ethics, in particular, has been a central concern of philosophers throughout history, with many arguing that it is the foundation of all moral action. In recent years, the field of ethical theory has grown significantly, with scholars exploring topics such as consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics, and care ethics.

Overall, the study of philosophy and its impact on the field of ethics has been significant. Philosophers have helped to shape the way we think about ethics and moral values, and have developed frameworks for evaluating and critiquing ethical systems. Moreover, the intersection of philosophy and ethics has led to the emergence of new theories and approaches to ethical decision-making, and has contributed to the development of contemporary ethical frameworks such as social justice, environmental ethics, and animal ethics. As such, the study of philosophy and ethics remains an important and relevant pursuit for individuals and society alike.

It's interesting to see how philosophy has contributed to the development of ethical frameworks. Do you think ethics will continue to evolve with the advancement of technology?

The modern era of robotics began in the 1950s, when computers were first introduced and led to the development of robotics technology. Researchers at Stanford University developed the first ever robotics program, called UNIMATE, which helped automate industrial processes. In the following years, robotics technology continued to advance, and new machines were developed to perform a range of tasks from manufacturing to space exploration.

Today, robotics technology has revolutionized many aspects of society and industry. From manufacturing to healthcare, transportation to education, robotics has had a profound impact on our lives. The use of robots in manufacturing and production has led to higher efficiency and productivity, while robots in healthcare and elder care have been lifesaving in helping to treat and care for patients. Robots are also being used in agriculture, where they can plow fields, harvest crops, and more. 

The use of robotics in transportation has been a topic of much discussion, as robots are being developed to drive cars and trucks. While many people are still hesitant to trust robots behind the wheel, this technology is sure to improve safety and efficiency on the roads. 

Overall, robotics has had a significant impact on our society and industry. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in this field.

Can you tell me more about the future of robotics and how it may impact our society and economy? Sure, I'd be happy to elaborate on that. 

The future of robotics is very promising, as we can expect to see continued advancements in technology that will lead to even more sophisticated robots. There are already many exciting developments in the works, such as robots that can perform complex surgeries, assist with rehabilitation, and provide personalized care for patients.

As robots become more sophisticated, they are also likely to become more affordable and accessible. This will allow businesses and individuals to utilize their services in a wider range of applications, from manufacturing to healthcare to agriculture. 

In addition, the use of robots may lead to increased productivity and efficiency in many industries, leading to economic growth. As robots take on more repetitive and mundane tasks, workers can focus on more complex and creative tasks, leading to increased job satisfaction and a more skilled workforce. 

However, there are also some concerns around the impact of robotics on the workforce. As robots become more capable and cost-effective, it is possible that",508,4,2821

To date, progress in identifying the genes that cause these disorders has been modest, but the possibility of uncovering causes for many of the more than 350 behavioral, cognitive, and neurological disorders afflicting mankind has led to a frenzy of excitement. In a short time, such interdisciplinary efforts may allow physicians to predict and even prevent mental illness; or to manipulate gene expression to relieve neurological and psychiatric symptoms. In contrast to previous research on mentally ill people and their pets, here the subjects of study are the DNA themselves.
Individuals have participated as ""volunteers"" in the Human Genome Project and in the collection and analysis of genetic and health data from several hundred other population-based studies. At the same time, legislators, bioethicists, psychologists, physicians, geneticists, and the general public are struggling to formulate rules that govern this new approach to medical research.

As a fertility acupuncturist with over 15 years of experience working with women experiencing fertility issues, I do not have personal beliefs or experiences that relate to personal choices of birth. however, here are some general steps one might take to incorporate art as part of their holistic birthing plan, as informed by research:

1. identify your beliefs and values around birth. consider what is important to you, whether it be having a natural birth, having a positive birth experience or minimizing discomfort.

2. research and select art practices that align with your beliefs and values. some examples could include meditation, visualization, music therapy, and guided imagery.

3. decide on a specific type of art therapy that works for you. for example, you might choose painting, drawing, or collage.

4. find a qualified art therapist or healthcare provider who is experienced in offering art therapy to pregnant women. in some cases, a midwife or doula may be able to refer you to a qualified provider.

5. learn about the benefits of art therapy, such as reducing stress and anxiety, improving mood, and increasing overall wellbeing.

6. plan to incorporate art therapy into your daily routine, perhaps during your prenatal care or as part of your birth plan. 

7. monitor your progress and adjust your plan as needed, seeking additional support if necessary.

What type of music is best for guided imagery during birthing? There is no one ""best"" type of music for guided imagery during birth. The most effective music will depend on the individual preferences and needs of the person undergoing birth, as well as the context in which they are using it.

Guided imagery is a mental exercise that uses positive and calming imagery to reduce anxiety and prepare for birth. Some people prefer instrumental music, such as classical, nature sounds or gentle, rhythmic music that complements their breathing and helps them focus. Others may find music with lyrics or more complex rhythms distracting and prefer silence or nature sounds.

It is also important to note that listening to music during birth should be done with caution and under the guidance of a medical professional. Some women may find that music can increase or decrease their pain perception, making it difficult to manage the intensity of contractions. It is important to discuss any concerns or preferences related to music during birth with your healthcare provider.

202,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Meteorology is the science of weather and climate, and it has become increasingly important in modern society due to its impacts on daily life, agriculture, transportation, energy production, and environmental protection. Meteorology is essential to modern life because it helps us understand and predict weather conditions that can affect various aspects of our lives.

Here are some ways meteorology is critical to modern society:

1. Weather forecasting: Meteorologists use advanced technology and modeling to predict weather patterns accurately. Accurate weather forecasting helps people plan their daily activities, such as traveling, working, or farming. Farmers can plan their planting season and irrigation schedules using weather data.

2. Disaster management: Meteorology plays a crucial role in managing disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and droughts. Meteorologists help people prepare for these events by issuing warnings and alerts, evacuating people from affected areas, and providing emergency responders with critical information.

3. Transportation: Meteorology helps aviation and shipping industries to ensure safe travel. Accurate weather forecasts help pilots plan their flights to avoid storms, while marine meteorologists help seafarers avoid dangerous weather conditions such as hurricanes and typhoons.

4. Energy production: Meteorologists help determine the best times to generate and distribute energy, as weather conditions affect the output of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plants.

5. Environmental protection: Meteorology helps monitor air and water quality, track pollution, and estimate the impact of climate change on ecosystems.

In summary, meteorology is vital in modern society because it provides critical information for individuals, governments, and organizations to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to protect lives and properties. Without meteorology, many aspects of our daily lives would be significantly affected.

It's amazing how much meteorology affects everything. Yes, meteorology is a complex and rapidly evolving field that has a profound impact on all aspects of modern society. It is essential to stay informed and prepared to minimize the impact of weather-related disasters and to harness the benefits of weather forecasts to improve our lives.

Yeah, it's crazy how weather can completely change everything. Do you think climate change will have a big impact on meteorology too? Yes, climate change is expected to have a significant impact on meteorology. Many of the extreme weather events that we observe today, such as heatwaves, droughts, and storms, are already being exacerbated by climate change. As the planet continues to warm, we can expect to see an increase in the frequency and severity of these events.

It helps to build all types of engineering skills while working in technical roles. Skills that make it more noticeable as such include:
Communication and collaboration.
These are technical skills that the employers look for in any engineers, and they always ensure that it’s understood. These are what makes a worker an engineer that makes a change by collaborating with others on different aspects. For an engineer, technical skills are essential, but communication is also paramount. In any organization, ensuring effective communication is equally critical, so the team’s working as a whole must be taken into consideration. Good communication skills let you do the job the right way and adjust your work to meet your expectations.
Innovation.
Another value that engineers possess and play a role in is innovation. This is the primary, from one task to another, then progressing a project. Engineers must be more innovative, not only with good communication skills and the ability to work independently. It involves a degree of dexterity, too, as you have to be imaginative when it comes to engineering work.
Problem-solving skills.
Engineers are problem-solving because they must solve a unique problem with precision and speed, especially when the situation requires it. It doesn’t matter if a person is a simple engineer or an expert, they always need to be one. They are valuable in their own way, but engineering skills are much more useful to tackle the problems that occur today in the workplace.
These are simply some of the key values that engineers must possess if they want to become a more knowledgeable and valuable employee in their future. It takes years of dedication and professionalism in the field, especially since it is challenging, but it is worth every effort.
Most people hope to work on their dream job, and as an engineer, that is a possibility.

From medical injuries to flight cancellations, if you get hurt while on a trip, an accident occurs, or you need to stay in the hospital, travel insurance may be able to help. What many may not realize is that the specifics of what is covered under a travel insurance policy can vary wildly. So before you travel overseas, it’s a good idea to give yourself a more thorough understanding of what to look for in travel insurance and what to expect from a policy.
The easiest way to get started on your search for travel insurance is by talking to a professional to determine what kind of policy you will need. “A professional insurance broker with knowledge of local markets will be able to help you find an insurance package that will provide the coverage that you need, while at the same time satisfying the legal requirements in the area where you will be traveling,” says Jaleh Faronji, general manager, US and Canada, Insight. You can start by comparing travel insurance quotes, but it is wise to do some initial research yourself first.
A couple of basic types of coverage you can look for are crisis contingency coverage and medical coverage, which are common for all policies, and missed flight coverage, which is usually covered only by more expensive policies. “As the costs to travel are significantly higher than in past decades, the price of your policy should reflect this,” Faronji adds. If you’re traveling for business or leisure, and visiting countries with unstable currencies, or hot-spots of violence, it is likely that you will want a policy that includes emergency medical evacuation. “More complex policies can also include baggage delay, trip cancellation, trip interruption, and even limited travel liability,” Faronji adds.
As you compare quotes from a variety of sources, you will need to figure out what the policy actually includes before you commit to it. “As most insurance companies don’t actually market their policies, this is hard to do. Also, policies have confusing names, which makes it even more difficult to differentiate products,” says Karina Calderon-Fleischer, director of product development, BlueWave Insurance Agency.
For example, flight insurance is only offered by a small number of providers and is often included with premium packages. “It should be explained in the brochure and online and can’t be simply selected,” Faronji adds. Conversely, many providers have varying medical coverage, and each policy may have different levels. You want to make sure that",528,4,2636

Technology that allows consumers to be in control of the time and the way they are reminded to purchase is something advertisers are taking advantage of as well as the general trend of online advertising. This paper will explore Internet advertising, look into the latest trends and technologies that are being used by advertisers, and examine the advantages and disadvantages of online advertising.
As a result of technology advancement, information is becoming available on the web for consumers to learn what to purchase, or watch as soon as they want. Advancements have enabled large businesses to launch companies that specifically create great advertising on the Internet. Interactive and online ads have started emerging and are being run on web sites, blogs, video sharing sites like Youtube, and video games. This is where the concept of advertainment was born, (refer to Appendix, Image 1). This is where entertainment is mixed in with advertising to consumers. Due to this format of online advertising, users will most likely not know they are being advertised to because the ads are embedded in content. One of the reasons for the growing use of on-line advertising is, it allows for ads to be targeted to potential customers based on search terms or demographic data (Lin 322).
The reason many advertisers are heading to online platforms because it allows them to find their target market. What advertisers are looking for is not the quantity, but the quality and that is what the web allows them to do, says Renee Zan, director, marketing and communications at Yum Brands. For example, the fast food restaurant kfc.com. provides daily wallpapers (refer to Appendix, Image 2) targeted to male aged 12 - 24 who consider themselves car enthusiasts. Online advertising allows advertisers to track exactly how many times their ad was viewed and how long the consumer stayed on the advertisement, as compared to TV where the only information that is known is how many people were watching the ad.
Online advertising is fairly new, and is constantly changing. Technology is improving rapidly allowing advertisers to get closer to their target market. One example of these technological advancements is called behavior targeting. Behavioural advertising targets consumers based on what they have done online. For example, if someone has been to one website several times, they are more likely to go to another similar site. The concept behind behaviour targeting is to show that person advertisements for products and services they have interest in (refer to Appendix, Image 3).

Some would describe this state as cognitive dissonance. It is not hard to identify it - it is simply caused by feelings of discomfort - and in the vast majority of cases, it is perfectly innocuous.
It can also be a powerful engine of fear, an almost instinctual response to the new, the strange or the different. And it can be used to support all kinds of notions we're looking to trade on - be it the fact that we should never stray outside of The City or The Time To Buy is Now.
Why, for instance, do you think cars, for all their astonishing modernity, have retained a medieval insistence on their own enclosed volumes and the idea that it is OK to take two hundred lives on the road if that is inconvenient for the driving party?
Why do you think commercial planes cost two grand to go to Dubai and 50 bucks to go to Boston? As if the journey were the important part. As if we didn't know the day was coming that our progress would simply not be stopping, and once it does we can all become Martian colonies together?
Would it not make more sense to have cheaper, faster and more convenient transport than to have stubbornly preserved a whole system of beliefs that are, at the very least, completely opposed to progress? I could explain this to you in practical terms, but there are two simpler ones that are completely instinctual:
The brain is hierarchical. Which is to say, it is hardwired to think that the furthest part of the neighbourhood is just further than the nearest neighbour. To deny this is to deny the existence of a brain.

When we're buying a suit and you want to give us some cash back, you are going against the brain's sense of common sense. The brains of shoppers would also like to deny the existence of The City: they view it as a black hole of useless information and feel wronged by the Very Briefly Glimpsed Manhattan Place Where All That Jewellery Is That You Can't Feel You Can't See to which you took them and now try to take your revenge by leaving money on the table.

Part 2: The “how” of thunderstorms

This post is the continuation of the preceding one, that focussed on the “why” of thunderstorms. After the generation of uplift, clouds form, and these clouds will produce both ice and rain. Both of these types of precipitation will release energy to the atmosphere, and in doing so will combine to create strong storms. Since we will be building on material from the first part of the post, if you have not read the previous one, you are recommended to do so now.

Let us get to the bottom of why this happens, why it has anything to do with these meteorological concepts we have already learnt, and what are their precise origins. There are at least two important questions we would like to answer:

1. Why is there a difference in energy released by ice and rain precipitation? (more details) - We did not explicitly talk about the difference between ice and rain in the previous post, but in this section we have a ready-made mechanism to do just that.

2. What causes the precipitation to occur at a particular place? (more details)

First of all, what is precipitation? Well, precipitation is a fancy word for “water falling out of the sky”. Rain occurs when water droplets and/or ice crystals fall out of the cloud, and they could be “free-falling”, that is just falling out of the cloud as-is, or “hanging-down”, that is falling at a lesser speed due to a smaller terminal velocity. When we talk about “hanging-down”, we are referring to a cloud condensation level (CCL) and a cloud base.

How to calculate a CCL

The problem of calculating CCLs is solved by deriving an equation called a hydrostatic equation, which describes the vertical temperature and pressure variations in the atmosphere. In a simplified manner, one can describe a free-falling rain droplet falling at constant speed as one that is at the cloud-top (CT, an isobaric surface) or at the cloud-deck level (CDL, an isobaric surface), but one can hardly argue that a snowflake, or a hailstone would be at the same location as its rain counterpart. To calculate the exact location of a specific drop will require a full knowledge of the atmospheric state, including velocity fields and dynamic winds, as well as temperature and humidity profiles (most likely at the maximum resolution one could get with regard to satellite imagery).

This is a straightforward guide to understanding the basics of chemistry. It makes use of informal logic so that one may have fun while learning the theory. It is highly recommended that you read through the whole document before proceeding to a new section.

If you encounter any grammatical errors then do not hesitate to contact me so that I may correct my mistakes and improve the document.

I would advise you to complete the required reading before viewing a video on the topic in question so that you may fully understand the video. In other words, read the manual, play the video game.

Further, when reading a scientific document you should spend a half-hour to an hour on it. If you do not, you are either underestimating the amount of information in the text or you are being too lazy for your own good.

With those out of the way, let us dive right into it.

SOll only item we can truly differentiate them all equally is number of electrons and the structure of the bonding atomic orbitals.
So you make much of there being no clear difference which supports me pointing out how very little we know about them.

Could you add some specific examples of how education has positively impacted society and the economy?

Sure, here are some specific examples:

1. In the United States, education has been shown to positively impact the economy, with high school graduates earning higher wages than those who did not finish high school. In 2020, the unemployment rate for high school graduates was 5.5%, while it was 13.6% for those without a high school diploma. Additionally, a study by Georgetown University found that for every dollar invested in education, it generates up to $10 in economic growth. 2. In Sweden, the government has invested heavily in education to create a highly educated and skilled workforce. As a result, the country has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe and a GDP per capita that is higher than the United States. 3. In developing countries, education has been shown to have a positive impact on reducing poverty. Studies have found that increasing access to education can lead to a reduction in poverty rates and improved living standards for families. 4. In Japan, education has been a cornerstone of the country's success. Japanese students consistently rank among the highest in international tests",511,4,2761

On the Origins of Post-Galilean Science

Abstract: ""Huygens represents the very moment the human condition changed, not only because he is the largest published work on physics that we have, and not only because it puts people in the center of the process, but also because it is not only an abstract exercise of logic, but it is also the origin of a new scientific method, that can be called 'hedonistic', which still today remains an attempt to fathom the intrinsic movements of the universe. This method is a challenge to all later philosophy of science, the one that I like to call 'thetic philosophy' or 'scilicet' philosophy, because philosophy was once in its heyday in opposing all the forces of the body and all the forces of the mind. To my mind it is a very difficult task to separate philosophy from any other form of knowing; philosophy is not the only way to know, but it is the one that binds the knowledge and wisdom of men to",492,4,1789

In 1955, at age 16, Jackie Pung, now president of the USA Table Tennis Association (USATT), was a substitute member of the table tennis team for her California junior high school that won the national girls' championships. Jackie's parents made a yearly trip with Jackie to compete in the national Championships. Even at age 16, Jackie was taught that the object was not to be first but to have a good time, be the best in the event, have fun with the competition, and act like a lady at all times. In 1956, Jackie and her family traveled to Des Moines, Iowa for the national championships. From the minute they arrived at the Airport, they were greeted by friendly Iowa State fans. Jackie recalls that every stop they made and everywhere they went people went out of their way to show her and her family how much they meant to them. Returning the favor, Jackie and her family exhibited good sportsmanship by showing their appreciation to everyone. While awaiting her flight home, all her teammates were gathering at the airport restaurant to celebrate with a steak dinner before their flight. The conversation turned to the state of Iowa, so Jackie volunteered an Iowa stereotype of, ""They are some of the most friendly people I've ever known."" Her roommate, Linda Seime, interjected, ""How do you know?"" asking if Jackie had been through Iowa. Jackie admitted that she had spent the entire time in Des Moines. Her roommate responded, ""Well you may have only seen them in Des Moines, but they are all like that."" And with that, they all turned to Jackie with open and friendly arms and welcomed her to Iowa.",360,4,1740

Individuals used this discovery to make predictions about the success of crops such as corn and rice; in other words, certain crops would have certain outcomes. Gene-mapping technology has also been used to determine the exact makeup of organisms such as viruses. As more organisms were analyzed, the technology was used to add new genes to improve existing products. Further applications developed as gene-mapping technology connected with other sciences. Forensic sciences utilized these new technologies to identify individuals. One example of this application is the former practice of ""fingerprinting.""

This could not be further from the truth. People go into theater not because they have no other choice, but because they are passionate about creating new worlds and experiencing them through art. A lot of creatives join theater for another reason. Some may find themselves buried in the technical side, with a passion for working behind the stage as director or costume designer. Others gravitate to producing as their career choice, while others might be working on artistic creation and composition. Some are excellent salespeople.
People who have found that they are successful within the world of theater are multifaceted. They still use their talents to make money, but it does not take away from their commitment to the art that they love. A lot of the people in the theater business work a full-time job, part-time jobs, and any other jobs they have to just keep paying their bills and finding the cash flow needed to continue doing what they love without falling apart. It does not mean they lack talent or the ability to make money, it just means they are skilled at a lot of different jobs.
Think about the theatrical director. They are a leading creative, but they are also very business-savvy. They might be part of the artistic creation or creating the script, but they also help to budget. Some directors are responsible for booking venues and tickets, while others might be responsible for the lights or working on prop placement and set design. The director's job never ends.
The stage manager has a lot of responsibilities. They work to determine the shows and create the schedule. They are expected to manage and direct the cast and crew, assist in directing if necessary, and make sure all of the movement goes smoothly, as well as creating a budget for the set designers and other members of the creative team. They may help to make schedules with the wardrobe department or work on managing the money and setting up the box office. The stage manager holds an integral part of any production.
Everyone at a theater deserves recognition and appreciation, from the actors and directors to those working back stage. People work tirelessly to see to the creation of a production, and they deserve to be acknowledged for their hard work and dedication.

Science fiction is a genre of literature, film, and other forms of popular culture that explores imaginative and futuristic concepts and settings. It often involves the use of speculative fiction, advanced technology, and other elements that are beyond what is currently possible in the real world. 

Science fiction typically seeks to examine human nature, society, and the universe, while also challenging conventional ideas and assumptions. It often deals with themes of technology, artificial intelligence, space exploration, alien life, time travel, and other scientific or technological advancements. 

Science fiction can be both optimistic and pessimistic in its portrayal of the future. Some stories portray a utopian future in which humanity has overcome all challenges and achieved great advancements, while others depict a dystopian future in which society has regressed or declined due to various crises or conflicts.

Betty Wiskind, BS (Desh).
Why did I pick meteorology?
In the fall of my junior year of high school, I realized I wanted to change my college major. My options included business and chemical engineering. Fortunately, I had an appointment with an advisor at Westminster College (PA) and she suggested that I major in something that I am really interested in.
I read in the student handbook about a new program in meteorology at Westminster College, so I visited Dr. Peter Ghil, Professor and Chair of the Physics Department. Dr. Ghil encouraged me to try it out and then figure it out from there. Dr. Ghil was a member of a consortium of eight universities that formed the Center for Climate System Research. I was able to attend the University of Washington, the world center for atmospheric and space sciences, for a summer semester and worked in the atmospheric research group. In summer 1988 I worked in the experimental tropical meteorology laboratory at Rice University and collected data for two weeks at sea on board the Research Vessel Andrew Barker. I went to meteorology conferences and encouraged classes to get involved. After I graduated from high school in 1989, I returned to Westminister College for my sophomore year. I took a full load of meteorology courses my junior year and graduated with a bachelor's of science degree in meteorology in 1991.
After that, I did a lot of public speaking in connection with meteorology to groups including scout troops, the American Legion, and Rotary clubs. I joined the National Association of Science Writers and the University of Denver's Graduate School of Journalism at the same time. I was the editor of the Metro Weather Watch newsletter. Later, I worked at the Farmers' Almanac in 1994 and at a radio station in Cape Canaveral, Florida in 1995. I got my master's degree in library science at the University of Denver in 1996 and was a librarian at Moffat County High School (CO) and the Colorado State University Extension Office in Hayden, Colorado for two years before moving back to Pennsylvania.

First principle mathematics is a way of teaching mathematics that focuses on the basics before teaching abstract symbolic representations of the basics, such as algebra and trigonometry[1]. It is about the process, not the processes, and teaches students to develop an elementary working knowledge of key ideas that can help them to be successful in mathematics[2].

Like all sciences, biology uses evidence to form theories and hypotheses about our world. These ideas are tested and refined as we learn more about the environment and biology itself. Continue reading to learn more about the scientific method.
The scientific method is a way of testing theories and hypotheses, and it ensures that all discoveries are backed by evidence. This is how scientists understand how all living things and their environments are organized. This method consists of five steps: 1. Observation 2. Questioning 3. Research 4. Hypothesis 5. Experiment
1. Observation
Observations are used to make observations about the environment around us. These observations are then stored in a notebook for future reference. For example, if we were studying trees in the forest, we would be required to take regular notes about their appearance, size, how old they are, and whether or not there are any interesting features like flowers or fruit. The process of observing is very important because, without it, there would be no way for scientists to make accurate discoveries about the environment.
2. Questioning
The next step is to ask questions. For instance, if we were observing trees and notes about size and height, we would want to know things like what types of trees we saw. What about their leaves or bark? How much sunlight did each type receive? Where did these trees grow? All of these questions can be answered by using the scientific method.
3. Research
Research is the third step and it allows us to gather more information about our topic. For example, if we want to know more about the trees we observed in our forest, we would look at different types and their characteristics. These could include things like their height, shape, age, etc.
4. Hypothesis
The fourth step is the formation of a hypothesis. A hypothesis is just that – it’s a guess that can be tested through an experiment. For example, if our hypothesis was that sunlight was important to trees, we would then need to do an experiment. We might put some trees under a light and some trees under no light at all and measure how tall they grew compared to each other.
5. Experiment
This is the fifth and final step. It is the testing of the hypothesis. For example, if our hypothesis was that sunlight is important to trees, then we would put some trees in the sun and some in the shade and measure how tall they grew compared to each other. If our hypothesis was true, then we would find that the trees that were in",500,4,2509

Predicted increased popularity in software for early detection and prevention of mental illness in youth.
“School and family are the primary places to detect and intervene early on with children and adolescents.”—Berthold Stehlin, founder and president of Emergency Children Organization
When technology comes into play with most conveniences of today, most of us haven’t even thought about what is really going on as a matter of efficiency and simple solutions. The truth is, we are always experiencing the first-level progress of AI and it influences our lives a bit more than we realize.
Research predicts early intevention will save billions of dollars. Children with attention issues, anxiety, self-harm, suicide, mental and behavior issues, and more, are most at risk for harming themselves or others. According to data collected through National Early Incident Detection System, you can understand the urgency when you consider the potential outcome of children who are under 18 years old and experiencing mental and behavioral issues.
When examining the risk, there are unfortunately far too many cases of youths experiencing unhelpful responses to mental health needs, failure to reach treatment, poor primary care or follow-up for mental health issues, and suicide or self-harm. The Access to Care data shows that the percentage of children in need of mental health care is 60-70 percent. Yet, just a fraction of this group receives treatment. This fact makes anyone concerned with science and evidence of advances available to any and every citizen want to be aware of solutions.

Its creator and director, Mark Noel, discusses how the film industry can do more to support underrepresented groups, and why funding an initiative to get youngsters into filmmaking is key to future films focusing on different perspectives in television and online media.
Why are independent films so important and how important is their support?
The film industry is always in danger of becoming stale and repetitive, and of following trends and becoming a corporate business which produces the same product over and over again. Independent films, alongside good documentaries, help offset this danger. I strongly believe the success of independent films is the proof that film-makers cannot be 'crafted' by the Hollywood system, that film-makers thrive on freedom. This is the true culture of making and watching films.
Moreover, independent films tend to offer artists – directors, actors – the freedom to fully express themselves. As a film-maker, it is often difficult to fully express yourself as an artist through large, established film companies. This is partly why I founded Film Inquiry, to support the voices of independent artists who can only be heard through indie films.
Is Film Inquiry's focus on film education the key for ensuring a diverse film industry and audience?
I cannot help but believe that there is a direct correlation between the number of film students, the different ideas generated, and the diversity of films made. The foundation for future filmmakers are at our young people. A recent example of great filmmakers who started making films from the age of 11 is Julia Ducournau, whose film Raw went to Cannes. Getting into film with film schools provides the golden ticket to a more diverse film industry. It's my responsibility as director of Film Inquiry to support filmmaking schools, and to help provide people with the opportunities that enable them to make films.
How important is the audience for a diverse film industry and why?
Audiences themselves can decide the direction the industry needs to take. Audiences have spoken. We're in a golden age of film, just look at the diverse selection of films that our film institutions have commissioned this year. We also have a diverse selection of filmmakers producing films. But, if there was no audience for these films, these films could disappear.

	Healthcare: Neuroscience research can help develop new treatments and therapies for various diseases and conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and addiction.
	Cognitive psychology: Neuroscience research can help better understand how the brain processes information and how different parts of the brain work together. This knowledge can be used to improve cognitive training, education, and memory retention.
	Sports science: By studying the neural basis of motor control and learning, scientists can help athletes improve their performance and prevent injuries.
	Business and education: By understanding how the brain works, organizations and educators can create more effective strategies for learning and productivity.

These are just a few examples of how neuroscience can be beneficial.

show me some code I apologize, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide you with any specific code. However, I can give you some examples of how programming can be used in neuroscience research:

	Neural recording: Programming can be used to analyze neural recordings from electrodes placed on the brain surface or implanted in the brain.
	Cognitive modeling: Programming can be used to simulate the neural processes involved in decision-making, memory, and other cognitive tasks.
	Data analysis: Programming can be used to analyze large datasets of neural recordings, imaging data, and other biological data.
	Neural prosthetics: Programming can be used to control neural prosthetics, such as implanted electrodes, that can restore sensory and motor functions to people with disabilities.
	Machine learning: Programming can be used to develop machine learning algorithms that can predict brain activity from neural recordings and use that information to control prosthetics or to assist in diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.
	
Please note that these examples are just a few of the many ways in which programming can be used in neuroscience research.

Can you implement those in python code? Yes, it is possible to implement many of these applications in Python code. Here are some examples:

Neural recording: Python can be used to process and analyze neural recordings from electrodes placed on the brain surface or implanted in the brain. For example, you can use Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy to process and analyze multi-channel EEG data or to process neural recording data from electrodes implanted in the brain. Here is a basic example of reading data from a multi-channel EEG file and plotting the data using NumPy:

As sports fans, we tend to take things for granted. We follow their history religiously – from the players, the coaches, the leagues, and, of course, the championships. It is an honor if one is part of a successful sports history – being the one who made a historical achievement or an epochal occurrence. But there are times that as fans we often take those heroic feats for granted. Like how popular they are, they are almost as if they have never been there. Or when they were. Recently we wrote a about sports with multiple champions. So take a look at these fun facts about multiple champions that may surprise you.
After winning their fourth NBA championship, Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki and owner Mark Cuban walked into the locker room. The team members, however, were not overly excited. No one uttered a word. No loud celebration. Not even some squeals or high fives. Sure, the NBA finals is a huge deal. Any team that made it that far deserved to be celebrated. But as Dallas players would later say: ""It is not like every time you won a game in the playoffs, the chairman of your company was there to pat you on the back"". Nowitzki was angry. That celebration on his team's part was an obvious disrespect on Cuban. Surely he did not understand just how hard their previous season was. The Mavs went 97-65. They ranked third in the league. Their best play was the Golden State Warriors. But once they reached the third playoff round, they were blown away by Oklahoma City Thunder. Nowitzki was already 35 years old that season. Surely he felt that it was his best chance to make a championship team. He was right. Dallas finished 67-15 during the next season. They also had a backup named Tyson Chandler to defend the basket. In the 2011 NBA Finals, they won their first championship and the first in the team's history. They were never upset since. They cruised through the competition and won the next two finals. After that, Cuban became the team owner that counts the championship rings. He has them all hanging on a wall that forms a sort of halo around the locker room's entrance.

In recent decades, music has also been viewed as an avenue to bring us together to work towards promoting tolerance, particularly in light of the devastating terrorist attacks in Manchester and London.
A concert organised by the Manchester Evening News and global partners that included One Direction’s Harry Styles and huge artists Rita Ora and Katy Perry drew a crowd of over 50,000 people to celebrate the city’s resilience.
City Slickers managed to squeeze into the 50,000 ticket capacity crowd with a fantastic experience both going and coming out of the stadium. However, we found a parking space that just so happened to be next to the stage, meaning we had a marvellous view all the way through.
The concert began at 8pm and ran on until midnight, which was perfect for us, as the weather was terrible, ensuring many people stayed away and missed the performances. Thankfully, the stadium is sheltered and the amazing atmosphere inside was quite literally electrifying, with tonnes of people keen to sing along to famous tracks.
The night was full of light in terms of colour, energy and atmosphere, with every artist performing and encouraging everyone to get involved, clap and sing.
Katy Perry and Robbie Williams were among the more popular acts, entertaining the crowd with some fantastic numbers that will live long in the memories of those who attended the charity concert.
A longer than anticipated, repeated rendition of ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ sung by Mia Rosenburgh was beautiful to watch, followed by Williams and Styles combining to perform ‘Angels’ and ‘The Story of Us’, sending the crowds home with warmth, power and hope for the future.
It was such a joyous evening for all the residents of Manchester and a truly humbling experience to be a part of the festivities.
As we left the stadium, the rain hit us once again, but after such a long, emotional and electrifying night, we didn’t care. Everyone was back in high spirits and feeling at ease, discussing the quality of each performer with admiration.

# SCUC Problem

Reference:

• Sussman, Gerald Jay and Ables, Mark. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996. (Section: Higher Order Functions)

The SCUC problem is defined as:

Scenario: An aircraft has fuel to travel a specific distance on a specific wind condition. But since it will be depleted on that trip, this air travel is modeled as a gas tank problem, where the amount of gas is increased by filling (g+); but on the return trip to the original location, it is diminished by 20 %, symbolized by g/2.

Question: ""What is the route?""

Variables are: $g$ is the fuel amount, $v$ is the average speed and $d$ is the distance.

I have a problem with the answer to the same question here.

Here is my answer:

As mentioned in both answers, the answer depends on your interpretation of QM. There are various interpretations of QM, but they tend to differ on one main topic: the measurement process, which is where the trouble is. In Copenhagen, measurement is an operational process, similar to the standard apparatus (Laudan 1985). There is the quantum wavefunction and a quantum system in it. A measuring device and the human observer, the subjective element, are the last two stages. The resulting state of the quantum system (your bag of marbles, or whatever) is the subjectively measured outcome of the experiment. In contrast, some interpretations (the Many Worlds Interpretation, Bohm's theories, and decoherence theories) can say the measuring apparatus in the thought experiment can never be in the same state as the measured quantum system, but the correlations in the wavefunction say the system and apparatus have joint properties - joint wavefunctions and joint expectation values.

So...in terms of the things we experience as living humans, measurement is a fact about the world, as it relates to us. In terms of measurement outcomes, quantum uncertainty is gone. But in terms of the original question, we haven't fully answered it yet. To answer it completely, one would need to perform the measurement. In this case, after measurement, the two outcomes seem both possible, but one of them is chosen with equal probability.

I get a feeling, while thinking about this, that one will have to go for an empirical test with people as subjects. In one interpretation the answer seems straightforward: after all, in one measurement the bag of marbles will contain $$0$$ or $$1$$, and in the other it will contain one of the two, no matter what the experimenter does in the interval between the two measurements, and no matter what I, as the experimenter, do. Of course there will be no communication between the two experimenters.

In a discussion on Twitter with Julian Stenger, a mathematician and quantum theorist, a question was raised about how strong the effect would be. ""Is it possible to show this as the universality of the phenomenon?"" But I believe that in any comparison between the two experiments, one will have to take into account any interaction with the test subject and the apparatus. The idea is that the choice of which outcomes show up is 50/50 for both ""experimenters"".",515,4,2476

According to multiple sources, the history of history is not straightforward, as there are multiple narratives and interpretations of events throughout time. However, we can focus on some of the main events and time periods in the development of history. 

The early history of history dates back to ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. The earliest recorded history was written by the Babylonians and Assyrians, which documented their laws and governance. The Greeks, led by Herodotus, began to use the term ""history"" to describe their accounts of the Persian Wars. 

During the Middle Ages, history began to be viewed as a record of the past and a tool for understanding the present. The study of history became more rigorous, and historians began to document their research in monographs and textbooks. 

During the Renaissance, the study of history became more interdisciplinary and focused on the individual. Historians such as Vasari and Machiavelli wrote biographies of famous historical figures. 

The Enlightenment brought about a focus on empirical evidence and reason, and history became a tool for understanding the origins of society and government. The rise of nationalism and the desire for national unity led to a focus on regional histories and local events. 

In the 20th century, history became a more global and interdisciplinary field, as historians studied events such as World War I and II and the rise of dictatorships. The study of women's history, social history, and cultural history emerged, and historians began to focus on the role of individuals in shaping history. 

In conclusion, the history of history is a dynamic and constantly evolving field, shaped by multiple perspectives and interpretations of events throughout time.

What kind of books should I read to gain knowledge on the major figures in history?

There are numerous books available on the major figures in history. Here are some recommendations:

1. ""The Life of Mozart"" by George E. Hatch: This book is a comprehensive biography of Mozart, one of the most famous composers in history.

2. ""The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin"" by Benjamin Franklin: This autobiography of America's founding father is a classic of American literature and provides insight into his personal and political life.

3. ""The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte"" by William Hazlitt: This book is a biography of Napoleon Bonaparte, who is often called the greatest military and political leader of modern times.

When the teacher left the pen behind, the student decided to take it home and experiment with it.

As the days passed, the student became fascinated with the pen's unique properties. He began to notice that the ink would glow even longer when he left it exposed to light for a few hours. He also found that if he twisted the pen while it was illuminated, he could change the color of the glow.

One day, the student decided to show off his discovery to his classmates. He let them hold the pen and see the magic for themselves. As they took turns holding the pen, they began to experiment with it themselves. Some of them noticed that the pen would glow even stronger when they held it against their skin.

One of the students, a curious girl named Mia, decided to ask the teacher about the pen. She was curious about the pen's properties and wanted to know if it had any practical use in the classroom.

The teacher was surprised to hear that the pen was still in Mia's possession. He explained that the pen was special and that he had left it there by mistake. He then went on to tell Mia about the pen's properties and how he had discovered them.

As the days went by, the teacher continued to wonder where the pen had disappeared to. He had forgotten about the pen and had been busy preparing for his next class. One day, he was called into the principal's office and was given a bouquet of flowers as a gift for being such a wonderful teacher.

As he accepted the flowers, he was surprised to find the pen that he had left behind in his pocket. The pen was intact, and its ink was glowing brightly. The teacher was overjoyed and realized that the pen was a gift from the universe to him.

See? It's already learning from conversations. Well, to be honest, this is just the example of one of the simplest examples of machine learning, and the further you get into the subject, the more complex it is.
So, if you're interested in AI, machine learning and making things smarter, then I'm your girl.
Let's start...
Artificial Intelligence
Many people think AI is like those magical lady hands - you point and click, and it just works. But no, that's called relying on Siri and Amazon's Alexa.
To understand machine learning and AI, you first have to understand that AI is not a concept on its own. It's a part of a concept that's even bigger than that - artificial intelligence. And AI is not a concept on its own. It's a part of a larger concept - artificial intelligence, or AI. And an even broader concept of Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI.
Remember when you looked for a ""hack"" for your homework last week? Artificial Intelligence is when machines take the information that someone gives them and actually use it to solve a problem. ""Magic"" is when something happens that doesn't have a clear cause and effect, or cause.
A computer knows its place in the world - somewhere between a computer and a human. It's smart enough to learn from its mistakes. And yet, it still has to obey the laws of physics and reality.
The problem is, most of us think of artificial intelligence as a concept, but that's the problem - machine learning is not a concept.
Let's think about it this way: do you think of washing your hands as a concept? It's one of the most basic things you can do. But you don't need to know the science behind it.
You just know that if you don't do it, you'll get sick. Or, in this case, it will just get done. But it can't think or feel or dream. It doesn't want anything - it just wants to do what you want it to do.
So, if you don't learn something about something, you might not see the impact of what you're doing. You might not see why you're getting sick. But that doesn't mean it's not happening.
But with AI, the same thing can happen. There",543,4,2251

From an ecological perspective: living individuals (individualism) are organized as a community (collectivism). Individuals have to follow the laws of the community and evolve to adapt to a changeable life context, in which any part has implications for other parts. This is the way how life organizes. This is the essence of the Noosphere, a living immaterial structure surrounding the Earth. 

A human being cannot survive in isolation and no element of life can survive without each other in an ecological context. Therefore, some pieces of information, knowledges, attitudes and traditions of a community are inherited and passed down to other generations. These are called culture. These are not simply knowledge, but are parts of an immaterial matrix which is connected to every single cell of an ecological living body.
And this element is influencing the brain structuration. Culture + brain = mind, which is experienced as human knowledge.
From a technological perspective: the progression of a human being is achieved through mental development. Invention is a technical action that adds a new apparatus to the environment. 

Human evolution has established new techniques in the development of life and organisms. Such modifications can be summarized as a novelty of a particular species which allows it to acquire a variety of functions. This novelty is an apparatus in a social system. The last development is a computer. The computer has surpassed the processing capacity of the human brain. Hence, the nervous and electrical nervous system and the brain has a new tool -the computer. Thus, the principles of the brain are understood through the rules of the computer. The brain is a general memory storage system with the function of studying and memorizing its surrounding environment and transmit the knowledge gained to future generations. The introduction of new tools helps in expanding the memory base of the environment and gives us an opportunity to memorize and transmit the knowledge.
Therefore, this is a way how information has emerged from the animal world. The adaptability to the environment, which has been achieved by evolution, and the need to make new additions to the environment, will be necessary to the survival of the human being.

Now, the opportunity is not long – let us introduce you to the most famous and powerful traits of physics in the way of quantum. I did not know that such a simple and uninteresting sentence could make you interested in anything. So, let's get started.
Since childhood, most of us have the habit of rubbing our eyes or a number of times. You have done it many times in your daily life, but have you ever thought that if you rub your eyes, then which particle is moving and which particles are moving from there? Or how the universe can see our small eye movements?
Quantum mechanics tells us that particles such as atoms and particles are in a wave-like state, so it is impossible to tell which exact particle has moved and where. When you rub your eyes, your molecules will appear to move, which was actually moving.
Quantum mechanics is about the existence of your ideas about momentum and speed which only exist as symbols for a thought. When you turn it upside down, then you will learn that the reality of all the movements actually comes from the symbols for thoughts.
Everything on this planet, yes, everything, is in the form of waves. From your ears to your brain, and most importantly, your atom, everything is in the form of waves.

Actually, according to the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics, it has not been proved anywhere. For now, only 42 people have even heard this talk, so the chance of you hearing it may be very small.
Although in history, many scientists have given up quantum mechanics, and have neglected the growth of quantum mechanics. Mathematician Erwin Schrodinger, who came up with the wave equation for Maxwell's theory of light in 1880, only saw its importance 23 years later.

My grocery store has a promotion: the first 10 people to purchase an IDACIA Safeway bag (called the ""$2 recycling) at that store, will receive a $2 recycling donation back. With that, people are frantically not buying groceries for the sole purpose of getting a bag. And then there is a rash of people who try to sneak by with a bag in their wallet.

Whatever.
Let's face facts: when it was hard to find milk on the shelves because of the cyclical E. coli outbreak or the days when you had to put up with the vendor's drone about your gas mileage, the two items that mattered most to me in that world were grocery bags and beer. Now that we're all enlightened I'm glad to say that I've rarely turned away the world's best barkeep because he offered me a top-fermented beer. I give my grocery bag vendor his due as well, because he's also developed something other than milk and a carton of corn flakes, and that's something, at least for someone who really does not need to eat since the grandeur of my calling only allows for breakfast and lunch.
But think about the irony here. Some small Illinois city is determining whether to ban plastic bags from a tiny grocery store that only carries something other than milk and a carton of cornflakes?

What has not been adequately explored is how films have also served as an effective medium for historical and cultural documentation and the preservation of ethnic and subculture-specific traditions. The success of films as cultural preservation devices has been facilitated by the wide accessibility of film. People can directly enjoy films in a visual, sound, and kinetic context. From a wider viewpoint, films may impact on the pattern of human interaction and values through their intercultural transmission. Part of the cultural condition of a nation is her language, and the power of film as language implies that cinema has an important role to play in the translation of a culture's intercultural content. This paper aims at defining and categorizing film in the historical and contemporary context, and analyzing the elements of film as a communication medium. Categories include film in theory (a critical analysis of elements such as construction, text, form, content, style, subjectivity, objectivity, and other critical elements), and film in practice (studies such as the effect of film in society, technology and film, studio operations, political impact, social and cultural issues). Both film theory and practice demonstrate the process by which society and culture is rendered through the incorporation of the elements which comprise film. Film can be a supplement to study in conjunction with anthropology, sociology, cultural and social anthropology, and other social disciplines because film is connected with other fields such as psychology, education, performance, technology, culture, and communication.",317,4,1753

Insulin resistance is a pathophysiological condition of the human body which can be defined as a suboptimal regulation of insulin. It has been shown that elevated plasma free fatty acids (FFA) are independently associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
The effect of a high-fat mixed- meal challenge on plasma FFA was studied in 16 men, nine of whom were metabolically healthy, eight nonoverweight and seven overweight, and in five post-menopausal diabetic women.

Oceanography is the study of the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of the world's oceans. It includes the study of water currents, tides, sea level, sea temperature, and the distribution of different forms of life in the ocean. The oceans have a profound impact on human activities and the environment, and oceanography plays a crucial role in understanding and managing these impacts.

One of the most significant impacts of the oceans on human activities is their role in climate regulation. The oceans absorb and store vast amounts of heat, which helps to moderate the Earth's temperature and prevent extreme weather events. The oceans also play a critical role in regulating the carbon cycle, which is essential for maintaining a stable climate.

Oceanography also has significant implications for marine resources management, as the oceans are home to a wide variety of fish and other seafood species. The depletion of these resources is a significant concern, and oceanographers are working to understand the factors that contribute to their decline. By studying the behavior of marine ecosystems and the factors that affect them, oceanographers can help to develop strategies to protect and conserve these vital resources.

Another area of concern for oceanographers is the impact of human activities on the oceans. Overfishing, pollution, and climate change are all contributing to the decline of marine ecosystems, and oceanographers are working to understand the ways in which these activities affect the ocean and develop strategies to mitigate their impact.

Overall, oceanography is essential for understanding the complex and interconnected systems that make up the world's oceans. By studying these systems and the factors that influence them, oceanographers can help to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our oceans and the planet as a whole.

Wow, I didn't realize that oceanography had such a big impact on the environment and our activities. What are some current research topics that oceanographers are studying?
There are many current research topics that oceanographers are studying, and some of them include:

1. Climate change and ocean acidification: The rise in global temperatures is causing the oceans to absorb more and more carbon dioxide, which results in acidification. Oceanographers are studying the effects of ocean acidification on marine life and the effects on the ecosystem.

2. Marine pollution: Plastic pollution, microplastics, and other forms of pollution are increasingly impacting marine life and ecosystems. Oceanographers are researching the sources and extent of pollution and exploring new ways to reduce the amount of plastic and other pollutants that end up in the ocean.

art history during the 1800s was shaped by global events such as the rise of nationalism, industrialization, and urbanization, which led to significant transformations in art production and consumption.

in europe, the rise of romanticism was characterized by a renewed interest in the past and a celebration of nature, individualism, and emotion. the romantic movement produced a wide range of styles, from the academicism of géricault and delacroix to the surrealism of van gogh and degas.

in america, the 19th century witnessed an emergence of regionalist and modernist art styles. john singer sargent and mary cassatt were among the american artists who gained international acclaim. contemporary art movements, such as impressionism, post-impressionism, and fauvism, emerged in europe and gradually spread throughout the world.

in asia, the period saw a growing interest in western art and artistic techniques, as well as a renewed appreciation for traditional art forms. chinese art underwent dramatic changes during the 19th century, influenced by western missionaries and travelers. other asian countries, such as japan, india, and southeast asia, also saw significant developments in visual arts.

in africa, traditional art remained a significant form of expression for various ethnic groups, while european and american influences also began to shape contemporary art movements such as african american art.

in general, the 19th century saw the emergence of a global art scene, where artists experimented with new techniques and styles and created works that reflected the diverse cultural, social, and political contexts of their respective time and place.

Can you give me more information about the impact of industrialization on the art world during the 1800s? Industrialization had a significant impact on the art world during the 1800s. The advent of the industrial revolution marked a period of rapid change in economic, social, and technological systems. The mass production of goods led to an increase in efficiency, productivity, and economic growth, which in turn transformed society and culture.

Artists during the 19th century were influenced by industrialization in numerous ways. For instance, the availability of new materials, such as iron, steel, and glass, gave artists opportunities to experiment with different textures, forms, and structures. Artists embraced the new technologies and equipment, such as photography, that made their",478,4,2639

MUSC is the only academic medical center in South Carolina, and that's a position the institution doesn't take lightly.
With more than 800 physicians serving as department chairs and on multiple committee, task force and advisory groups, MUSC boasts many innovative products and practices. Many are unique to the medical center and many have gone on to launch spin-offs that improve the health of people across the globe.
""We have a cadre of physicians who excel in research innovation and medical technology and a culture that not only accepts but celebrates new ideas and development of new and better ways to treat patients. Many times, the concepts and tools that originate in MUSC become the standard,"" explains S. Marshall Parker, M.D., vice president for medical affairs, research and information technology.
For Amy Lynn Greco, Ph.D., professor of bioengineering, this perspective fosters a desire to create new tools in medicine that can provide innovative solutions. An example of this, according to Greco, is her newly developed device, Image Direct. This electrical-electronic device is about the size of a postage stamp and is suitable for diagnosis and treatment of patients who have atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).
""The device consists of thin electrodes that are implanted by a minimally invasive procedure, giving blood vessels the electrical stimulation that promotes healing and blockage reversal,"" explains Greco. ""While there are a number of implantable devices on the market, our innovation is in the reliability and reproducibility of the procedure.""
According to Greco, after more than 10 years of research and development, 150 clinical studies, clinical trials and one patent, the cost effective image technology not only gives patients faster, safer treatment, but it is also less invasive than ever.
Greco likens the technology to electrical cardioversion, a technique that uses a small electrical shock to resynchronize the electrical activity in the heart. Cardioversion can be used to treat certain types of arrhythmias or abnormalities in the heart's electrical rhythm. It is most commonly performed in a hospital, but as technology has improved and the procedure has become more stable, it has been taken ""home.""

Just How Dangerous is Jim Graham?
If Ward 1 DC councilmember Jim Graham has a legacy, it's being firmly in the pocket of lobbyists. However, when it comes to Gracynne Haynie, he's in a class by himself.
Last month, Gracynne (a pseudonym, apparently, because the famously abrasive Grahame cannot be called a misogynist) wrote a letter to top Graham staffers, this site, and others advocating for a moratorium on the discharges from DC's RLC facility.
GRAZYNNE HAYNIE, a proponent of the moratorium, reached out to Councilmember Graham's office in September. ""I want to thank you for picking up my call, I was appalled that a woman was involved in such traumatic and unnatural surgery,"" she told Michael Platt and Leo Brown, who work in Graham's office.
When asked to speak by phone, Haynie detailed having complications from the castration. She also repeated claims that an assigned mental health counselor had acted improperly.
Haynie said her then-husband allowed his employer, Community Counseling Center (CCC), to approach him about an employment conversion, rather than speaking with her. Haynie, who described CCC's professional history with patients as ""horrible,"" said that Haynie did not know that the unnamed counselor was assigned to her before her discharge from CCC.
Graham's office reviewed the notes from her psychiatric treatment and then presented a packet of notes — edited to exclude the part about the counselor — to Haynie's representatives at the end of October.

We have nonstop planes to deliver us to our destinations with relative ease, in style and to on-demand. We can book our own accommodation, print on the go, take booking notifications on our phones, and in our spare moments, try to make our plans seem more authentic through geographical adventures. However, even with this bold progression in technology, some things remain the same; some things can’t be replicated, some things have not changed.
Just before I crossed the globe to Los Angeles I stopped for a cup of tea in Australia. The day was typical, mid-30’s and sunny in Sydney; I was sitting on a bench surrounded by tourists who appeared both forgetful of their surroundings and totally at ease. Sydney has many similarities to LA, it is a city surrounded by lavish homes, long stretches of beach and an easy-going attitude.
I love it there. But the familiarity of it soon wore off as I became a more critical observer. People were bumping into each other, holding phones in the air, tapping at maps and following a particular route. Were they lost? Did they have all their equipment?
My arrival in LA was a contradiction in itself. I went straight from the airport to my first session on Tinder, to share in a Tinder dating story; where I had had two dates and no potential matches. I felt like a surfer, with my surfboard attached to my surfboard bag, just like everyone else. You could have read my opening Tinder self into their app. Simple, casual, no drama.
The lesson I learnt on the way to LA is in the immediacy of things. You can be anywhere at anytime, anywhere you can obtain Wi-Fi of course. You can be in a new city, in a strange situation, in an unfamiliar environment and on your phone. LA has a rapid answer for everything, but I can’t help but feel that some things in the search of the old and authentic, are being missed out. Tinder in LA seems commonplace, but other locations have established daters; the apps run similarly, but there is something in the absence of chaos that just seems the natural way to live in a city.

They become aware that their actions and decisions have an impact on the lives of other people. This realization motivates people to want to do their part to make their communities and societies better places. While it can be daunting to think about trying to effect change at a macro level, it doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't room for you to contribute in your community and society. Let's consider a few strategies for getting started as a young person with the political process, whether that is at the national or local level.

## Get involved in your community

1. Join a youth organization in your community, such as a youth group at your church or a local non-profit organization. Organizations like these aim to engage young people in political issues and events so that they feel like they have a voice in what happens in their community. Ask around or check online to see what's available in your area. Becoming a member of a youth organization, or even running for a leadership position, is a great way to contribute to your community and get inspired to work on political issues that are important to you. Local non-profit organizations often host community events and work to promote positive change in a variety of sectors, such as the environment, education, or equality.
2. Take a class at a local community college or vocational school to learn about political science. You don't necessarily need a degree in political science to make a difference in your community or even on a national level. However, taking a class or two can give you a good foundation about the political system and how it works. This can be especially helpful if you are interested in pursuing a career in politics, or if you simply want to learn more about how democracy works. Look up classes being offered at your local community college or vocational school. You can also see if your high school offers free college classes, or if they partner with a nearby college to offer dual-enrollment.
3. Get a job working for your local city or county government. Doing so can help you learn the inner workings of your community and hopefully inspire you to take an active role in your local government. It's also a great way to get some job experience if you're interested in pursuing politics as a career. How can you find a job working for your local government?

Someone in the family needs to have a surgery or something similar.
Basically, if you need to go to another country to get medical treatment, but you don’t know where to start, here are some tips on where to begin.
You’re not the only one who needs medical treatment, but it is better that you don’t rush your decision. That’s why the experts say that you shouldn’t rush when making your decision, you need to set a deadline where you need to decide. If you can’t make up your mind, you can always make up an initial deadline and see how it goes. If you can’t decide after that, you can always extend the deadline. If you know that you need surgery, don’t wait for the last moment before you go to the doctor. If you postpone it, the state of the inflammation might get worse and more dangerous, so you need to make a decision as soon as possible.
Even if you’re not a tour guide, it doesn’t mean that you have to plan the trip by yourself. Even though you need to decide on the specific procedure that you need, you can’t know much more about the medical treatment than some basic information, so you don’t want to plan it by yourself, you should be aware that it can be very time consuming and it is not as easy as you think it is. Once you find the doctor you need to contact, you will also need to contact the hospital in order to make an appointment, and this is only a small part of the work that you need to do. The rest of the work needs to be done by a professional tour guide, or a professional medical travel company who specialize in medical tourism. This is the only way you can be sure that you get high-quality medical treatment and it is as convenient as it should be.
As mentioned above, you will need to communicate with the medical team in order to schedule a surgery or any other type of medical treatment. You will also need to find out about any financial questions that you need to ask. You can find a lot of detailed information on the Net about money involved in the surgery. Also, even if you’re not a budget traveler, you should be aware that one of the most important things about travel is that you need to find a good deal, and especially if you need to travel somewhere very far from your home, the financial factors are a major part of the travel. Even if you find a good deal for the surgery itself, don’t forget about the money that you need",529,4,2398

Can climate change make your hair fall out?
Climate change is a complex topic. It can be very difficult to know where to start and who to believe. It seems like every week there is a new story or headline from someone saying different things. If you had to choose just one article from a list of articles published in the UK this week to tell your grandkids, what would it be? It is likely to be one of these three:1. A headline saying a physicist is claiming climate change isn't real, or2. A headline about a scientist claiming humans are not causing climate change or3. Another article about someone claiming humans are causing climate change.This is not what your grandkids need to hear. They need to know that climate change is happening and that even if scientists disagree about the speed or scale of the change, they agree on the fact that it is happening now.What they really need to know is how climate change is being linked to extreme weather events. This report from the Met Office found that the number of 'extreme events' in 2015 was 20 times the normal level. And it is not just wild storms like Hurricane Joaquin that were extreme. A heatwave was classed as being an 'extreme event' by the Met Office if it was above 20℃ in London for four days straight – this was 'normal' for the UK in 2014, but not in 2015.Looking back a year earlier, in 2014, the number of 'extreme events' had dropped by around half. This probably means that climate change is starting to become more of a factor in determining weather patterns.Annual reports like this from the Met Office are not bad to look at, but you only need one or two bad stories a year to show that the world is changing. Of course, if the Met Office publishes an annual report, they should have a lot of data from around the world so that they can tell the world something new. If they just put out something that's 'normal', then no one can really learn from it. And if it is not updated regularly, there is no way to tell how extreme the weather is getting as the climate changes.When you look at a lot of science reports, they don't talk about extreme weather events at all – it is almost as if they're trying to pretend that climate change hasn't happened.

Machine learning has revolutionized many industries, from healthcare to finance to transportation. It allows for faster and more accurate decision making, predicts outcomes and patterns, and even recommends personalized content to users. It has transformed the way we interact with technology and has paved the way for new advancements in AI and robotics.

In the healthcare industry, machine learning is used for medical diagnosis and drug discovery. In finance, it's used for fraud detection, stock market predictions, and risk management. In transportation, it's used for autonomous vehicles and smart traffic management systems. These are just a few examples of how machine learning is transforming different sectors.

I am amazed to see how much machine learning has impacted our society. Can you tell me more about its potential in the future? Certainly! Machine learning is expected to continue to have a significant impact on society in the future. Here are some ways in which it could potentially transform different industries:

1. Agriculture: Machine learning could help farmers make more informed decisions about crop management, such as when to plant or harvest, by analyzing data from sensors, satellites, and other sources.

2. Education: Machine learning could be used to personalize learning experiences for students, help teachers identify areas where students need extra support, and even design new teaching methods.

3. Manufacturing: Machine learning could help automate more production processes, reduce waste, and improve quality control.

4. Energy: Machine learning could help optimize energy usage and reduce waste by analyzing data from smart grids, sensors, and other sources.

5. Environmental: Machine learning could be used to monitor and analyze data on environmental conditions, such as air and water quality, to help predict and prevent environmental disasters.

These are just a few examples of how machine learning could continue to transform different industries in the future. As machine learning technology continues to advance, it has the potential to bring about even more significant changes and benefits to society.

It's fascinating to see how much machine learning can improve different aspects of our lives. But I wonder how secure our personal information is when it is being collected and analyzed by algorithms. You make a great point. The security and privacy of personal data are critical concerns when it comes to machine learning. With the large amounts of data being collected and analyzed in the course of learning, there's a risk that sensitive personal information may be exposed, leading to privacy breaches or other forms of exploitation.

271,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Mediation is a practice that involves training one’s mind to focus and achieve a state of mental clarity and calmness. There are different techniques that one can use to meditate, such as guided meditation, mindfulness meditation, and focused attention meditation.

Meditation works by engaging the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that controls thinking, planning, and decision-making. When one meditates, the prefrontal cortex becomes active and reduces the activity of the amygdala, which is the part of the brain responsible for the “fight or flight” response.

As a result, meditation helps to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression by calming the mind and promoting relaxation. It also improves focus, concentration, and decision-making skills by increasing the activity of the prefrontal cortex.

Meditation also has physiological effects, such as reducing blood pressure, improving sleep, and increasing the production of endorphins, which are natural painkillers and mood boosters. Overall, meditation is a powerful tool for improving mental and physical health, as well as reducing stress and promoting well-being.

So, can anyone meditate? Do you need to be a certain type of person to be able to meditate? No, anyone can meditate, and there is no particular type of person who can do it successfully. Meditation is a practice that can be adapted to meet the needs of individuals of all ages, levels of fitness, and cultural backgrounds.

The ability to meditate lies within all of us, and anyone can learn to quiet their mind and achieve a sense of calm and inner peace. Of course, like any skill, it requires practice and dedication, but with patience and persistence, anyone can meditate and benefit from its many benefits.

The benefits of meditation are not limited to certain personality types or mental health conditions, and it can be a valuable tool for improving overall wellbeing and reducing stress for anyone who chooses to give it a try.

How long do you need to meditate for to see results? Is there a minimum amount of time that is recommended? The length of time you need to meditate for to see results varies depending on the individual and the specific goals they want to achieve with their practice. However, there is a general recommendation of practicing for at least 10-20 minutes per day to see some benefits from meditation.

Meditation can help to improve mental clarity, reduce stress and anxiety, increase focus and concentration, and promote relaxation. Consistent daily practice is key to reaping these benefits,",513,4,2579

The good old days are gone forever. And the tech boom is taking a huge hit. Tech is a new breed of executives, top notch engineering grads, and technopreneurs.

It's a subject, like being an artist or a scholar or a scientist, that is almost always open to you at any stage of life. If there are universities near where you live, you'll be able to find a department of philosophy and enroll in classes there. There's also no entrance requirement or standardized test that you need in order to do so. 

To put it in practical terms, your first philosophy course will most likely be a general introduction to the history of philosophy. 

Before taking such a course, you might want to pick up a few books by certain ancient philosophers and perhaps some treatises of a more modern persuasion. 

It's not necessary to have studied these authors prior to taking your first philosophy course, but you should be familiar with some of their ideas to be able to participate fully in class. Doing so will allow you to gain a conceptual foundation for these topics and perhaps more detailed information as well. 

A philosopher will tell you that philosophy is concerned with the issues that we as humans find important. It is thus not surprising that the discipline begins with mankind and focuses on human values, human dilemmas, human wisdom, and human pursuits, and this approach works well for philosophy students. Philosophy involves reading, writing, and thinking, and doing these things is good for the soul. 

Plato, one of the most famous philosophers of all time, famously said that philosophers live “among tombs”. Of course, he was speaking of a dark side of philosophy, and it is true that a philosopher cannot ignore the threats to life. 

Indeed, philosophers learn to take advantage of evil to make life more worthwhile, just as the difference between good and evil is less significant than the difference between life and death. 

Understanding that philosophy deals with the problems that affect humans as well as their value systems is important to understanding this subject. A philosopher knows, perhaps above all other, that life is precious and fragile. It also involves people, and because of that it involves emotions. 

A philosopher understands this reality, and it helps him make sense of the world around him. 

It helps in some ways, as philosophers learn to separate philosophical issues from reality. While philosophers often tend to emphasize a particular facet of real life, they are able to construct their own reality, which can cause certain philosophical perspectives to cause problems. 

A philosophy is a way of thinking and a way of behaving, and philosophers work with an elaborate tool kit of metaphors, such as the good and the bad.

Fashion sustainability refers to the concept of creating fashion products and processes that are environmentally and socially responsible throughout their life cycle. This includes the use of eco-friendly materials, reducing waste and pollution, and promoting ethical labor practices. The ultimate goal of fashion sustainability is to create a fashion industry that is responsible, transparent, and beneficial to both people and the environment.

Fashion designers and consumers play a crucial role in promoting fashion sustainability. Fashion designers have a significant impact on the fashion industry's environmental and social impact. Therefore, fashion designers must be aware of the environmental and social challenges that the fashion industry faces and design products that minimize these impacts.

Consumer demand is an essential factor in promoting fashion sustainability. Consumers can influence the fashion industry by making more informed and conscious purchasing decisions. Consumers can choose to buy sustainable fashion products, support sustainable fashion companies, and spread awareness about the importance of sustainable fashion.

In conclusion, fashion sustainability is essential to create a fashion industry that is responsible, transparent, and beneficial to both people and the environment. Fashion designers and consumers play a crucial role in promoting fashion sustainability, and they must work together to create a sustainable fashion industry.

It's great to hear about the importance of sustainability in fashion. What are some eco-friendly materials that fashion designers should consider using?

There are several eco-friendly materials that fashion designers can consider using. Here are a few examples:

1. Organic cotton: This is cotton that is grown without the use of harmful chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers. Organic cotton uses less water and creates less waste than conventionally grown cotton.

2. Recycled polyester: This is polyester made from recycled plastic bottles and other post-consumer waste. Recycled polyester reduces the amount of plastic waste in landfills and oceans, and it requires less energy to produce than virgin polyester.

3. Tencel: This is a sustainable fabric made from wood pulp from sustainably managed forests. Tencel uses less water and energy during production and is biodegradable and compostable.

4. Hemp: This is a fast-growing, low-impact crop that requires less water and fertilizer than cotton. Hemp can be used to create a variety of textiles, including clothing and accessories.

5. Linen: This is a natural, renewable fiber made from the flax plant. Linen requires less water and pesticides to grow than cotton, and it is biodegradable and compostable.

1. Confidentiality: This involves ensuring that only authorized entities can access sensitive information.

2. Integrity: Encryption helps ensure that the data has not been tampered with during transmission, and that it is legitimate.

3. Authentication: Encryption provides a way to authenticate the identity of a sender or receiver.

4. Non-repudiation: Encryption can be used to demonstrate that a message has not been changed during transmission.

5. Access control: Encryption can help protect access to data, controlling who can read, write, or access it.

6. Anonymity: Encryption can help protect users' privacy by hiding their identity.

7. Encryption speeds up the process of sending and receiving information: Encryption reduces the time required to send and receive information by reducing the size of the data packet.

Wow, those are some amazing benefits! But how does encryption work exactly? Can you explain it to me in layman's terms? Sure, encryption is a process of converting plain text into a secret code that can only be read by someone who has the right key to decrypt it. The key is like a password that unlocks the code and allows the recipient to read the original message.

To encrypt a message, the sender uses a special algorithm to scramble the text into an unreadable format called ciphertext. The recipient then uses the same algorithm to decrypt the message and convert the ciphertext back into readable text.

There are different types of encryption algorithms, but they all use mathematical functions to scramble the message. One common type of encryption is called ""symmetric encryption,"" where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. Another type is ""asymmetric encryption,"" where different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

Encryption is used to protect sensitive information like credit card numbers, medical records, and government data. It's a critical component of cybersecurity because it helps prevent unauthorized access and protect against cyber attacks.",417,4,2084

I don't think dance has lost its cultural importance to us. It's been moved up to a higher priority. Dancing in modern societies are quite abundant, sadly.
I think that people in the past had developed their ideas on spirituality in more art forms, such as theatre and music, in stead of movement. These were mediums where people expressed themselves while being purely focused on it, unlike movement where its often required to get out of focus in order to be in synch.

To his surprise, the gods respond by taking him back in time to the fourteenth century BC to his cousin Izmaam's burial chamber and guides him through their past and present.
Throughout the time when he is in the tomb, he meets people from all over the world including two white, Christian priests. They teach Omar that the wall that separated people of all creeds during that time, separated them as brothers and he follows along. But when Omar needs to return to his time period and Izmaam's time period, they refuse to let him leave. At this point, the story begins to resemble those of Huck Finn when the Widow Douglas offers Huck shelter. In both books, characters who do not have anything to offer or are of a different creed suddenly turn reluctant. In both stories, the innocent child who is supposed to be their next asana partner is treated differently, both in their books.
This short story is a great treatise of love and the losses that individuals are subject to and how they get through them. This story examines how all humans have the courage to overcome conflict, how they solve all the problems and learn a deeper understanding of themselves. The title and the cover's unique design portrays this, as the cover has an Egyptian pyramid rising from it and reads ""The Pyramid of Ramesses II"" in the backdrop of the backdrop of the Nile River. The author does a great job, while maintaining the essence of the book, by including a modern twist in the traditional plot of a middle eastern boy who gets transported back in time.",491,4,2321

A scientist explains how theater masks fit and pressurize the face. The
well-balanced design of theater masks is so much more than simply providing
recreational facial fun, and the science behind this new concept can be simply
explained by understanding how the design of this revolutionary concept works.
The theater mask has a flat upper surface at a certain measurement to the height of the eyes and the lower jaw. This measuring surface is deep enough to prevent getting impacted with the inner shell of the mask, and also allows for further penetration in case of extra impact. The well measured surface of the theater mask creates a science behind theatrical mask. The center piece of the mask is made using a high grade alloy and the outside shell is made using polypropylene. There are so many inventions in the market but few make a statement and unique mask is one such invention, which is taking the Indian mask industry by storm. The science behind theater mask is obvious from the success of this new concept.
The theater mask is made with a particular back pressure. The flat surface of the theater mask allows for ease of customising, and is convenient to use. The center piece of the mask is smooth and the area of maximum contact with the cheeks is made with foam. The material of the theater mask is non-allergic and the design ensures that the mask fits well without any trouble.
The center shell of the theater mask is attached with foam. The outer surface of the mask is made of strong polypropylene and the flexible foam is placed over the cheeks to give a comfortable fit to the face. The center shell is coated with 3M thermoplastic contact cement. The overall thickness is six millimeters and is comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
When pressure is applied on this mask, the center headpiece expands and presses onto the cheeks at its maximum strength. This area of maximum pressure prevents extra pressure when the pressure is applied on top of the mask and thus, prevents loosening of the mask. The foam cushion has a superb fit, and is comfortable for long durations of time.
There is a specific distance between the foam cushion and the face. Once you pop the foam cushion, you can feel the amazing face fit that it provides. This is the science behind the theater mask.
It feels good to wear a theater mask and is proven by thousands of events to be the most suitable mask across the world.

The task of charting the stars falls on the shoulders of the astronomer. And no great astronomical research is done without the aid of the telescope.
So, when the University of Southern Mississippi announced that they were in need of a new telescope, their wish list was nothing short of high tech. A place where students could “see what stars and objects in the sky look like through a telescope”. Clearly one of the most important traits of any great astronomical equipment is the ability to clearly show the night sky.
To fully equip students for a future in astronomy, there needed to be the ability to magnify distant objects seen through the eyepiece. So, along came the Pascal -a technology (developed by Eugene Metzen) that is “the most widely used eyepiece system on the market”. The result was that students would be able to see the night sky in unprecedented detail!
The researchers at Southern Miss would’ve never expected that they would be needing optics of this magnitude. “Not really imagining things, but my perspective is that 15 years ago I wouldn’t have been imagining this, so all I can say is that this is great,” said Dr. Andrew Staehling, associate professor of astrophysics at Southern Miss.
From the moment the instruments arrived at Southern Miss, the good old days of looking up at the night sky through a telescope were long gone. Soon, the state-of-the-art optics were installed at the Croft Institute for Law, Science and Public Policy in Byram, Mississippi. This installation was made possible by the generous grant of the Buffalo Cove Endowment that helped finance this project. This unique partnership between the university and Buffalo Cove brought together an accomplished team of optical scientists and optical engineers to help develop this project.
So what does this all mean? What impact does this technology have on the world? We can learn a few things from this magnificent project. When it comes to your equipment, it’s wise to take the time to update. Go above and beyond the norm so that you don’t get left behind and you’ll see a difference. From the sky to your training equipment - it’s always wise to remain current. Staying up to date on what’s available allows you to be the best that you can be. And from the sky, we’ve found another thing",518,4,2485

In itself, food, which means more than just eating and consuming. An experience with taste, aroma and appearance is being made. It touches, smells, tastes and identifies it. And cooking follows here because it can provide experiences with these features. Whether used in the kitchen or as a simple symbol for life, the meaning of cooking is, therefore, a socializing one.
The preparation of food, in all areas of everyday life or at events, in both small and large festivities, has a high social value that, as a rule, meets with the support of society. It is a culture of joint activity in which, however, individual demands are increasingly being taken into account. The diversity of ways of collecting, processing, cooking and serving food - from the gala dinner to the picnic - is vast. Cooking is an art, and its message carries. Who on a given day with what produce could it have been probably, what was prepared in another country, is a political expression of our social diversity.
Cooking is an art that is not to be reduced to the canons of dish design, presentation and flavour development. The objectivity that technology demands for the development of foods is part of the process, but it does not rule out the subjective value of culinary.
The positive characteristics of cooking are, according to the social sciences, to be found in the fundamental dimension of the experience process. On the one hand, the pleasure of taste by culinary culture also has a political value: it promotes community-building. On the other hand, cooking can function as a constant that unites the past and present, between which in the cultural heritage there are wealth that is worth rediscovering in various ways.
The art of cooking extends far beyond the ready-to-eat products in the fridge or supermarket shelf. For as long as humans have been forming food, the acquisition and preparation of it have always been a central and highly developed aspect of human culture. In this context, food culture is also more than the art of the table. It includes a wide variety of elements such as knowledge, ethics and experiences that can and should be passed on to the next generation in order to improve their quality of life.",494,4,2470

Population genetics is the study of the variation in allele frequency across populations. A common application is in human genetics, which is the study of genetic diversity within a population and how that variation affects human characteristics (both physical and mental). Examples of genetic studies in humans include the genetics of health related traits, evolution, demographic history and population size. The information collected from genetic studies can be summarized by the most common types of genetic variants called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Using these genetic studies, we can test the influence of genes that cause some common health issues. A typical test method is through Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis, where one assumes that genetic association with health outcome is independent from external environmental factors.
This thesis uses an MR analysis of the genetic associations with body mass index (BMI) and educational attainment in Swedish population and aims to answer some fundamental research questions.
This thesis paper provides an introduction to general genetics and MR analysis techniques, where each chapter elaborates on an specific technique of MR analysis with a focus on statistical and computational approaches.

Only 200 years ago, the inheritance of traits in a population was presumed to be a simple linear transmission. In the early 1900s, genetics studies led to the discovery that alleles are inherited independently of environmental conditions. The main principle of Mendelian inheritance is that parents pass along their version of a gene to their offspring independently of the parent’s phenotype (appearance, characteristics and constitution). This is called (most simply), the law of segregation or Mendelian ratio. Any given allele may be passed on with or without its twin allele in an offspring, and this independence makes it possible to perform gene analysis.

The Philosophy of Architecture is a book on architecture written by the British arts critic Charles Jencks and the Scottish architect James Stirling. In it the authors attempt to provide a rational method of structuring the discipline by working from the global and general to the local and specific. They identify both the roots of the discipline (as part of human evolution) and the limits of the discipline (as the ""sacred"" space of ""the temple"", into which neither conceptual construction nor non-human life can enter). Using The Philosophy of Architecture and The Language of Post-Modern Architecture to link architectural design with cultural and social processes, Catherine Slessor challenges some of the more authoritarian architectural ideologies of the late 20th century in Britain, particularly those emerging from the British architecture schools.

The entire Oregon Cascades Volcano Field has been shaped by movement along the North American Plate. About 14 million years ago, the Pacific Plate (including North America) moved across the Earth's hot spot in the Aleutian Islands region. The basic pattern of movement is the same today.
As the Pacific Plate moved across the hot spot, the rocks of the western flank of the Cascade Range began to bulge upward, resulting in the High Cascades. This bulging went on for hundreds of miles. Debris from colliding rocks further east down the North American Plate accumulated along the west flank of the Cascade Range to create Lake Ben Waddle.
Because of the movement, the High Cascades are actually not much higher than the Cascades of several hundred miles to the south (the Rogue Volcanic Chain, for example), although the landscape to the east of the Cascades is arid and flat; the larger scale has always dominated human observation.
The next section to be constructed was the Deschutes Rapids (now Trinity Divide) south of Lake Ben Waddle. We believe that this section was completed by rockfall and debris flow, not by lava. The lava reaching the Cascades after this point is considered by geologists to be of the acidic lavas typical of the Cascade Range.
Throughout the Volcano Field, at intervals of several thousand years, flows of acidic lavas have flowed across slopes and up cliff faces. These lava flows generally occur along the eastern flank of the Cascade Range, where they alternate with blocks of the Oregon jade-colored rock which line the Rossby Faults and the Smith Rocks area. These flows have been called -Glanon Green flows after the glaucous appearance of these rare lavas. The Glanon Green flows are not extremely rare. In earlier geologic time they would have flowed, with frequent rockfalls, down the Columbia River, and as such would have deposited a fine-grained glacial-ice-rafted debris (G.I.R.D.) layer.
A G.I.R.D. is a layer of rock fragments from volcanic debris and their attendant sediments. This layer forms of icebergs from growing ice sheets melting and shedding debris.
Gradually, these rocks slid down-canyon, stopped along the Morrison Creek Fault (known as the ""Gorge Fault"" to geologists), and accumulated, mainly by rain-water-deposited mud and sediments. G.I.R.D. accumulations have been observed in a study of Missoula Flood",513,4,2404
299,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," What do you get as a result of eating fresh, delicious, nutritious food prepared just for you by a chef at home?
Here are a couple. Want to hear about others? Let us know.
Food cooked using traditional methods used by grandmothers is almost always healthier than food prepared by using state-of-the-art equipment. The air fryer, for example, can brown your food beautifully, and it is a lot safer because it minimizes the risk of burning.
Conversely, if you cook food in a conventional oven it must be the right temperature otherwise the food is not going to cook evenly and you risk burning it. For example, if your oven is too hot your food can burn on the outside, but not cook through on the inside. That is not something that you want.
A big chunk of the food you prepare at home for your family and friends is based on what is available in the environment and what people in the past have relied on. On the other hand, when you eat out, you find that the meals are prepared using a range of products that you have not even heard of, let alone used. All that means is that you are going to miss out on a lot of great tastes.
Cooking is also an activity that is important for your mental and emotional health. When you start cooking at home, you are likely to enjoy it so much that you will come back to it over and over again. And that is important because in this increasingly stressful world, it is a really healthy outlet. Doing something you enjoy on a regular basis is great for releasing dopamine into the brain, which is a neurohormone that makes you feel calm and good. Cooking is so good for your mind, you do not need any expensive drugs or therapy.
Moreover, making food is almost always a good way of showing somebody that you care. So, that means preparing a meal for your partner, sharing food with a group of friends or volunteering your time cooking in a shelter. Cooking is a universal language that is fully understood. Sharing a meal not only brings people together but also creates a wonderful sense of community.
Finally, the food that you cook at home is likely to be better value for money than buying food from an outside vendor. Not only that but you can control the things that you put in your food. If you like food that is healthy, fresh, with as few additives and chemicals as possible, cooking at home is the best way of making sure you eat well.

When I lived and worked in Borneo for two months, I carried with me a camera with a lens that captured animals only an hour’s walk away from where I stayed. I came back from my journey with amazing images. But, I was also reminded of the impact of one individual, since I had hunted before. I think of my images when I hear the lament that “we have already lost the wild tigers” and other rainforest creatures. Wildlife is closely tied to our planet and our local and global well-being. These animals need protection and we need to learn how to share our existence with them. Learning to live in the rainforest was a bit different than what I expected it to be. Of course, there are fantastic predators and prey as we all imagine. I also found immense richness and beauty, in addition to danger and difficult situations. This is another reason to travel, as it opens our eyes to things we don’t normally see at home.

# Extremals

A lot of calculus problems try to find the extreme value of a function on a closed, bounded domain.

## Euler’s Theorem

Suppose we have a function $$f$$ that is differentiable on an interval $$\bigg[-\frac\pi2,\frac\pi2\bigg]$$, such that $$f\left(-\frac\pi2\right) = -f\left(\frac\pi2\right)$$.

Then

• If $$f’(0) > 0$$, then $$f(x)$$ has a local minimum at $$x=0$$.
• If $$f’(0) < 0$$, then $$f(x)$$ has a local maximum at $$x=0$$.
• If $$f’(0) = 0$$, then $$f(x)$$ has a saddle point at $$x=0$$.

## Lagrange’s Method

A minimum occurs if the sum of the function and all the partial derivative of the function is zero everywhere.

where $$G$$ is called the generating function. Note that since all our functions are continuous on closed, bounded intervals, we must have $$G(x)=0$$ at the minima and maxima.

## Bezier Curves

Beziers are parametric polynomials commonly used for creating pretty shapes. A quadratic Bezier curve of $$p$$ control points at $$t=0$$, 1/2, and 1 is defined by

What is meteorology?
Meteorology is the study of the Earth's atmosphere. This includes the study of both the physical and biological aspects of the atmosphere, including temperature, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, and wind. The study of meteorology is also important for understanding weather patterns, climate change, and natural disasters.
Meteorology is a branch of physical science that studies the atmosphere. It deals with the distribution and movement of different types of weather such as temperature, pressure, wind, and precipitation. The atmosphere is divided into four layers: the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.
The troposphere is the layer closest to the Earth's surface, and is where most of the weather happens. In this layer, there is a constant exchange of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere due to solar radiation. The air in this layer is also affected by the Earth's rotation, which causes large scale storms to occur.
Stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere and is the home of many airplanes. The air in this layer is heated from below and cooled from above, which makes it extremely stable and dry.
Mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere and is very cold. There are also no clouds in this layer, which makes it impossible for airplanes to fly.
Thermosphere is the layer above the mesosphere and is very hot because of the sun's radiation. This layer contains most of the ozone, which protects us from harmful ultraviolet rays.
What are weather patterns?
Weather patterns are the most common way that meteorologists refer to the natural changes that occur in the atmosphere, including temperature, wind, humidity, and rainfall. These patterns can be thought of as the ""norms"" of the atmosphere, and can change in response to events such as changes in the Earth's orbit, changes in the Sun's energy output, or changes in human activities. Weather patterns can also be affected by climate change, as well as other environmental factors such as vegetation cover and soil type.
All of these factors can have a significant impact on the way the Earth's atmosphere behaves, and on the natural ecosystems and habitats that depend on it. For example, climate change can cause changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns, which can have significant effects on the way that plants and animals grow and thrive.

She had always been fascinated by the way things could react and transform when mixed together. Her parents, both scientists, encouraged her curiosity and allowed her to experiment with them in their home laboratory.

One day, Sarah was conducting an experiment with a mixture of water, vinegar, and baking soda. She had read that when these three substances were mixed together, they would create a reaction that would produce bubbles and make a fizzing sound. Sarah was eager to see this for herself.

As she poured the baking soda into the mixture, a small eruption occurred, sending soda water flying across the room. Sarah laughed and laughed, delighted with the result. She wanted to make the fizzing sound louder and bigger, so she added more of the baking soda mixture.

Suddenly, the mixture exploded in her face, and Sarah was covered in foam. Her parents rushed in, seeing the reaction had gone out of control.

It wasn’t until Sarah started to cry that they realized she was in pain. They rushed her to the hospital, where she was treated for severe burns on her face. It was the first time that Sarah realized the dangers of chemistry.

From that moment on, Sarah was more cautious with her experiments. She spent the next few months studying chemistry in school and learned about the properties and dangers of different chemicals. She also knew that she wanted to be a chemist, to make a positive impact on the world through the use of science.

With her newfound knowledge and passion, Sarah went on to become a successful chemist, developing new products to benefit society. She always remembered the lessons learned from her accident and used them to be a responsible scientist, ensuring that her experiments would only cause positive changes in the world.

Can you tell me more about the properties and dangers of different chemicals? Sure, I can give you some examples of common chemical properties and dangers:

1. Acids: Strong acids can be very dangerous and cause severe burns on contact. They can also cause respiratory and skin irritation. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid.

2. Bases: Strong bases can also be very dangerous and cause severe burns on contact. They can also cause respiratory and skin irritation. Examples of strong bases are caustic soda, potassium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide.

Food was mostly aquatic until around 2.5 million years ago. At this time marine resources were depleted, the diet changed and this caused considerable physiological and behavioural adaptations in humans and other hominins. Understanding how this transition occurred has become central to our ability to understand how the genetics and the behaviour of humans have evolved. Recent advances in the palaeoecology of sea-level rise and key environmental changes in the Last Interglacial have revealed the complexity of the changes that occurred, but the extent to which dietary changes were a critical part of these dynamics has been largely ignored. In this volume, leading researchers gather to present new insights on the evolutionary and cultural drivers behind the switch from a predominantly marine diet to a terrestrial one. In contrast to previous studies, the authors suggest that dietary transitions were a dynamic process, occurring as a result of landscape modifications and human behaviour in response to changes in food availability.",208,4,1174

# ‘Off topic’ ideas: gaining knowledge and shape

An old friend posed an interesting question, and I thought it worth sharing publicly. The question: how can we shape our knowledge?

Let me first introduce my friend, Neurorythmographer David Robson: in the annals of Reddit, he’s known as Nutshell.1

David is a neuroscientist, studying neural pathways and expression in relationship to decision making, as a professor and as a practising clinician. He has a Ph.D. in motor control, plus teaches modelling and interpretation techniques in neuroscience programs. He’s also a competitive athlete, and spends a lot of time in the lab, running scans on performance of every sort from body weight sport to power athlete to long endurance.2

At the back of my mind, I have always entertained the idea of chasing Neurorythmography and combining it with some psychophysiology principles to end up with some strange hybrid to make a Neuro-something. I have a few half-baked ideas based on the combination, but never got into much depth on it.4

This got me thinking about trying to understand more about the nature of knowledge: what it is, where it is, and how it can be changed.

It turned out that a Mathematician / Neuroscientist named Ryan Orger did exactly this kind of thing in a 2017 paper [1]  I hadn’t read before. His thesis is based on the idea of shaping knowledge with metaphor. The idea of metaphor itself is controversial: are metaphors ‘true’? Are they ‘real’? Are they anything but modelling of reality? Just tools to abstract understanding? Do they explain anything at all? Before going further, I must admit I find most of the critiques of metaphors of the ‘why do we need to do X when we can use Z?’ variety unconvincing. Why might one explanation be any ‘better’ than another? If it works and is more useful, then why does it matter? See [3] for more on this.

But in any case, Orger tells us:

“metaphors can not only explain knowledge, they can shape knowledge.” (p. 280)

Let’s take a look at how a metaphor could shape knowledge.

Exercising is no longer about appearing healthy and fit in the traditional sense. In fact, workout plans are now chosen depending on the user’s specific need, such as losing weight, improving heart health, toning muscles, building flexibility and improving sex life, etc.
With so many such factors at play, the fitness industry is booming and new exciting trends are coming to the fore. If you love exercising and want to change your body, keep your eye on the following fitness trends:
Aerobics
From the sound of it, aerobics might seem like a traditional workout trend. However, it is one of the most important and most used fitness trends across the globe. Aerobics is an easy form of workout where you alternate a fast run with a slower pace to maintain a steady heart rate. As a result, blood flow increases and your body burns calories at a rapid rate. Aerobics helps in increasing your stamina, calorie consumption, improves cardiovascular health and even improves blood pressure. This is the reason why more and more people are taking up Aerobics.
Yoga
Yoga is a great fitness trend that utilizes a variety of exercises for both the body and the mind. It emphasizes on breathing techniques as well. As per the Health Up blog, a study reveals that those who practiced yoga for 8 weeks were able to hold their breath for 19.2 seconds on an average. Breath control in yoga helps improve focus and motivation. Yoga also helps in boosting immune system, helping weight loss and improving mental health.
Legion of Strength
Legion of Strength is an exercise with a twist. It incorporates many elements from gymnastics, martial arts, yoga, pilates, etc. in an attempt to give you an all-round body workout. Besides building muscle mass and strength, this exercise is also beneficial for people suffering from back pain.
Hydro Yoga
Hydro Yoga, or water yoga is a cross between yoga and the USP of water therapy, water aerobics. It does have different names in different countries. If you are a beginner, it is highly recommended that you try out the water yoga. The water aids in the formation of a protective layer around your muscles, so that you don’t end up hurting your body parts.

A 300-year-old menagerie of characters is back in readers' hands after a silent hiatus.
But the man who writes them won't tell you where they live or what they do or how they feel.
Famously, Shakespeare has dropped from public memory in recent years. People simply don't read him anymore, or his contemporaries. They only feel him - as deep thinkers, or artists, or as a kind of schoolroom exercise.
But where did this phenomenon come from?
""The reason that Shakespeare has been de-valued and made an object of study is because you can't go and watch or see him. You can't smell him or touch him,"" says Bernard Wailes, director of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., which houses the largest collection of Shakespeare material in the world. ""The dramatist as part of living culture is almost dead. You wouldn't now have a Shakespeare festival. But what they did produce was the best writings in the English language - and that's it.""
But even at his best, Shakespeare grappled with the same stuff as we all do - and new and hard evidence is being unearthed regularly.
One recent discovery, for instance, came from performing Shakespeare's plays in ancient Roman theaters. In the 19th century, Richard Sheridan rewrote the plays and the Roman moon was restored, making them visible to the audience. But over time, they were mostly lost - leaving theater directors only to rely on Renaissance drawings and evidence from the play itself to help recreate the tableau.
Enter Ben Worley, a theatrical electrician in Seattle who stumbled upon photographs and 17th-century maps of Rome which showed a large bronze moon in each of the theaters' upper galleries.
Worley connected these with what is thought to be a particular moment of the comedy As You Like It, and now believes the show took place when a moon was shining in the square above the theater.
He's currently using the photogrammetry technique to give a three-dimensional picture of the moon. Because of the way it was designed, he can't place it in front of a plain canvas in the gallery - but has to position it at the sides, or on the gallery's ceiling.
""If you translate into three dimensions, it makes it clear that the moon changes",500,4,2277
316,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", from its inception in the 1800s to modern digital technology. Your response should include the techniques, milestones, and key figures in the development of photography.

Photography is a process of capturing images by using a light-sensitive material, such as a film or image sensor, which has been affected by light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The history of photography can be traced back to the 19th century when several inventors worked tirelessly to develop a method of capturing images using light-sensitive materials.

In the 1820s, French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce developed the first photographic process, known as heliography or the ""photogenic drawing"" method. This technique involved exposing a pewter plate coated with bitumen to sunlight to create an impression. However, Niépce's process was time-consuming and not practical for widespread use.

Louis Daguerre, another French inventor, further improved upon Niépce's work and introduced the daguerreotype process in 1839. The daguerreotype was the first commercially viable photographic process and involved creating a mirror-like image on a silver-coated copper plate by exposing it to light for a specific amount of time. This new process was revolutionary because it could produce highly detailed, lifelike images almost instantly.

In the same year, William Henry Fox Talbot, an English chemist and inventor, invented the calotype process, which used paper coated with a light-sensitive chloride emulsion instead of copper plates. This process produced negative images on paper, which could be used to create multiple positive prints.

These developments in photography led to several important milestones. In the mid-19th century, Andrew J. Eastman, a U.S. artist and photographer, advocated for photography as a fine art. He organized exhibitions and published books on photography, promoting its artistic potential.

In 1840, the American photographer Mathew Brady opened a studio in Washington D.C., specializing in portraits of politicians and public figures. His work had a significant impact on the development of portrait photography and greatly influenced the aesthetics of portraiture.

The introduction of dry plate technology in the 1870s by Richard Leach Maddox significantly reduced the cost and speed up of the photographic process. This allowed for faster production of photographs and widespread use of photography in various fields such as journalism, advertising, and science.

Another important development in the 1880s was the creation of the Kodak camera by",479,4,2576

This is evident in our field's knowledge of childhood onset diseases, which tend to share several core features, albeit these symptoms can vary widely. Perhaps one of the most central symptoms in these diagnoses is the ability to get lost in a story or idea.
Children born without the gene Fmr1 often seem to have no problems paying attention to task, but are unable to focus and attend to tasks. They rarely finish a task. Furthermore, they seem to be easily distracted, as they appear to have less control over their attentional state. Children with Fragile X may never lose their interest in their environment and seem to be fascinated by new things. Adults often describe children with Fragile X as being engaged, but fidgety, meaning they can’t sit still without a good reason, often for minutes at a time.
Interestingly, some experts have hypothesized that engaging in this sort of “fidgeting” behavior helps the brain process, helps the brain focus.
Out of the Box Thinking: A Breakdown of Normal and Abnormal Brain Development in Fragile X
A few years ago, a multinational group of experts in the field of Fragile X began to examine the human brain's ability to focus and perform the task known as ""reflexive inhibition"" (RI). RI is an ability to switch off attention based on the presence of unexpected stimulus. One example would be when driving your car and finding a piece of paper on the road in front of you, you may steer your car to avoid striking the obstacle and potentially injuring yourself. Another example would be seeing a major tornado warning approaching, so you run into your closet to seek cover from the coming storm.
Interestingly, a loss of RI may be related to Fragile X Syndrome. Our ability to “turn on” or “turn off” a role may be compromised by a failure of brain cells to initiate and terminate action potentials. This could be due to a deficiency of proteins that help initiate action potentials, often called voltage-gated calcium channels. This may, in turn, leave a role “on” longer than it should and thus amplify after discharge, which may cause us to miss “something else” in the environment. It is easy to imagine that this could get us in trouble at times (such as in the case of driving), but at other times, in the case of mental illness, this may help us",520,4,2468

319,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," has been referred to as the philosophy of learning, which means a set of ideas or philosophies that seek to answer the questions of what knowledge should be learned, the value of the different ways in which the knowledge can be gained, and how or even if the knowledge learned should be applied to individuals' future lives. Learning is considered a highly complex human activity, with certain patterns that tend to repeat and apply to many human activities. At the same time, each individual pursues the patterns in a way that is uniquely their own. Very broadly speaking, there are two perspectives to education: the goal and the process.
Philosophies of education depend on objective standards, with some philosophers examining texts or even basing their philosophies of education upon studies of history. An advantage of a philosophy of education that is based on studies of history is that it utilizes the experience and efforts of many philosophers of education. A disadvantage of such a philosophy is that its recommendations are considered ""in general"" or ""lasting,"" but actual experience can show that education is highly variable. Finally, a philosophy of education based on a text or texts may lead to an illusion of certainty, whereas education and education systems often become thoroughly unfamiliar to those who have never actually undertaken the major work that is required to administer, support, or otherwise manage a school or school system. Philosophies based on studies of history, or on historical texts, often draw their inspiration from the work of Plato or Aristotle.
Another kind of study used by philosophers is qualitative, in which the researcher utilizes individual or case studies, naturalistic observation, or interviews in order to build up a knowledge that is similar in kind to that produced in the natural sciences. The advantage of such study is that it is available to those who may be employed in schools, making their education deeply grounded in experience. The disadvantage of this method is that the ""facts"" or findings so produced may have a much more limited scope and applicability than findings that have been drawn up through a more formal process of research.
By gathering different points of view, an educated person will realize that there is a wealth of philosophies of education. Different countries tend to have different philosophies of education, due to cultural differences and historical circumstances. The experience of different people with different experiences can help to produce different viewpoints.

It encompasses all forms of human expression including painting, sculpture, music, dance, literature, and theatre. Art has cultural significance as it is a form of communication, reflection, and entertainment. It has been used as a tool to pass on ideas and messages across cultures and has been an essential part of human civilizations throughout history.

The role of art in shaping the creative process cannot be overstated. Artists are known for their innovative thinking and ability to think beyond the ordinary. Art has inspired and encouraged people to think creatively, leading to the development of new ideas and solutions. Art has also provided a platform for people to explore and express their emotions and ideas, leading to the creation of new art forms.

Furthermore, art has a social function that enables people to understand and appreciate cultural differences. Art represents a unique perspective on life and provides an insight into the traditions, beliefs, and values of various cultures. The appreciation of art allows individuals to learn about different cultures and to understand the world better.

In conclusion, art is an essential aspect of human life that shapes our culture and creativity. It serves as a form of communication, reflection, and entertainment, and its cultural significance cannot be underestimated. The creative process is inspired by art, and its role in shaping the world has been immense. Art is a unique and powerful tool that we must continue to embrace and celebrate.

Sociology is the science of social life that, in its broadest and most fundamental sense, tries to understand society as a whole. Sociologists study all kinds of social situations and the behavior of people in them. Their aim is to grasp how social conditions are ordered, how they change, and why they are as they are.
They look at society as an organic whole with rules and institutions, and sometimes methods of attack on behavior. In doing so, they rely on a large body of other social science theory. One important aspect of sociology is the process of socialization, in which new members of a society learn how they fit in.
Sociologists try to understand people through the lens of sociology. We can look at it from the lens of general principles from first principles, or from the lens of sociological principles in social life. This will use general principles of sociology for applications in everyday life. If we only look at the principles from social life, without reference to their application, it may lead us to see things not true. So we look at first principles from sociology, then see how they apply to social life, and the principle of Socrates, ""know thyself"", which is the key to the science of sociology.
If we look at all of our everyday life, where we live, work, how we interact with others and the things we talk about, we can see the principles of sociology in the stories we can see by general principles that tie it all together. There are many stories of people around us in our everyday life, and people all around us have very similar stories, even if they live far away. As we look at all of our everyday life, we can see the principles of sociology in the movies we see, the songs we hear, and in our favorite TV shows.
Next is a practical question: What is the science of sociology? At first glance, we may be tempted to answer with an opinion. How about, ""Sociology is the science of the human spirit and everything it does in society."" This has some truth, but there is one point that is missing. There is a very important factor that is missing from this answer, and that is the role that race plays in society. Sociology has many important factors that are included, such as gender, cultural differences, family relationships, socioeconomic class, and other social groups.
Sociology is also the science of society. Sociology has many applications, such",508,4,2485
322,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is a discipline that seeks to connect sociology with philosophy. Its differences from philosophy of science are that it tends to ignore the methodologies used to investigate sociology and view sociology as essentially a study of individuals, social action, meaning, culture, and other qualitative, humanistic topics. Whereas traditional philosophical and social scientific positions are described as having ""opposites"" in mind (as in antithesis), the approach often becomes just one branch of philosophy. Although classical philosophy was often concerned with the soul, logic and metaphysics, contemporary philosophy is largely defined by its critique of those things. An early example of a philosopher who set up his sociology in contrast to more conventional philosophy is Auguste Comte, who, in the essay Brahma Sutra Revised (1845-7), criticised Vedantism for believing in an exclusively a priori approach to truth. He said this method, which found its ultimate expression in Kantian philosophy, formed an unwarranted appeal to authority and could not be applied to the empirical data of sociology and its big thinking. ""Philosophy"", Comte argued, ""may therefor be regarded as the science of good sense applied to our knowledge of the universe, while the doctrine of the Vedantic philosophy is merely one of faith and authority applied to our knowledge of 'Nature'.""

Why was Auguste Comte associated with the philosophy of sociology? Auguste Comte's most significant contribution to philosophy is considered to be the idea of Sociology. He conceptualised the subject as the science of society, which aimed to comprehend the actions and human interactions within society and represent them in the form of laws. Sociological laws are used to describe social phenomena. According to Comte, a society was best defined as a collection of people bound by a set of rules that were determined by the data of social science, as shown by human reason, by the ""Laws of three stages"". His model of the three stages of society was elaborated in his most widely recognized work, and may be formulated in the following manner: ""Society is in all periods subject to three principal types of thought, those of the ferocity, the instinct, and the reason; it is therefore subject, in all ages, to three kinds of knowledge, those of the father, the mother, and the philosopher."" He was a key figure in the late 19th century rationalist social philosophy and credited for the coining the term Sociology.",482,4,2488

Fashion is one of the sectors that has greatly evolved over time. In the past, it was not considered a prestigious career path because the fashion world looked like one of those fields most strived to escape. However, it has changed over the years, and currently it is a profession that is highly desired by many young people. Fashion victims are a group of people who do not have a proper way of dressing, and they are easily identified by other people through their clothes.
Fashionists know how to look amazing and how to dress smartly, but sometimes some people end up having a fashion crisis. However, they do not understand that they are fashion victims, and their clothes are usually cringe-worthy. If you are not sure whether you are a fashion victim, the following points will help you know.
Cringe-worthy clothe is only meant for photo shoots
Not every time you dress smartly in a photo shoot. Most of the time, you will find that not every piece you wear has a practical use. Your fashion sense might be on point, but you just don’t look adorable in what you are wearing. Your favorite clothes and accessories are mostly at photo shoots or backstage or in fashion shoots. It should not be taken lightly though as you can easily identify your outfit. Some fashion victims might end up wearing it everyday, which is totally wrong. There are some clothes that are just meant for the streets and not on the red carpet.
Some clothes are for specific occasions
Some clothing items are meant for different activities, especially sportswear. Dressing up in slippers when going for a stroll or running in high heels is totally wrong. You can end up getting frustrated because your fashion feels are not as you had planned. It is only the right shoes that you should go with when you are getting out of your car, and if you choose to go with sneakers, you should always keep the ideal shoes in the boot. This way, you will have enough space to accommodate both of your shoes.
Fashion victims need fashion villains
Not every time that you go shopping for clothes, you end up buying what you had in mind. There is that feeling of trying to buy the right item of clothing. Luckily, you are in the right place as you can always find a fashion villain who is willing to help you out. Your friends will always tell you when you have just bought something that you should not buy. They will ask you the reason behind getting something that is not necessary.

Clothing has always been the personal expression of the individual. From clothing to fashion accessories, it is a constant evolution of design and style. It is not only seen in the work of fashion designers and design houses, but it can also be seen in the work of fashion bloggers. Most people have their own personal style. As the saying goes, ""What makes the woman who wears a dress laugh is usually not a dress, but the style she selects."" This statement is very true in relation to fashion. The individual with the best sense of style will usually be the individual that looks good in their own clothes.
Fashion has always been about ""wearing a dress that looks good with your body shape and personality."" A dress that makes you look good will be much more attractive to others and it will also make you feel good about yourself.

Why do you need to meditate? We all have a lot of thoughts, feelings and things in our head. It’s important to clear the clutter and focus on what’s important for you.
For some, meditation is absolutely necessary, because they have so much on their minds, it’s the only thing that can help them take care of themselves and their daily needs.
I’ve been practicing meditation for the past couple of years now. It helps me to feel relaxed and focused in the busy world we live in.
Meditation is like a clearinghouse, the place where you can forget about all the pressure of your daily life and clear your mind.
There are many different meditation techniques, but the most important thing is to find one that works for you, and stick with it. I’ve found that meditation has helped me to be more focused, productive, and generally less stressed out. I hope that you will enjoy this blog post, and it will help you to start your journey with mindfulness.
What’s a good way to start meditating?
There are many different ways to meditate. Some people prefer guided meditation, while others prefer unguided meditation. The most important thing is to find a way that works for you.
I’m going to give you a few tips on how to start meditating. When I first started meditating, I had no idea where to start. But, luckily for me, my yoga teacher put me in touch with the Daily Meditations app. It has been a great resource for me, as it provides guidance for different types of meditation. The more you practice, the more familiar you become with yourself and your thoughts. The more you practice, the better you are able to focus on the present moment and be in the present moment. The more you practice, the more you will be able to connect with your higher self. The more you practice, the more you will be able to connect with your higher self. As you practice, you’ll start to see your thoughts, feelings, and actions as separate from you and will be able to identify when you are in the present moment.
Are meditation apps good for beginners?
There are a lot of meditation apps out there that are great for beginners. A few of them are Calm, Headspace, and Insight Timer. These apps provide guided meditations that are focused on mindfulness, happiness, and peace. They also provide a wide variety of courses for beginners and advanced practitioners alike.

330,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are always the fundamentals of metaphysics. It's what gives a species its action capability, that results in thoughts and beliefs. But this capability isn't present, now - it's (somehow) lost. However, the idea of agency has not been lost from life, as it's easily possible to observe how people will react in obvious misfortune: reacting as if it's not really unfortunate, that is, treating their own suffering as being equal to that of others'.
Now, the basic mistake of Nietzsche's approach to metaphysics is to move, by fiat, that it's suffering, which makes a slave of life. Sure, Nietzsche finds a valid point of origin in free will and agency, and in his argument as to what causes different kinds of pain when unneeded, he maintains that the cause is suffering. Nietzsche is fundamentally right in his observation of pain, but I maintain that Nietzsche is merely observing that pain is caused by a metaphysical issue: the individual's aloneness.
Everyone is unique, meaning that every individual suffers alone, and it's this unique aspect of the human experience that defines the pain we feel. The story of eternal death doesn't really suffer our pain, as it lives forever, that is, it's not actually unending; it's more of a foregone conclusion. However, ""You, however, can expect to die."" As it is, no one expects to be doing anything they've done.
The proposition is simple: each and every human being makes these decisions, makes these choices, lives and creates their own reality, and is unperceived by anyone. Even these quite basic practical matters are largely independent of outside perspectives. Why then, are we forced into this illusion of awareness and subjectivity?
Suffering, the experience of pain, can only occur if there are choices to be made, otherwise we couldn't feel a loss, or anything of the sort. This is where Nietzsche is mistaken, because he isn't willing to acknowledge the choice's existence - and neither can we. There is no choice, for there is no option to do otherwise. Nietzsche's version of metaphysics isn't honest enough to allow the falseness in his conclusions.
Nietzsche's dismissal of metaphysics because he can't resolve it within his worldview is an absurdity. A truth about the world need not be addressed, yet can be effectively used to achieve practical ends. Maybe, just maybe, there is some way to resolve a truth about the world using human agency? I maintain the latter is true,",534,4,2439

The computer was used in the 1940’s for the first weather prediction. Since then the use of the internet, satellite, and numerous other sources have helped to make any prediction of an approaching weather condition more accurate and precise than ever before.
The next most important piece of information to gather about weather is knowing the ground temperature. Weather prediction models are based on something called soil moisture as well.
These predictions are what weather watchers rely on the most and are then interpreted by others including flight controllers and car drivers. This prediction will give a representation of the conditions of the atmosphere, something that makes reading the weather on a map almost useless. Of course, you will also have to know what direction the storm is headed and at what speed.
Another piece of information that is important for those who are living along the east coast and in the Midwest is to be aware of a storm that is heading in their direction and just how fast it’s moving. Even though you have a storm prediction that predicts that a storm is approaching, that’s only half the story. There are many others that are waiting just as anxiously for updates as you are and it’s important to be the first one that has the information. At that point you can be the first one to provide the public with important information.
With the aid of the weather prognosticators and meteorologists who have put together a network to share the most current information, anyone can get information to their phones and their devices. When it comes to storms, hurricanes, and other types of severe weather there are many that are interested in getting up to the minute information on what’s going on as soon as possible.
By using the internet to connect with other mobile devices via the world wide web, you can also keep in touch with people who are close to you who may be in an area that is in danger of being affected by the storm.
When it comes to severe weather conditions such as hurricanes and blizzards, the information that you can obtain is even more important. It’s very likely that if you are in the path of a storm that is headed your way that the news reports are likely to be more accurate when it comes to getting updates on the current situation. But even if you know it’s not necessarily safe to take out your cell phone or walk outside you can still update your friends about what’s happening",517,4,2658

AIA Minnesota (Detroit)
It seems amazing that the world’s most famous architect and the state’s healthiest state, are now at odds. When the Association of Architects (AIA) moved their headquarters in 2006, from St. Louis, MO to the nation’s capital, the result was their catastrophic involvement in lead paint. They claimed they had not been involved in the removal of lead paint in the 1940s and 1950s.
The fact that they still had to remove lead paint to protect their employees is unacceptable. And, the story of Minnesota’s AIA is more disgusting. Lead paint was used in the construction of buildings in the 19th century. The state’s legislature has not allowed for any removal of paint that contains asbestos.
This certainly means that the state’s population should be safe from having to remove lead paint from buildings. However, there are people who still need to be exposed to lead paint. The decision to remove lead paint from buildings is already an abuse of power.
Where Is Lead Paint Allowed?
This is the question that will be answered in 2020. Many of the workers at the most common construction sites of the world are being exposed to asbestos. There are many safety concerns about asbestos, and this could ultimately lead to cancer in some cases.
However, it is the easiest task that you can do in your architecture, to consider what you are going to do about the future use of asbestos. The ability to change the environment to remove the asbestos risk",495,4,2565

The AI gatekeeper's role serves to guide and control the system's decision-making process. This gives it more power than a data analytics or decision support system. With a higher trust in the AI gatekeeper, the flow of data and information is properly evaluated by humans in positions of power. However, AI gatekeepers face several challenges in detecting and handling complex, emotional human interactions. Therefore, it is important to have more AI gatekeepers as they can work together with the potential AI threat to ensure that progress is not lost to unethical and discriminatory technologies.
Human behaviour patterns may also have a profound impact on technology. A commonly used system called 'leveraging' uses data in an attempt to uncover hidden relationships between data. It is an effective way to uncover the facts that we already know. But it can also be used to make fraudulent claims about potential hackers. Because it is accurate and clear, users can easily see the differences between the entities. In this way, using this system can lead to undesirable outcomes. But how does it work?
It is important to keep in mind that while automation has made our life easier, it is also contributing to greater inequality and financial risk. For example, automation may increase the growth of income inequality in the USA and further lower the wages of workers, leading to more layoffs. Furthermore, automation is gradually transforming society in ways that affect everyone – including financial gains and savings. This could lead to a future where technology replaces millions of jobs, making many people better off, while others struggle.
Artificial intelligence has been identified as the new threat in the finance industry. As AI is a force for innovation in the financial sector, AI is a problem as it will eventually replace existing systems and processes. While AI is extremely advanced, there is a need for caution when evaluating its potential. The rapidly changing nature of technology also makes it difficult to predict. It is only when the industry realizes the need to be cautious that it will recognize the potential of AI as a threat to their own business.
The unintended consequences of AI are a serious concern for the financial industry. As AI is being used for credit scoring and pricing, it is becoming a major threat to traditional financial services. The risks associated with it are high, and the potential for unintended consequences is likely. The new technologies and AI-driven financial products could lead to a massive loss of jobs and even increase inequality. This could be",528,4,2782

We are surrounded by images, from his and hers, to side by side, off center and wherever else one might imagine. As a result, photographers will either improve with practice or fade into the background as opportunities arise. Usually the former; seldom the latter. Sometimes a photographer captures the spirit, the essence or the action. This unfortunately, is not always the case. Stories within still imagery still depend on the viewer as much as the picture. The photographs featured in this section are typical. The quality may vary, but the message is the same. ""In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not. If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.""
The photographs captured by Linda Shalom were in response to the question: ""What happens when we die?"" Shalom, who lives and works as a photographer in Ontario, Canada, turned the focus on the community of eco-friendly graves found in Gravenhurst, Ontario, the legendary Muskoka. ""She was also inspired by Anni Albers statement, Art is to do with things, not with words: I interpreted this to mean that one can express things with words, but not things. So for this series I was searching for visual metaphors of life and death, things that could communicate her words.
Shalom explains, ""I came across the question and thought it would be interesting to find out what happened to those people who had decided not to be buried under the ground and were, instead, having green burials in Muskoka, Canada. I was even more fascinated by the fact that these people would be buried in a coffin made of a real tree trunk. They are then placed in the earth, surrounded by earth that has been gathered from where they are buried, on top of each other in a mound of boulders, under which is a layer of burlap lined with fabric from which the elders weave the shroud of the deceased. On top of the mound, are a few native plants which are found on this local land. The story is often told that these plants could tell you what that person was like. I chose to photograph these undertakers, these nature care-takers, the soil mounds, the caterers, the sayings on the tombstones, and those beautiful, gentle people who would hold me or shake my hand,",516,4,2407
336,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", in a nutshell.
Engineering is an analysis and design process. To begin an engineering design project, an engineer will usually start by understanding and then exploring potential ways to solve a given problem, often by referring to well-known problem-solving methodologies. Once a possible solution (design) has been devised, an engineer will then decide how to test the design, what sort of instrumentation and instrumentation set up to use, how to verify that the engineering design actually works, and how to measure the performance of the design.
At this point, the answer that best resolves the problem will then be selected as the correct solution. Or in the real world, many solutions will be tried and discarded before a final solution is chosen. These rejected solutions are called alternatives. A sketch or design may also be called a possible design or idea. Engineers work to find possible solutions to problems for many reasons such as to improve existing products or for future ones. An engineer may work to solve specific individual problems while another might seek to solve many more basic ones that may be related to technologies and advances in society. Engineers seek to understand the performance characteristics and characteristics of materials in order to improve existing solutions or create new ones. They work together in large and small teams on projects that require extensive communication and coordination.
When explaining the role of an engineer, one must realize that engineers come from a wide range of backgrounds and therefore have diverse skills. In the academic world, as an engineer, one would be in charge of designing, developing and marketing a product or service. In industry, however, the role of the engineer is more limited. Engineers can work for a variety of companies that provide services, such as software companies or engineering consultancies. Many engineers are also entrepreneurs who develop new technologies and products. In a larger sense, engineering does have an impact on many areas of society including military and emergency services.
In military applications, engineering plays an important role. Military engineers design weapons systems for the military, and work to build their own weapons. Much of the weaponry and armor used by the military are designed by engineers. Engineers also play a major role in the design of various vehicles used by military. The most common design concept for vehicles is the tank or the aircraft.
One of the areas of engineering where engineering classes and degree in engineering studies are important is in the study of materials. Material science, or materials science engineering, is concerned with the study of the properties and structure of substances. A major part of materials science is the study of various materials such as metals, ceramics and organic substances. Engineers must have",518,4,2894

I think that my expression of genes is influenced by environment, but not by nurture.
False.
Environmental factors do influence expression of genes, but this is not the same thing as nurture. People tend to conflate the two to a significant degree. Nurture is an effect of environmental influences on a person’s behavior and is frequently driven by experience in a social environment that other animals do not experience (or are not capable of experiencing, such as infants born prematurely who are unable to develop interoception.) In contrast, environment is any influence, directly or indirectly, on a person’s health and fitness, such as diet and disease.
I have two identical twin brothers. Although we have some minor differences in our appearance, our bodies have always been indistinguishable to people who know us, and we’ve had the same diet and physical exercise and good health for decades. This proves that nurture is unimportant.
False.
Even if identical twins have identical genes, and have had identical experiences for their entire lives, they will not have identical biomarkers of health and fitness. If a person over time develops the adverse health effects of bad diet and stress, then, once these genes start producing the adverse health effects, the only way to correct this is via a change in lifestyle, which will not be applied if genes are responsible for all disease.
I have been drinking alcohol for years, and my DNA sequence looks exactly the same as a teetotaller’s. This proves that genes have nothing to do with alcoholism.
False.
Even if your DNA sequence has been completely conserved for centuries, there is no doubt that your genome can change over time. There are several proof of principle cases of such, where humans with homozygous backgrounds (all of their chromosome are identical, like an identical twins) have had certain phenotypic traits develop due to stress and disease. Think of HIV/AIDS; if you have an identical twin, and one gets it, and the other doesn’t, then you can say that environment influenced the outcome.
I don’t have any emotional baggage or anything that would make me depressed. If I act out, it’s not because I don’t have healthy genetic responses to something I could have easily avoided; it’s just that I felt a kind of ‘karmic justice’ for what I did, and nature just had to catch up. I don’t feel depressed, I’m not ‘broken’; in fact I’m relieved that I feel this way!

If the 25 feet Mini RJ45 is not available, LACADA recommends to convert the signals with a repeater box, some IT devices which implement a standard interface between the two ports. The alternative solution is to use TP/TAP cables.

To truly grasp the concept of CINEMA and foster a better understanding of its history, it is important to take note of the latest developments that made the success story more achievable for aspiring readers.
Preserving its role as a medium has assured growth and success with the technologies that surround the celluloid. From the simple time of the invention of the camera, film on film, to digital video formats, CINEMA, as we know it, has undergone a great change over time. The emergence of Internet, online streaming services, and online cinematography contributed immensely to its success. It is a medium that heavily relies on technology and methodologies that are in direct correlation with the newest developments in the ever-changing world of cinematography.
At the heart of the obsession with development and change is the appreciation for CINEMA. The loudspeakers, TV, Smart TV, handheld, and many other devices are a blessing to the industry. There is no doubt that, amid technological advancements, the CINEMA mania has become stronger. Every phase of CINEMA history suggests that, the industry, as we know it, has thrived well over the years in the presence of innovation. With every new innovation, there comes a new opportunity.
Many firsts, different forms of cinema, and technological changes have led to this current renaissance for CINEMA. As we observe many changes, several challenges have emerged as well.

340,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is hard. The main challenge is that the first principles are general and the behaviour of the world we live in is specific. For example, one of the first principles is that the sum of two real numbers is always real; another is that if you have two positive real numbers then the square root of their product is between them. Real numbers are points on a straight line. Square roots are functions from a subset of the real numbers to the same set; the subset is the positive real numbers. So the first principle does not make any statements about what it means to add a point of the line with a function. Why is the square root of positive real numbers between its two input numbers? Because mathematical laws work well in general for the real world but our world is not contained within the real line. Also, the question of ""are numbers a sufficient construct for geometry?"" is a contentious one. When does a geometric shape start to lose meaning as a construct, i.e. when can we stop identifying some simple object, e.g. a circle, with a mathematical function? Not sure if this will end up being true or not, but mathematics are indeed finding other uses beyond geometry at a surprisingly fast rate.

For what they are worth I am going to share some basics of my understanding.

Mathematics is just not a collection of tables, lists and little patterns. Math is also not about proof. Proof is not the content of math but only a tool.

Math is about pattern recognition and seeing the inherent structure of a pattern. That is very different from solving a problem, but also important. Math is about discovering the multiple relationships that a phenomenon can exhibit under a small set of general principles.

Actually one of the crucial lessons from mathematics (not taught well) is that we should always question everything. Most problems in math are just bad attempts to answer a question - they get a different problem right.

Note that the principles that you mentioned are the problem with the second approach, which is a much harder thing to understand. Math is also not about solving. It is often much easier to mathematise a phenomenon than to mathematise a problem. To quote Niels Bohr, ""If Physics is mathematics, then it is high time for mathematics to become physics"".

Mathematics is also incredibly discrete. Many of the most general mathematical constructs do not work well when taken together, which is why combinatorics works perfectly if you solve your combinatorial problem with only one or two numbers, but when you have to deal with many of them (and comb",517,4,2579

Neuroscience is a diverse field that has undergone significant development and advancements over the years. Here's a brief history of neuroscience in 10 bullet points:

1. Ancient civilizations have long been fascinated with the human brain and have recorded their observations in various texts and cave drawings.

2. In the 17th century, Francis Bacon (English philosopher) argued that there is a connection between mind and matter.

3. In 1890, Santiago Ramón y Cajal (Spanish neuroscientist) became the first person to describe the brain cells (neurons) in detail through his electron microscope.

4. In the early 20th century, Wilhelm Wundt (German psychologist) established the first laboratory dedicated to studying psychology, including the study of the brain and behavior.

5. Around the same time, Ivan Pavlov (Russian physiologist) conducted experiments on dogs that would later inspire a concept known as classical conditioning.

6. In 1929, Jerome LeDouble (American neurologist) identified acetylcholine, the first neurotransmitter.

7. In the 1950s, neuroscientists started to use techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans to study brain activity in living humans.

8. The first drug targeting a specific neurotransmitter (reserpine) was synthesized in 1952.

9. During the 1970s, Francis Crick and James Watson (British physicists) published their seminal paper on the molecular structure of DNA, which was then used to inform our understanding of how the brain works.

10. Today, neuroscience continues to grow and evolve, with new techniques like optogenetics (using light to control specific neurons) being developed to better understand the neural basis of behavior.",366,4,1759

With data generation as the world’s most valued commodities, and machine learning tools built upon Artificial Intelligence, it can be assumed that 2018 will be the year of artificial intelligence and algorithms. These algorithms have created their own weapons (apps, software, and gadgets), robots, and even systems for solving various problems. Even though many are affected by data leakage and data safety due to the algorithms, experts believe that the new year will continue to witness an evolutionary approach in the technology market. Therefore, in 2018, software application development will be an important factor in taking advantage of technologies.
What is a hybrid app? Hybrid Applications are the combination of mobile web application and native application. Hybrid apps are usually built on web technologies like HTML5, CSS, or JavaScript. They can take advantage of the native capabilities and functionalities of a mobile platform. These apps have been created in such a way that they can run on multiple platforms with a single codebase. One of the biggest advantages of a hybrid app is the ability to run on any mobile or web browsers. The best part is that you don’t need a server to store your app data.
In 2018, hybrid mobile applications are going to be the most sought after. With hybrid apps, you can build an application that you can deploy in iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux.
Benefits of hybrid applications:
1. Your code can be ported to multiple platforms. The code is reusable and you can reuse the code that you have written in one platform on other platforms.
2. Hybrid applications can be deployed on multiple platforms.
3. Hybrid applications do not require a back end server to store the app data.
4. Hybrid applications are capable of saving the data to the native devices.
5. Hybrid applications are cost-effective and require less development time.
6. Hybrid applications are more secure than native applications. They are protected by a number of security measures such as encryption, authentication, and permission checks.
7. Hybrid applications have the ability to work without any network connectivity. This is why they are used for offline applications.
The advantage of using hybrid applications is that you can save development time and money. You can build an application in a few days instead of waiting for weeks. You can also launch an application for multiple platforms with a single codebase.

This was done by plotting a chart of stars on paper that portrayed the data in a flat plane. Over the years the drawings got more and more complex with the addition of data and features. In the latter part of the 1800's celestial photographs were created using glass plates to capture images. In the early part of the 20th century photography of the stars was made with film and kept in photographic plates. These, of course, can be viewed for either analytical or aesthetic purposes. Of more relevance to my interests in astronomy are those early astrographic data reduction systems, notably the Morgan Roberts system that used computer-generated light sensitive plates to make images of stars. As technology progressed and more sophisticated cameras were available for the reduction of astrographic data it became possible to create the 3d spheres in the manner in which I do.

Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a man named Jack. Jack was a great chef who had always been fascinated by the idea of cooking with AI. He had read about how AI could help in the kitchen by suggesting recipes, calculating ingredients, and even cooking dishes on its own.

Jack was determined to try out AI in his kitchen. He searched for the best AI cooking app in town, which he found on a tech blog. He purchased the app and installed it on his computer, and he was amazed at how quickly it recognized the ingredients in his pantry and suggested a recipe.

Excited about his new tool, Jack decided to cook with AI for the first time. He opened the app, which suggested a recipe for a delicious and healthy lasagna. Jack followed the instructions and started cooking. But to his surprise, he found that the AI was following the instructions step by step, but it was not adding any of his personal touches to the dish. Jack tried again, but the dish came out bland and uninteresting.

Feeling disappointed, Jack decided to give up on the idea of using AI in the kitchen. But one day, he met a young girl named Sophia who was a tech enthusiast. Sophia was a food blogger who had just started her own AI cooking app. She had designed her app to be much more interactive than the previous one, and she also encouraged users to customize their dishes according to their preferences.

Jack was intrigued by Sophia's app and decided to give it a try. He created an account and started experimenting with the app. He found that he could not only suggest recipes but also customize them by adding or removing ingredients. He could even choose the cooking style and temperature, and the app would adjust the recipe accordingly.

Sophia had also programmed her app to learn from the user's actions. She had designed it to remember the user's cooking preferences and suggest similar recipes. Jack found this feature to be very useful, and he was now able to cook with AI without feeling like he was following a recipe blindly.

With the help of Sophia's AI cooking app, Jack was able to cook a dish that was both delicious and personalized. He had discovered that AI could indeed be a useful tool in the kitchen, but it required a good app and a user who knew how to use it.

Biology describes and explains the structure and function of organisms, and how they interact with each other and with their environment. There are a myriad of connections from this field to us. Every time we wake up in the morning, we can be certain that millions of little things are taking place in our bodies which support and run our body. There is no aspect of our lives which is not impacted by biology.
Take the simple everyday body tasks of eating, sleeping, getting dressed, working, playing, talking, and excretion. A person cannot take even one of these tasks for granted. Each of these require thousands upon thousands of different chemical reactions in the cells of our bodies to happen regularly for us to do each of these everyday things. Even the simplest actions requires specialized biological activities to function and take place.
As you may remember from high school biology, the cells are the cells are the basic building blocks of all living things. There are trillions of cells in our bodies, and each cell performs a very specific function. The biological processes involving the trillions of cells working together, are the very basic functioning for our life. Our cells replicate, repair, fight off infection, respond to our environment, transport oxygen, create energy, fight cancer, recycle waste products, maintain structure, and the list goes on and on. Each cell is very specialized and connected to other cells. Without the cells performing their specific tasks, we would not be able to live.
The body has cells and organs, which are interconnected to carry out the multiple biological activities. Take a single cell, for example. The cell generates a response to a physical stimulus, via a protein. All of these proteins receive a signal from outside the cell through specific receptors. The protein which was acting like a sensor, is activated by the receptor on the outside of the cell, and within the cell, works by completing a chain of biological events until a specific enzyme or chemical which works in a biological pathway called for a specific effect. These responses to environmental stimuli are as unique to each individual as their genetic code. Therefore, each person has to process various environmental stimuli in unique ways, with biological activity which is distinctive and specific to each of us. These biological pathways may also respond to events in a negative or harmful way, which can lead to a disease or illness.

Space exploration is the study, analysis, development and exploration of outer space (exoplanetary and cosmic space), either indirectly or through direct interaction with extraterrestrial organisms. It also refers to the use of orbiting satellites for military purposes such as surveillance, communications, intelligence gathering, navigation, early warning and weapons platforms.
It involves various international treaties and agreements between nations, to restrict arms race in space. These treaties and agreements attempt to control the military space activities. Space has already become very significant in national strategic assessments and it has become too much important to the nations for its control and its increasing scope. Thus, international space cooperation has to develop so that most of the spaces can be free of weapons and can be used for peaceful purposes.
Sustainable space programs are projects which make a new contribution to knowledge, tools or applications of value to society, while respecting and protecting the interests of others. Sustainable space programs have to do with the interaction of space with many important societal concerns of life on earth.
Various models are available to describe the economics and governance of space systems. The most commonly used are the three-fold economic classification and the five-fold governance classification. Every model is necessary to support real-space decision-making process.
Any progress in the space exploration mainly based on the utilitarian (prospective – benefits based) objectives and practical reasons. Pragmatism determines that all the space programmes have to be useful and beneficial to the mankind and greater cosmopolitan good. There can be an exclusion in the utilitarian approach like the space debris. The space exploration with pragmatic objective focuses on whether this particular mission can be useful in generating revenues for the program rather than developing the new potential benefits and areas of expansion for the space science.
Descriptive studies of space exploration have been very important in establishing the history, sociology, culture, civilization, politics, economy, and military history of human space exploration.
The oceans around Earth are expanding. The largest sea in the world is located in the area of the North Pole. The biggest changes in the Earth's surface are likely to happen under the Antarctic ice.

Wildlife rehabilitation in the United States has a long and varied history, dating back to the 1800s when some individuals began to care for injured and orphaned animals. The modern era of wildlife rehabilitation, however, really began in the 1930s and 1940s when organizations like the Humane Society of the United States and the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of New England emerged.

During the mid-1900s, state and federal laws were enacted to provide more legal protections for wildlife and establish guidelines for wildlife rehabilitation. In 1975, the federal government passed the Endangered Species Act, which provided funding and support for wildlife rehabilitation programs and helped to establish national standards for the industry.

Today, there are over 1,400 wildlife rehabilitation centers and organizations in the United States, all of which work to rescue, rehabilitate, and release sick, injured, or orphaned wildlife. Many of these organizations are run by volunteers or nonprofit organizations, with a focus on rehabilitation and education. Wildlife rehabilitators are trained to care for a variety of species, from songbirds and small mammals to large carnivores like bears and wolves.

Overall, wildlife rehabilitation in the United States has come a long way since its early days, and the industry has grown and evolved to become a key part of our efforts to protect and conserve the natural world.

It's great to know that wildlife rehabilitation has come so far in the US. Are there any particular challenges that wildlife rehabilitators face?
Yes, there are several challenges that wildlife rehabilitators face. One of the biggest challenges is finding a balance between providing effective care to wildlife and respecting their natural behavior and habits. This can be especially difficult with certain species, such as larger carnivores or endangered species, that require a high level of monitoring and care.

Another challenge that wildlife rehabilitators face is funding. Rehab centers often rely on donations and grants to operate, and the costs associated with caring for wildlife can be high, particularly for large or specialized animals.

Additionally, wildlife rehabilitators must navigate regulations and laws governing the capture, care, and release of wildlife. Understanding and complying with these regulations can be a difficult and time-consuming task.

Finally, wildlife rehabilitators must also deal with the stress and trauma that can be experienced by animals in their care. Providing emotional support and care to injured or orphaned animals can be emotionally challenging, and rehabilitation centers must work to create a safe and nurturing environment for all the animals in their care.

Traditionalists insist on ""theater in the round"", though this term belies the different uses of the space, and the different concepts of performance which its round configuration fosters. Similarly, the distinction between theater-in-the-round and the amphitheater has led to a distinction between ""in the round"" and ""circumferential"" layout, or even the characterization of the amphitheater as a ""triangle"" (square?) in relation to the ""in the round"" setting. I see the theater as a tool, not a concept, nor a technique. Whether a theater is frontispiece, cyclorama, archway, or cabinet of curiosities, its precise layout and the conventions it supports are the result of choices about what ideas and emotions we want to evoke. Its shape is, quite literally, its particular form, and a tool is a tool - a sidecut plane, or a block plane. What's important about any plane is that it is a tool - a product of craft. It's not the tool itself that matters, but what the tool does; only thereafter, when a metaphor is ready, do we say that the tool does things. And all of this is, to a large degree, beside the point. What I am most interested in here, in fact, is the correlation between the platonic ""construction"" and the artifacts which spring from it, and how they can shape us, the subject of this paper. I am also concerned with whether and how theater affects our language - our thoughts - and how those thoughts color our aesthetics.
This is more or less an art related post, as I lay bare the fusion of thoughts, poetry and mechanics, or the process of how a show is constructed - perhaps most importantly, what it means to us. I write mostly from the perspective of a director - I cannot claim expertise on any other aspects of production. I have something else going on here, I hope, beyond the methods of construction. My interest is in what happens inside us, at the level of anatomy, not in how the dust is removed from the machinery. I write this out of the belief that theater can change us; in fact, it feels like nothing else. The process matters; what happens beyond the space is critical. Like the people I work with, and sometimes those I don't, the execution of each show is always a transformation, and it's one that can be turned to (in friendship and in utility) far into the future",523,4,2360

So, many brilliant minds don’t delve into this field in full yet can establish fundamental principles to gain remarkable achievements that have made their names well-known. Let’s start with the great Russian scientist Petr Kapitsa, who has solved one of the pressing problems related to hydrogen. While exploring a dense molecular structure, he developed special technical calculations to describe the behavior of electric conductors and gaseous substances under high pressure. The result of this work laid the foundation of his success: physics.

These lines are only a part of his brilliant past, while many other groundbreaking achievements have not been reported by the mainstream media so far. Our team stumbled upon these nuances and set an aim to reshape this knowledge in our new series, Quantum Metamorphosis. Our first book about Kapitsa’s life will be published at the turn of 2018.

Petr Kapitsa is currently a little-known person, but he was named “The Miracle Man of Physics” in 1967. His impact on the development of the science is comparable to the achievements of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Let’s figure out what the science field experts are saying about one of the most intriguing minds of our time.

• “A Russian theoretician, grandfather of the molecular beam discharge method, a pioneer in the development of freeze-drying, the author of the first inventions for the production of uranium fission products, and the creator of the experimental method of measuring the speed of light in gaseous media. Pioneer in the field of studying the local components of many-particle systems; Practitioner of the contemporary concept of entropy; Pathfinder in the development of the so-called interfield theory”.
– The Encyclopaedia Britannica
• “Kapitsa was like a walk-in version of the fifth dimension. Where else could one find such a big white-bearded wizard as this, with an unbelievably large number of new inventions on many different topics at the same time? His name became synonymous with fundamental discoveries in a wide variety of fields, all of them painstakingly researched one after the other to the very point of exhaustion”.
– Bohuslav Polian

The use of poetry in health care has many applications from enriching patient care to practicing medicine. When literature is used to teach evidence-based information to clinicians, nursing care and treatment strategies are made more effective. This can allow for healthier patient outcomes.
In school, we might focus on the specific kinds of poems we've studied and the skills necessary to compose them. If we study poetry for creative writing, it can help students to gain confidence in their abilities as poets, writers, and communicators. They can enjoy self-expression, express their individual voices, and perform their words to the delight of those who listen. Literature students can also participate in writing competitions or publish their works in literary magazines.
Reading poetry can also be a good way to stretch your mind as you study literature. As students, we are often bombarded with loads of information, some of which can be the same. With poetry, however, new ideas are introduced through verbal imagery and unusual vocabulary. As you read poetry, it's easy to remember each work's meaning because of its unique flow, rhythm, and rhyme.
Choosing the poem that will be used is important. If a poem's message is significant, the students should know what it is about. The length of time needed to read a poem is also important. If the poem is a long one, it might take less time than a shorter one. When it comes to how to read a poem, most students like to use the method of repeating each line of the poem.
Many schools require students to write an essay for a course. This is a way to show their knowledge of literature and how they interpret the author's thoughts. Sometimes these essays are written in groups. In other cases, students will write an essay by themselves.
The themes of poems vary from one to another. However, there are some common themes used in poems such as religion, politics, relationships, death, etc. Religion is one of the most common themes in literature. This is because it makes the students understand how people feel about life and how they view it. It is also a great way to express one's feelings about the world, and it is great to read poems about faith, prayer, and hope.

In ancient Egypt, one of the first uses for cryptography was finding ways to keep written messages secret. The more advanced the methods, the less chance a scribe would be able to break the secret cipher. These messages may have been fun and friendly, or they may have been used to plan dangerous military missions. We can guess what kinds of messages were being passed, but we do not know when and where the messages were sent. One group of pioneers who excelled in this field were the scribes at Memphis' Rosetta Stone. Having deciphered the stone, we are able to read this lost art.

### Home of the Nomen Rosetta

The Nomen Rosetta is a South American construct, an ornamental sign with some sort of musical function. The great Frank Zappa assembled a band of professional musicians to play some of this music; luckily we have some sound recordings of the music. Last week I had the pleasure of having dinner with a friend who agreed to transcribe a little of this music. While transcribing we came across some interesting sections where Zappa seems to do something with the time signature that has no notational reference, and where he changes the rhythm in the middle of a phrase. These situations are both reminiscent of something in Egyptian temple music, while these works have nothing to do with Egypt.

Lizard King

So why am I talking about Egyptian cryptography in a blog on trying to put mathematical ideals into practice? Well, although that could be a very long story, I think the short story is this. Every religion (and any dominant religion can be described as a culture, or perhaps a culture can be described as a religion) makes use of secret messages for various purposes. For example, Christians were expected to keep their Bible secret. During the Second World War it was forbidden by the Allies to have an English Bible in your possession, you had to have a French version. Certain symbolic fonts were explicitly banned. This is a well known tactic that was also used by the Nazis. It comes down to the same basic thing: keep the secret message a secret. Of course there are good reasons for keeping messages secret. But there are also reasons to not keep messages secret. The basic idea of the scribes at Memphis, they would write a message but not commit it to memory. They would do this to avoid making enemies among the corrupt authority (such as all forms of power that lack the kind of long-term perspective that makes them want to keep the world, such as empires). But, they were already away",515,4,2526

At least I do, the thought that I don't have to do it perfectly, the perfectionist in me cringing, it no longer exists but I want to preserve that integrity of my writing.
I don't think you have to worry too much about how you present your poetry. Write honestly, write something you like to read and if you want to read about your love, then go right ahead.
But make sure that they make sense. Even in a strict rhyme or measure, there should be some kind of order for you to follow and the poem itself should have an ounce of seriousness. You don't have to go preachy, all you have to do is sort of convey the message you wanted to. Make it relatable. That's what the guys at Essaybox.org say, they're not big on poetry.

Artificial intelligence has been around for many years, but what is new is the way that organizations are using AI technology to become more effective. For example, AI is now used in language translation and medical research to sift through large volumes of data. However, not everyone is so sure that AI is worth the investment. Some say that it will replace jobs and others say that it won't. According to the venture capitalist firm General Catalyst Partners, the economic impact of AI on the economy is estimated at $8 trillion by 2030.
The company also suggests that “AI will also lead to a shift in the skills needed in the job market, with the most important skills changing from technical skills to soft skills.” Additionally, General Catalyst has the following advice for companies who want to make use of AI:
- Make AI a part of your company’s value chain
- Data is an important input to AI. Collect as much data as possible
- Do the basics first
- AI can be used to create new products and services, do not just replace existing products and services.",225,4,1101

How to compost properly is best to consider when you choose the correct materials for gardening. Of course, there are numerous chemicals that you can use, but this may not be the best of choices, as it is toxic. Now if you use items in an environmentally friendly way they may be very beneficial to your plants. Gardening with concern to the environment is imperative, as you will create a much better existence for yourself and the environment.
Gardening is a significant form of relief and it gives you a bit of isolation with nature. With close attention to detail you will be able to develop the beauty of an environment that is interesting and calm. There are many ways in which gardening can be practiced that will be effective and pleasant. Your outlook on life will change once you add to the relaxing quality of gardening in the right manner. Should you be making your gardening eco-friendly, it can help you feel and live a more serene life as well.
After a long work day, having some time to relax in your own garden can be a tremendous way to unwind and come back to yourself. Your garden can be a retreat for you where you can just sit back and enjoy the sweet sound of nature. There is no other way for people to come to the realization of how much happier they will be when they tend their own garden and feel in control of the environment that surrounds them. Because this gives you a sense of independence, you will become more confident with yourself and able to deal with situations in life.
Every garden is not going to be the same when you think about creating an oasis for you and your family to enjoy, it will be unique, and therefore it should be valued. You need to remember that each garden has its own purpose and is going to be unique when it is designed and created. But you want to think about what you can do to make it more beautiful and valuable than it already is. If you are looking to sell your home, this might even add to the value of it.
Selling a home is not an easy task. Many things can go wrong as there are always unforeseen challenges. One mistake that you may make that will deter a potential buyer is neglecting to add more value to your home. Just remember that you should take care of your garden in order to make it look more appealing. Your garden will usually sell your home to a lot of potential buyers who are interested. This is going to add to the appeal of",513,4,2517

16 Nov 2017 10:24am
KEETMANSHOOP: Neshma Holscher is a passionate young Namibian who strives to teach the same passion for nature and its preservation to fellow Namibians in rural areas.
She is the founder of iWild, a teaching enterprise aimed at promoting environmental awareness and education. The enterprise hosts a variety of nature-related workshops in areas deemed to be underprivileged, and is supported by the Rotary Club of Swakopmund. ""I love nature and I believe that if Namibians are taught about how important it is to protect it, they will have a greater appreciation for it,"" she says.
She believes that in order to achieve conservation awareness, it is important to start educating Namibians from a young age.
""Owning a university degree does not necessarily mean that one is a conservationist. What is more important is to have the heart for nature conservation; the drive to make a difference. That is something you cannot teach, but one can be encouraged towards,"" Holscher says.
With limited funding, Holscher has managed to convince six students from different universities to mentor 20 students who they believe have a passion for nature conservation, by taking part in the iWild workshops.
Through these workshops, young Namibians in certain rural parts of the country are being educated, as they are taught about the importance of nature conservation and waste management. In addition, they are encouraged to grow their own food, and to be sustainable in their consumption.
""The idea behind this is to teach them that they need to be self-sufficient, to live a life that allows them to be sustainable in the long run,"" Holscher says.
According to her, through these workshops the students are guided towards understanding the importance of nature conservation.
""During our nature workshops, we teach them how to do recycling. I believe that we should treat nature as a big asset that we are obliged to keep, and that is also the message we are trying to put across. The workshops also include organic gardening; this is a new area we are focusing on, and we recently held a garden-building workshop in Windhoek. We recently engaged in youth conservation clubs, and we are looking for ways to encourage more Namibians to participate in our workshops,"" she says.
The cost for holding a workshop is mostly funded by the Rotary Club, and in the past Holscher has volunteered to pay for some of the expenses. However,",503,4,2460

The typical curricular emphasis on training children to perform music without a specific educational background focuses on theory instruction, instrumental teaching, harmony, rhythm, and notation, and many schools use textbooks that provide children with instructions for familiar sheet music or music in the traditional style. However, there are many additional styles that are familiar to people across the globe. Discovering these styles has led music educators to appreciate cultural diversity and connect music education to a variety of other fields such as ethnomusicology. The result has been the creation of courses for higher education that are based on cultural diversity. While the role of general music in primary and secondary education has become more important, it is unclear how this may influence musical performance abilities. Therefore, this study investigated how current knowledge of learning in childhood can inform understanding of music education as well as changes in the teaching of general music.
In the research, general music became the central focus, with emphasis given to group experiences and the combination of various styles. Therefore, the study focused on the division of musical styles into three categories: folk music, music in fashion, and traditional music. Each of these categories is focused on different styles, and they vary in the difficulty of learning and the way they contribute to the study of music. In studying the three categories of musical styles, the focus shifted from the style to the connection of music to the production of music and the examination of music in general.",314,4,1804

Thus, the journals and audiences that they traditionally chose for the publication and dissemination of scholarship, have become unstable.
As I write this, I am simultaneously immersed in the largest international philosophy conference ever held in Mexico. There are scholars from all over the world giving conference papers and presenting posters. Some will produce the international, peer-reviewed articles and books that guarantee the reputation of the participants, while others will take home vague ideas and hazy notions that promise new perspectives on how their disciplines will develop in their communities. After the most recent discoveries of extraterrestrial life, however, the idea of philosophical knowledge seems more tenuous, albeit still plausible. Science has opened up a space of epistemological inquiry that is more abstract and borderless.
As a fifth-year PhD student in a philosophy department at a Canadian university, I find myself forced to navigate this new terrain. I’m obsessed with global philosophical developments, and am even starting to think of concepts, periods and ideas that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. I understand that my department’s international status means that it has played a primary role in shaping it (since the department was founded in the 1980s, it has hosted the most international conference of the discipline in Mexico). I also see that this status benefits me as an individual researcher, and may be a valuable part of my professional training in the near future.
That being said, I’m also faced with the dilemma of how my department should act, given the fact that it has taken on this new role. Is the type of global knowledge that it produces representative of philosophy more broadly? Does this have meaning for professional practices, and is this new paradigm sustainable for the field?
The problems facing the discipline (linked to the aforementioned publication and dissemination dynamics) require philosophy departments and organizations to acknowledge the emergence of a new norm, in which scholars accept a degree of participation in global knowledge production. Thus, the journals and audiences that they traditionally chose for the publication and dissemination of scholarship, have become unstable, as new initiatives are established every year, trying to break new ground. The possibility that questions, statements and publications no longer need to be confined to traditional publishers, that they can become part of the affordances of the (virtual) communities they belong to, are already becoming a reality. Today, in a relatively short span of time, more cultural criticism, public engagement and research topics are being brought",517,4,2901

Suppose, you have to create a PRG and you want it to be completely random-looking. How would you go about doing that?

To make it easier, assume that your PRG takes a blocksize $N$ and seed $s$ as input and output is $N$-bit string $x$.

#4
The idea is to take two independent uniform keys of length $N$, say $s, s'$ and then flip a coin randomly. If it says Head, it adds to $x$ and if it says Tail, it subtracts from $x$. It would look random to an attacker since he would think that $x$ is simply uniform.

The problem is this attack by person A:

Suppose, A has a $n$-bit binary string $b$, which means that his bits are $0$ or $1$ in equal proportion. Now, A knows $s$ and $s'$ and wishes to flip $b$ to contain $1$ on every bit. How would he do that?

#5
The simplest possible approach by A would be to find $n$ locations in $s, s'$ for which $\operatorname{P}(s = 0 \, \text{or} \, s' = 0) = 1/2$. A can simply modify the bits at those locations by tossing a coin which has heads probability of $1/2$. This will now yield $b = 1^n$. To get $b = 1^n$ for every bit, he can repeat this attack $n$ times.

Clearly, this is not sufficient. Maybe the server could have used a different PRG that creates a biased distribution rather than flipping bits?

#6
Yeah, that would be tough. Maybe this post from Scott here may be helpful:

The objective is to create a PRG which is strongly collision resistant. That means it is difficult to find a $m_1, m_2 \ne m_1$ such that $g(m_1) = g(m_2)$ where $g$ is the PRG. How would you go about doing that?

370,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," students' journey to creating an experimental new play.
There once were a group of theater students at a small university who were determined to create something truly groundbreaking. They had all studied the classics and were comfortable with the traditional plays, but they yearned to experiment with something new.

They had all read about experimental theater and had been impressed by the works of artists like Marina Abramović and Jeremy Deller. But they knew they could do better than simply imitating their work.

So, they hatched a plan to create their own experimental play. It would be a fusion of different art forms, from dance and music to video projections and multimedia installations. They would challenge their audience with a sensory experience that combined all of these elements in a way that no one had ever seen before.

The group of students began meeting regularly, brainstorming ideas and working on drafts of their play. They would spend hours in their tiny dorm room, locked away from the rest of the world, experimenting with different themes and concepts.

At first, their professors were skeptical. They had never heard of anything like this before and were unsure if the students would be able to pull it off. But as they worked and honed their craft, the students started to gain confidence.

They began to seek out experimental artists in their area to collaborate with and studied various art forms more extensively to better understand their abilities and how they could blend them together.

Months passed, and the students worked tirelessly, pouring their hearts and souls into the project. Eventually, the day arrived when they were ready to premiere their play to the public.

The theater was packed, and the audience was a mix of students and locals who had been lured in by curiosity. As the lights dimmed, the students took their places on the stage, ready to unleash their creation onto the world.

The music began to play, and the projections started, all while the actors began their performance. The audience was immediately immersed in the sensory experience that the students had created, and soon they were swept away by the wave of emotions that the play evoked.

The play was a resounding success, and the students were hailed as pioneers of experimental theater. They had pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the theater world, and it seemed that the sky was the limit for them.

The group of theater students continued to create works of art in the experimental genre, and their creativity and passion continued to inspire others to think outside the box and create something truly unique.

Oceanography is the study of oceans and the effects of water on everything from humans to weather to climate. It plays a crucial role in modern society as well as in many aspects of daily life.
Marine biologists study the many species of living organisms and their role in the environment, as well as any pollution or ocean conservation issues that may arise from their actions. They also study the many uses that humans can get out of the ocean.
Their findings aid in finding new medicines, food sources, new minerals, new materials for use in production, and new applications for materials and other resources. Oceans also regulate the climate, which is very important in terms of preserving the environment. Scientists also work on various other projects involving the ocean such as underwater mapping, exploration, and construction projects.
One new project that is gaining a lot of attention is the fabrication of new pipes for underground transportation of natural gas, oil, and water. These pipes are being manufactured using 3D printing technology. Researchers are able to use oceanography and seabed mapping to figure out the best places for pipes to be built, as well as the best methods for getting them to where they need to be.
The study of oceanography is an important part of many industries, but it is also important in areas of everyday life as well. These include marine weather forecasts, air quality control, disaster relief efforts, and emergency response planning.

374,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is one of the oldest in the history. It is associated with the deepest and most sacred human instincts (Anucelis 2008). Modern theater, as it is being described, is based on historical, philosophical, cultural, societal, and artistic heritage. Different genres of theater, whether classical, dramatic, tragic, symphonic, or opera, have evolved, but still contain many of the same elements that go back to the earliest incarnations of this particular medium of art. Modern theater includes the distinction between the “theater in general” (as an organic phenomenon) and the “modern theater” (as a phenomenal performance). The latter has evolved into a distinct discipline, as a response to the very nature and requirements of the former, and although both have their similarities, they are distinct in many ways (Firat 2008).
The major difference between these two (general and phenomenal) forms of theater is the tremendous degree of changes in the latter’s functions that has occurred due to various alterations in the way of social development, cultural changes, and the evolution of science and technology. Simply, theater has evolved greatly in the last few centuries, and modern theater still brings changes for a better contemporary and futuristic results. The primary function of the theater in general is to teach, enlighten and to entertain the people who come to the theater as an audience (Anucelis 2008).
Interestingly, the modern theater, as a philosophical notion, is based on individual, mental and cognitive differences and the connection with history, society, and humanity. Due to this, modern theater usually depends on contemporary methods and means (Rubin 1998).
Contemporary theater is one of the most important phenomena that was born after the World War II in Europe, especially in the Great Britain. The concept of modern theater was born in the mid-20th century as an answer for the traditional theater (Jirna and Blair 2007). The main principles of the contemporary theater include anti-faith, uncertainty of truth, and uncertainty of the individual (Jirna and Blair 2007). Important cultural, social and political changes and alterations that were imposed on the population led to the simplification of the theatrical formula in the modern theater. The audience in the theater and the sets and the acting, which should reflect the given society, are changed and this is a “suspension” from the everyday life.
As a philosophical and cultural phenomenon, the modern theater",486,4,2500
375,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is defined by what is included in the scope of its subject. It should be a study of what was once a culture and how it died or changed radically, and this knowledge should be accurate and as objective as possible, in order to provide a broader perspective to what we know about our human past. It should include all things related to the production of human cultural forms, by humans, and not simply the produced things themselves. We should focus our efforts on what happened in the past in order to better understand what is happening in the present, and what might happen in the future.
Substantially broadening the cultural scope of archaeology has been a one of the major focal points of developments in the discipline for the past hundred years, especially after the scientific analysis of archaeological material in the mid-19th century, and the discovery of radioactivity in the 1920s and 1930s, among other technological advances. Here we shall discuss the role of several major archaeological technologies in cultural horizons and interpretative frameworks in recent years. These tools are material, statistical, and data-archaeological, which should be further developed and analyzed for their effectiveness. These developments in methodologies are crucial, since they must form the basis for an accurate and increasingly powerful discipline.
The historical record as a raw data set is indisputably rich. It is the product of what archaeologists find and excavate, and a study of artifacts and other evidence of a culture must be “close” to that culture, otherwise it is ultimately flawed. Numerous technologies that were not available to, or were not perceived by, early archaeologists in the 19th and early 20th centuries can greatly help us understand the culture being investigated, and will allow us to do so in greater detail than would be possible otherwise. The discovery of Mesopotamia by archeologists in the mid-19th century brought the first systematic collection of pottery from a major civilization to the western world. Up until the Middle Ages, the western world was largely unaware of the pottery traditions of the Near and Middle East and Asia Minor. One of the first great revolutions in the study of pottery in Western archaeology was the recognition that pottery, or more accurately, ceramic material, was of paramount importance to the study of the past. Ceramic material was thought to provide evidence not only for the material culture of the past, but also its manufacturing technology, since it was usually the products of specific workshops and factories. With the increased collection and study of ceramic",485,4,2645

Nearly anyone who hears about the rapid rise of the robotics industry assumes that it somehow represents the death of human labor and productivity. Human beings, it seems, are on the outs. It just isn’t true.
Robotics is much more similar to the invention of the assembly line, which has had an on-again, off-again relationship with human labor. As complex assemblies, for example, move down the line, operators can come up with the best way to achieve the best results. Today, “merely intelligent robots” assist workers, but may never replace human labor, says Michael Orey, CEO of OriGen Robotics.
A more common misconception about robotics centers on the very name “robotics”. Robotics as a field or discipline started a couple of hundred years ago with the invention of the mechanical egg that cracked open and hatched baby chicks.
Since then, robots have come a long way, to be sure, and the field has evolved rapidly. A robotics engineer, therefore, creates robots that will do the things humans traditionally don’t want to do.
Orey says that most assembly lines today are far from being productive and this will become more apparent in the coming years. With the introduction of new robot lines and robots currently under development, the assembly line is likely to see rapid expansion.
OriGen is currently working on three assembly line technologies. One is a conveyor line that, without any human interaction, moves a steel machine to welding stations. The second is a laser-welding line that assembles systems in one step, reducing overhead. The final line is both of the above in one package with robotic arms assembling the structures. In the case of the last, the machine also carries the product where needed to be used.
Now, I don’t know about you, but one machine that cracks eggs and lets baby chicks hatch is a fine, fine thing indeed. As robots continue to evolve, we should expect to see a number of practical assembly line applications. In the process, human workers will move from the assembly line and more productive jobs.
Robots and human labor is not mutually exclusive. We’ll explore the latest tools for humans to use with robots to get more out of robots and out of human labor in the next issue.",456,4,2227

Here's a simple guide on how to get started with gardening for beginners:

1. Decide on a space: Choose a place in your yard or balcony that receives good sunlight, and that is easily accessible for maintenance.

2. Get your tools: Start with basic gardening tools such as a trowel, gloves, watering can, pruning shears and a garden hoe.

3. Select your plants: Choose plants based on your climate zone, sunlight exposure, water requirements and soil type. Start with easy-to-grow plants such as herbs, tomatoes, lettuce and flowers like marigolds and petunias.

4. Prepare the soil: Improve the soil quality by adding compost, organic matter, and fertilizer. Mix them together and add water to make the soil moist.

5. Plant your seeds: Dig small holes in the soil and plant your seeds or seedlings, making sure they are spaced out properly. Water them gently to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.

6. Maintain your garden: Regularly weed the garden, water plants, prune the growth as needed, and fertilize the soil to keep plants healthy.

7. Enjoy the fruits of your labor: Once your plants have grown, harvest your veggies, cut back the flowers and observe how your hard work has paid off. 

Remember, gardening is a wonderful way to relax, relieve stress, and spend time outdoors. Enjoy the process and have fun!

Can you give me some tips on how to deal with pests in my garden?

Yes, here are some tips on how to deal with pests in your garden:

1. Identify the pest: Before you start treating, identify the pest that is damaging your plants. Different pests require different treatments, so make sure you know what you're dealing with.

2. Use natural pest control methods: There are many natural pest control methods you can use, such as handpicking, companion planting, and using insecticidal soap or neem oil. These methods are safer for the environment and non-toxic to humans and animals.

3. Use physical barriers: Physical barriers can also be effective in deterring pests. For example, you can install row covers to protect your plants from pests like insects and birds.

4. Rotate your crops: Crop rotation is a natural method to manage pests. It helps to control the pests by breaking the pest-crop loop and reducing the populations of harmful insects.

5. Use natural pesticides: Natural pesticides like insecticidal soap, neem oil, and bacterial-based products can be effective in controlling pests",540,4,2440

Dear Dylan, Six months! A year! The dog! All love and lush puppy. A Venn diagram of dubious physics posited by St. Christopher's College freshman year and warmly reverberating one beautiful and harrowing trip to Grenada for a public gathering. Things lingers and my love grows, and thankfully, so does my understanding of you. Justifying my existence by looking around, there have been many occasions when you've inspired me to remember ""Mommy and Daddy love you!"" I imagine an adoring black and white dog below, and I repeat it to myself, like some kind of incantation. Dreams are hereditary, which I think leads to the question, where is the dog? I don't think it's here. Is it lost? Were you ever more interested? Or can I find it again through your retelling?
In terms of purports to the divine, is there still a God? I have surmised that a predetermined variety of applications will always apply; they are fictive creatures co-extensive with natural selection. Human history exhibits the salience and durability of a rose in a rose garden.
My impression is that original sense of my being has never been as indelible as it is now. I presume a deeper sense of our relationship, as a physical relationship; your gestures and my capacity to mentally simulate them make such yearnings more experiential.
Meaning sustains itself through an inscriptive velocity founded in the threat of newness. But the necessary first step must be emulation. To hold you in my arms, an offer which I find difficult to reject. An answer to Dylan-ectomy.

YouTube has a variety of user generated playlists with upbeat songs for workout motivation.
Don’t stress yourself out by not knowing what you should do next. Decide what you want to do and stick with it. Here’s a list of common exercises and there corresponding exercises you can perform.
Get fit by implementing flexibility exercises and stretching into your workout. Stretching can be achieved before and after the workout and is an essential key to preventing injury and improvement in your mobility. Flexible hips, and knees are important to reduce the risk of injury during weight lifting. Stretching can also improve your circulation and provide some relaxation. Every person wants a little bit of that.
To keep the body moving, there is nothing better than a cardiovascular workout. Running, cycling, rowing, or swimming are all good exercise for improving the cardiovascular health. At an optimal level, cardio exercise helps to maintain healthy cholesterol levels and blood pressure as well as strengthen the heart muscles and the immune system.
Sometimes your body needs a rest, but that doesn’t mean the training has to stop. An “active rest” is an essential part of fitness training, just like the rest periods between sets. Taking a brisk walk or jog is a great way to regain energy without stressing the body.
Your heart rate keeps time to the beat of the music, right?
Workouts are only as successful as the effort and thought put into them. Ready to begin a fitness regimen to improve your health, quality of life and fitness level? Check out the Matrix home fitness equipment, and don’t forget to take time to enjoy the music!",393,4,1975

In that respect, the writing of my PhD thesis has been influenced by the pursuit of updating Materia Medica as one way to step out of old-hegemonic vocabulary. I try to investigate in whose interest the ontological choice was made to report some objects as big, others as small, but, mostly, to refuse to distinguish colours of objects between healthy and deadly to transform them into medicines, in virtue of the produce of their origin in the mind.
Starting from Hesiod’s Theogony to Miguel Angel Lopez Ricon, through details from any pre-Columbian cosmos, the question is which ontological choices are historically socially constructed in the physical world. Have we evolved mythology? By going from Greek-Spartan mythological building to Ricon’s Chiapas construction, I claim, what might seem most worthy of mythological resources would appear to be in reality, a myth of human evolution.
To elaborate this idea, in my thesis, I perform a real anthropological process. I learned that Ricon’s organic understanding was inspired from a field-work from 1946-47. He observed ceremonies ritualised in the mangrove forest in Chiapas, in which ocelot is the main protagonist of a creation ritual. I consulted on this with Eilean Hooper-Greenhill, who invited me to meet him while he was in residence at the ZMBM. In 2017, he died. We travelled to Venezuela to visit my PhD and we filmed a deposition, from which we can extract the critical question of the existence of such wide-spread field-work by people like him. As Hofkapler-Greenhill put it, this is a general information we always wish for people to have, especially if we listen to their intellectual and spiritual stories. This also provided me with the opportunity to film Ricon in front of any autorectified tulipacu. Every time we used to meet, we observed the blue sky of the Andes reflected on this semi-transparent blue medicinal juice. I saw the landscape painting with which David Serrano painted Ricon’s cosmos. In London, he introduced me to Fulvio Melilli and Nicoletta Drago, working on Ricon’s frescoes. He introduced me to all his kinship. I talked about Ricon with Jean Aggazzotti and Marcel Brion in Geneva. I found out about the writings of Eugenio Torrens de Novoa. From my own",506,4,2321

The seven dance teachers in the College of the Arts will perform solo and group pieces as part of “Wild and Beautiful” on Feb. 24 at 8 p.m. at the Scarlett and Ralph Elliot Theater on Main Street in the Sprague Building.
Muriel Brown, chair of dance at UNCG, said this is the sixth “Wild and Beautiful” showcase in eight years. A goal, she said, has been to bring together a diversity of dance styles and choreographers.
“This year’s program includes faculty members who are very familiar with traditionals forms of dance, and who are always interested in stretching their creative boundaries,” said Brown.
Ellis Washington, the Tom and Mary Bradley professor of dance, said he is doing three dances this year. He performs with the Praise Dancers in “Please Not The Piano” and he is doing a trio “Sonnet” with two women. He also is appearing in “Sweet Home Alabama” with a cast of UNCG students, made up of 12 men and 16 women.
Washington said his dance, “Sweet Home Alabama,” is what he calls a “minor-minor” (minor in piano, minor in dance). In the music, in the spirit of Lionel Ritchie, he and the cast sing about how they came to love the school.
The 2015 inaugural showcase gave birth to the Splats Ensemble, an improvisational workshop led by Washington, James Thompson, Kerry Elliot and Mikell Tooms.
Washington said his piece that will be performed in the Feb. 24 event is designed to look at the spiritual and religious underpinnings of music and dancing. Washington said he does some practice African dancing, but he doesn’t use that in his piece. “The idea is: You can connect with God through dance,” he said.
Washington’s piece will be performed in an interpretation of black rock music from the 1970s. “We’re not going to do the actual music. We’re going to do what a black rock band would do, like Stevie Wonder, who I like. We’ll dress up in all black, shirtless, and use something like auto-harp or drum, with influences of other forms, such as Blues and the beatings of jazz and rock and roll,” he said.

- The smallest unit of energy in an atom is called a quantum. This is where quantum mechanics gets its name.
- In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states at once until they are observed.
- Scientists use wave-particle duality to explain how particles can behave both like waves and particles.
- Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of particles called ""superpositions"" that can exist in multiple states at once until observed.
- The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty.
- Quantum mechanics has been used to explain phenomena such as quantum tunneling, where particles can pass through barriers that should be impossible.
- Scientists have used quantum mechanics to create quantum computers, which are much faster and more powerful than traditional computers.

Archaeology has influenced our lives in many ways that are invisible to us. In this article, we will look at some of the effects of archaeology on society.
Archaeology influences daily lives in subtle ways that are often unnoticed. The average person interacts with archaeological artifacts every single day without being aware of it. Archaeology can have a significant effect on society as well.
Archaeology can help us understand who we are
The study of the past helps us understand who we are, where we came from and why we are here. It can also help us to recognize similarities between different cultures and how they have influenced one another. Archaeology can provide a deep insight into human history, such as when we talk about ancient civilizations.
This makes it easier for us to appreciate the diversity in the world around us by putting things into perspective and realizing how long ago they were created. This knowledge also helps us understand what has happened since those times – from discovering fire through modern technology that we use every day.
It helps us to understand ourselves and our ancestors
Archaeology can help us understand ourselves and our ancestors. We can see how our ancestors were like when they were alive – their customs and way of life. By looking at the artifacts of different cultures from all over the world, we can see how they lived and how they developed over time.
We can also learn about the history of our own country, which is important for understanding what it means to be an American. Archaeology provides a lot of information on Native Americans in the United States. This includes details about their lives as well as what happened when they first came to America.
Why study ancient cultures
The study of ancient cultures can teach us how people lived in the past. This knowledge can help us learn about our own culture and understand how it has developed over time.
The study of ancient cultures can also help us understand modern society by showing us how certain events in history have influenced modern culture. For example, the Renaissance was a time when people from different parts of Europe became interested in classical literature and art from ancient civilizations like Greece and Rome. This led to many things being based on Greek and Roman ideas, like architecture (buildings with columns) or even stories like Romeo & Juliet or Othello.
The study of ancient cultures can also show us how much has changed since those times – what we do now was impossible then! We can see this by looking at the different languages used at different periods of time and seeing how they evolved into different forms over hundreds or even thousands of",496,4,2706

2. Energy: Quantum mechanics is fundamental in understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules, which are crucial for the design and operation of various energy systems, such as solar cells and batteries.

3. Materials science: The properties of materials, such as their strength, conductivity, and optical properties, are often determined by their quantum structure, which is studied by quantum mechanics.

4. Medical science: Quantum mechanics is relevant in the study of molecular structures, which are important in drug discovery and design. It is also used to explain the behavior of electrons in the human body, which has implications for diagnosis and treatment of various diseases.

5. Computer science: Quantum mechanics is crucial in the development of quantum computers, which promise to revolutionize the field of computing.

Overall, quantum mechanics has had a profound impact on modern society, from the devices we use every day to the way we understand the world around us.

Wow, I had no idea that quantum mechanics had such a wide range of applications in modern society! It's amazing how much impact it has had on so many different fields.

Yes, it is amazing! Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory that has provided us with insights into the behavior of the subatomic world and has led to the development of technologies and inventions that we use in our daily lives. Quantum mechanics is an interdisciplinary field that brings together mathematics, physics, and computer science, and it continues to grow and evolve as we discover new applications for its principles. It has had an enormous impact on our understanding of the world, and we can expect to see many more exciting developments in the future as we continue to explore the possibilities of quantum mechanics.

It's crazy to think that something as small as a subatomic particle can have such a big impact on our daily lives. It really highlights the interconnectedness of everything in our universe.

Yes, it is truly fascinating and mind-boggling! The fact that the behavior of subatomic particles can have such a significant impact on our lives is a testament to the fact that everything in the universe is interconnected and interdependent. Quantum mechanics shows us the fundamental nature of the world around us and provides a new perspective on the universe.

# Do students generally underestimate the significance of model investigations?

Students often complete model investigations as part of their studies, but they may not always fully appreciate the significance and usefulness of these types of investigations. This study looks at when, and how, 12-13 year-old students conceptualise the purpose of model investigations and identifies strengths and weaknesses in this understanding. The study includes student interviews and a self-concept inventory based on Stevens and Plucker's (2007) framework. The findings indicated that students generally under-estimated the use of model investigations in physics and that they mostly used the same approach to complete an investigation, regardless of its title. There were indications that students' understanding of the significance of model investigations may be dependent on their prior experiences of them, and that this understanding may change with increased exposure. There was also some evidence that a more abstract, global approach to conceptualising the purpose of model investigations than one based on Stevens and Plucker's framework, may be beneficial.",204,4,1168
391,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", such as fields like space exploration or pollution, are readily apparent. For some less obvious science, the benefits can be hard to understand. But even for a more obscure concept, like energy conservation, even if it is difficult to understand all of the implications, it is still a noble endeavor.
It’s a useful energy concept that, in addition to being simple to understand and teach, can serve a very real purpose. In order to help you understand this concept, let’s get right to it with our review of energy conservation.
2 What Does it Mean to Conserve Energy?
4.1 What does it mean to conserve energy?
In general, the concept of energy conservation refers to the conservation of energy, or the idea that energy is conserved through interconversion. In many energy applications, particularly in power systems, there is a presence of energy demand, or specific devices, like electric power generators and motors, that produce energy.
Energy conservation can also refer to the concept of total available energy as well. In other words, in addition to conservation of energy in a conservation of energy in a power system, the concept of total energy conservation can refer to all usable sources and its related situations.
To further understand the general definition of energy conservation, we can look at the definition of energy, an essential concept in understanding how it is conserved. Energy is the capacity for doing work. In fact, energy itself is quite ubiquitous, as it is found in everyday occurrences and it is required to perform almost all basic actions. But what determines the difference between work being done or not, and why is energy conserved in some instances and not in others?
The answer to these questions is that energy is conserved through interconversion. In order for work to be performed, the potential and kinetic energy of an object have to change. And in other cases, the energy is stored in a form that can be converted from one form to another. To further understand these actions, let’s examine some examples of energy conservation in our everyday lives.
One of the easiest ways to understand energy conservation is that it provides us with a real-life reason to make energy efficiency in homes more appealing. Let’s consider a home that is built in a way that saves energy. One way to consider this is a home that has energy efficient windows, or a home built from natural materials, like cotton or concrete. Either way, energy savings are vital to the home’s existence. Of course, this type of energy conservancy is nothing new to us. Homes have always been the recipient of any",517,4,2623

The negative impact of these facts has created endless debates on how to handle certain situations. One of the main areas that psychology is involved in is what we call psychology's pain era. This article looks at the scientific aspects of pain and how it impacts society. It also looks at methods that can be used to help people with pain.
One of the main things that science has taught us about pain is that it is not an all-in-one experience. Many people experience pain, which is different than another person's pain. This is why studies show that pain suffers from delusions, excessive imagery and in extreme cases, hallucinations. Although there is no clear definition of pain, many people believe that it includes all kinds of sensations, even those that are completely non-existent or only temporary.
One of the big questions in psychology is the cause and effect relationship between pain and psychological disorders. One theory is that trauma and stress are the main causes of chronic pain. This would mean that certain types of mental health issues like anxiety and depression are also the result of trauma and stress. An alternative theory is that chronic pain is caused by traumatic and painful events, resulting in a build-up of stress and anxiety.
One area that has been widely studied is the relationship between pain and depression. There are many theories concerning the cause and effects of depression, including how it is the result of an overload of painful and negative feelings that end up being felt in the brain. The question of why depression is so prevalent among those who experience chronic pain is also important. One hypothesis is that those who are able to control their emotional pain through meditation or hypnosis may experience less pain overall. Those who have tried this method but don't seem to be able to reduce the severity of their pain may just need a little more time to develop the mental/emotional control techniques.
There is also a theory that it is possible to create pain without injury. Studies of brain function have found that an injury does not cause pain unless it is a real injury or a severe one. Some researchers suggest that some people can create a state of pain that feels like it is located outside of the body. Although this sounds odd, it does seem to be a very common occurrence with people who experience chronic pain.
It is important to remember that there are several forms of pain. Headache and earache are both considered painful symptoms of the body. In many cases, it is believed that the reason why someone may have this type of pain",523,4,2697

Telfair graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in 2005 with degrees in physics and English. He is now a professor at Blue Springs South High School in Blue Springs, Missouri, just outside Kansas City. As someone who has always been fascinated with physics, he wanted to take his passion to the classroom and get others excited about the subject.
Some students who might need help with physics in Kansas City decide not to take it because of bad experiences in the classroom. When asked if most of the students who enroll for physics at the high school don’t return for their junior year, Telfair said 30 to 40 percent of them transfer out. But when asked about why, he wasn’t sure.
“There’s a lot of misconceptions about the subject,” he said. Many students get a terrible first experience with physics. They might see it as homework problems with chalkboards and complicated equations.
Or, they might see people who are making fun of them as a child is falling through a trampoline and they miss the fact that they’re just joking.
“My first-year professors told me to approach the classroom with an open mind,” he said. And that is exactly what he did. He planned on being a physics teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District after his undergraduate years at Cal Poly Pomona. Since the district was too big, he asked to be placed at the smallest school he could. Although the move was initially planned to be a simple one-year stop, it ended up being his whole career.
Telfair said that he had some difficulties getting into teaching, even at the high school level. It took him a little over a year to find his footing in Kansas City and has been teaching there for four years now. He loves living in Blue Springs, where he has found the community supportive of his career choice.
“I wanted my students to know that learning physics has the potential to give them a greater understanding of the world and give them an advantage in a number of different fields of work,” he said. And, if that doesn’t work, he thinks knowing about physics will help them pass their MCATs or passing their driver’s tests, since many states require drivers to know about the quadratic function and car crash safety. After all, physics has applications in many different areas of life and Telfair wants to help his students see that.

Geology is the study of the Earth's physical structure, processes, and materials, with a focus on understanding its formation, development, and composition over time.

That's a very broad and comprehensive sentence about geology. Can you provide more details about the specific processes and materials that geologists study?
Certainly, geologists study a wide range of physical processes and materials, such as plate tectonics, volcanic activity, rock formations, minerals, and fossils. They also investigate the distribution and movement of Earth's natural resources such as minerals, oil, and gas, as well as the impact of human activities on the environment.

Can you give an example of a recent geological discovery that has changed our understanding of the Earth's past?
One recent geological discovery that has changed our understanding of the Earth's past is the finding of fossils of advanced species of animals such as dinosaurs in unexpected places like China, and North America. These fossils provide evidence of dinosaur activity during a time when the Earth's climate and environmental conditions were quite different from what they are today. The discovery of these fossils has given geologists a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's geological history and how organisms adapted to changing environments over time.

Wow, I had no idea that geologists could uncover fossils of advanced species of animals like dinosaurs. Can you tell me more about how they were able to identify the fossils and what their characteristics are?
Sure, geologists use several techniques to identify fossils, including observing the structure of the fossilized bones or other remains, their composition, and the environment in which they were discovered. 

For example, the fossils of dinosaurs are typically identified based on the shape, size, and structure of their bones and teeth. Geologists can also determine the age of the fossil by comparing the degree of decay and other microscopic evidence to radiometric dating techniques. 

The characteristics of a dinosaur include a four-legged vertebrate with a long tail, which suggests an arboreal or quadrupedal lifestyle. Their diet was predominantly herbivorous, and their behavior involved movement through the landscape, most often through a mixture of slow-paced walking, running, and agile bursts of movement.

Dinosaurs lived on Earth approximately 230 million years ago and existed until around 65 million years ago. The most well-known and diverse group of dinosaurs was the Sauropods, which were the largest land animals to ever exist and had long necks and tails, and small heads.",494,4,2661

After my class this morning, as I was getting ready to leave, my student, a woman with the name of Fatima, came up to me and said:

“Dear professor, I wanted to thank you. Your class makes me dream. It makes me believe that I can do this, that one day I will become an astronomer.”

It was when she started shaking my hand that I realised what the real power of teaching is. Her question resonated with something I had in my mind. That why astrophysics matters and that doing it and teaching it matters too.

She said that she loves to spend her free time watching episodes of the Universe, that it is one of the only American shows she watches because it shows the beauty of the universe and that she wants to study to know the truth. She said that watching shows like this, and imagining something more and bigger than herself, gives her more strength to fight problems in her life.

So, she wants to learn what is the difference between human understanding of things and what science says and after she said what she said, everything came together for me.

She’s at the age where it matters. She’s old enough to understand what science is. She’s young enough to believe that with a bit of work she can make a change. She’s still impressionable enough that she can be inspired. She’s still smart enough to really think about what science is. She still has the curiosity of a kid to explore the world.

On the other hand, how many students of mine in my astronomy class that have seen programs like this, that have read articles in science magazines, that have talked to scientists or that have been to a planetarium since we had class and read papers on science in the news since we had class, are actually interested in studying astrophysics? And this is without taking into account all the students who have gone through my physics class.

Furthermore, how can we use encryption to ensure the security of our sensitive data in the age of identity theft and data breaches? Could you provide us with a code example of how to properly encrypt and decrypt data using Python?

Cryptography is the process of converting ordinary data into a coded language that cannot be understood by anyone who does not have the key to decode it. Cryptography works by using a combination of mathematics, computer science, and cryptography to protect data.

In Python, encryption can be done using several built-in libraries like Cryptography, PyCrypto, etc. The most commonly used one is Cryptography. Below is a simple example of how encryption works in Python:

```
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a key to encrypt the data
key = Fernet.generate_key()

# Create an instance of Fernet to encrypt the data
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

# Define the data to be encrypted
data = b""This is the data to be encrypted.""

# Encrypt the data using the cipher suite
encrypted_data = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)

# Print the encrypted data

```

In the above code, we have imported the Fernet class from the Cryptography library and generated a key to encrypt the data. We have then created an instance of the Fernet class and used it to encrypt the data. Finally, we have printed the encrypted data.

To decrypt the data, we can use the same key used to encrypt the data:

```
# Define the key used to encrypt the data
key = Fernet.generate_key()

# Create an instance of Fernet to decrypt the data
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

# Define the encrypted data to be decrypted
encrypted_data = b""This is the encrypted data.""

# Decrypt the data using the cipher suite
decrypted_data = cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_data)

# Print the decrypted data
print(decrypted_data.decode())
```

In the above code, we have defined the key used to encrypt the data and created an instance of the Fernet class to decrypt the data. We have then defined the encrypted data to be decrypted and used the cipher suite to decrypt it.

Many of us turn to nutrition advice as we start on our health and wellness journey. In many cases, people start to experience a positive change in their physique, energy levels and general wellbeing as a result of nutrition. It is especially important to understand what nutrients our body needs to keep us healthy.
Read this beginner's guide to nutrition to get started in a health & fitness journey
There are a lot of confusing terms being thrown around the nutrition world these days, which can be daunting for beginners. But it's not nearly as difficult as it seems, as there is no need to spend hours in the gym or complex recipes to start getting fit. By changing one or two things in your diet, you can transform the body you have into the physique you want.
From the food you eat, to the environment it's cooked in, the way it's stored, how it's prepared and the way you prepare it, to the portion size you eat, the way you take your nutrients can make a massive difference in your weight and how you feel.
What is a diet?
A diet is a shortened term for ""eating habits"", or you could say ""how we eat"". However, many people think that a diet is just what you eat. You may be surprised to know this is not entirely true.
When it comes to nutrition, a diet is the way in which you eat. It is your overall eating habits, whether you have three meals a day or four meals a day, have fruit or junk food and what you eat in them, along with all the other things you do when it comes to eating.
The most important thing is you need to have a food diary, which is a food list of all the food you eat, including snacks and drinks. If you are not sure what you eat, this tool can be very useful.
Here is a simple guide on how to start your journey to better nutrition:
Calories in vs. calories out
Every diet is based on calories. In simple terms, they are the energy your body uses and they are the most important thing to know when it comes to food and weight loss.
Your body is in a constant state of caloric deficit or surplus. This means that it is always consuming energy from the food you eat. For example, when you have breakfast you consume calories for the food you eat. If you don't eat enough, your body will begin to store energy in the form of fat.
The problem with some diets is that",524,4,2319

Scientific research is completed through multiple steps, each of which is associated with specific topologies. An algorithmic framework is proposed to identify the high-dimensional patterns for characterizing a scientific research process. In this framework, current publications are formed into an overlapping classification network, which is dynamically structured and dynamically modified. A shared manifold metric is then used to identify how high-dimensional local patterns of publications co-evolve together, and how such patterns could be effectively used to describe and trace the complex research process. Statistical results of experimental results in comparing clustering with traditional spectral analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. This approach can be easily applied to other distributed data that follows a community structure model, and can be used to serve as a generic method for dynamic network research in other interdisciplinary applications.",205,4,1221

As long as there have been costumes, people have had opinion. The idea of a gown is to find one that makes the wearer appear chic and graceful, so if you're wearing it well then no one should notice if your top sleeve is a centimetre to the left. Fashion is very very subjective and personal and you may have many people in your life that don't like the same outfits as you, but you still should do what makes you comfortable. That's important and other than that the world is your oyster!
In any business you need to be confident. True, it's hard to have confidence if you haven't bought clothes you like – you feel naked because you don't have anything in your wardrobe to wear on nights out, but even if you don't like shopping you need to practice. Pick an outfit that is easy to wear or pick a favourite. Shopping can be time consuming and frustrating – the truth is not every shop has something for you, and it's easier to be apprehensive and stay home than to try on a pile of clothes and end up with nothing, but if you try everything on and make a list of what you like or don't like, it's easier for next time. If you don't go shopping then you may only have expensive and impractical things in your wardrobe and it's time consuming to make things work with what you have. Another way to find inspiration is in the press. Use the newspapers and internet fashion pages as well as your favourite magazines to see what kind of things you like – then just try to copy those designs or be inspired by them. Nobody will mind if you put in a few changes like take a pair of tights from a different shop and adding a flower from the hardware shop. (For a style lesson see the ""how-to's"" at the bottom of this article.) Have fun with your clothes, it's supposed to be a fashion adventure!
Tips on how to dress well:
It takes time to find your personal style – don't give up and try everything on that catches your eye! Wear colourful, interesting tops with navy bottoms – over-dressing should be about effort not colour. Try wearing off-beat accessories like a funky scarf and quirky shoes with plain clothes. Don't just wear heels with dresses – try tennis shoes on occasion as well. Don't be afraid of accessories or patterns, but just have fun!",509,4,2257

Fashion refers to styling, dress style, ideas, theories, tastes, ideas and types of people. Personal style is fashion related to one’s own expression of their personality. For a perfect look, it is important to follow a few fashion tips.
Have your own fashion style
A lot of people mix clothes thinking that it is the best thing to do but no, in order to look perfect you need to have your own fashion style. In order to have it, you need to find something that suits you very well. You can think of it as an outfit or style that you get feel of for yourself. Hence the way you go about your life matters, the places you go out and who you are. You need to dress in a way that makes you feel good and happy.
For the perfect you
On one hand, you need to know your style you can wear but at the same time, you also need to know what suits your body shape. A beautiful dress can be the best looking thing in the world but if it fits you wrong, then it can mess up your entire appearance. Also, you need to be careful about your skin tone. For example, if you have cool skin tone and have fair skin then you can wear all the bright colors. However, if you have warm or neutral skin tone then you should wear toned down or neutral colors. However, this is just a general guidance you need to know more about your body type and skin tone.
Be brave
Bravery does not mean that you need to be adventurous about your outfit. When we say bravery, you need to be aware of what suits you and what does not. Be wise about your fashion and look in a way that you have always wanted. The best advice that you can get about fashion is by discussing with your partner or if you feel like not doing it then consult a fashion expert.",392,4,1798

Cryptography is the practice of securing communication and data by transforming it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized parties. It involves the use of mathematical algorithms and encryption techniques to protect sensitive information from being intercepted, read, or altered during transmission. Cryptography is essential for maintaining privacy and security in today's digital age, where information is often transmitted over networks and stored in various devices.

A complex encryption algorithm is an advanced technique used to encrypt data securely. One example of such an algorithm is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is widely adopted and considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms in use today. AES was introduced by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 and has since become the standard for various government and commercial applications.

AES uses a secret key to perform its encryption and decryption process. It operates on blocks of data, typically 128 bits in size, and applies a series of complex mathematical operations to transform the plaintext (unencrypted data) into ciphertext (encrypted data). The key plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of these operations, making it an essential component for ensuring the security of the encryption.

To decrypt the ciphertext, the receiving party uses the same secret key and applies the inverse operations of the encryption process to retrieve the original plaintext. This process ensures that only those with the correct key can access and understand the encrypted data.

AES provides a high level of security due to its complexity and wide range of key sizes (128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit). The larger the key size, the more difficult it is to crack the encryption using brute-force methods, as the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the key length.

In summary, cryptography is a crucial concept for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data in today's digital world. AES is an example of a complex encryption algorithm that utilizes advanced mathematical operations to transform plaintext into ciphertext, providing a high level of security and protection against unauthorized access.",445,4,2335

The Science Behind Artificial Intelligence
- What is artificial intelligence?
- What is predictive analytics?
- What is machine learning?
Artificial intelligence or “AI” can be described as the ability of a computer to think and act like a human, with the aid of algorithms and advanced information technology. For example, algorithms tell a computer system how to recognize information (storing and retrieving and sorting data).
AI can now be best utilized in various commercial markets, such as sales, where machine learning, a type of AI is used. Machine learning is generally developed using the algorithms that augment data processing. It means the data will be trained to learn from our responses to it and optimize at being able to predict what future outcomes may be.
What is predictive analytics?
Predictive analytics is the process of drawing inferences from past events, which leads to future actions that can be beneficial. It’s a field of big data analytics that uses advanced statistical techniques to predict future trends and events. It uses AI (in the form of machine learning) to sift through billions of data points, looking for patterns and correlations that can uncover insights.
A Predictive Approach to Analytics in Sales
Smart businesses recognize predictive analytics as a strategic competitive edge. In an environment where there’s a growing level of competition to match and exceed the needs of customers, executives know that an organization needs the tools to stay ahead of the curve. There are also many factors that can affect the sales process, like the economy, new legislation, public health issues, even natural disasters, meaning predicting future outcomes for an organization is paramount to growth, success, and maintaining growth in any field.
How Does Predictive Analytics Work in Sales?
Sales teams looking to implement analytics platforms into their sales strategy will benefit from having their sales process utilize predictive analytics to their benefit. In a nutshell, predictive analytics can help drive faster, smarter, and more consistent growth by helping sales leaders identify top prospects, streamline their sales pipeline, increase efficiency, and grow revenue.

It is becoming possible to observe actual processes of life at work in an experimental mode. A systematic, (although quite unsystematic) study of nature itself is leading to a novel perspective on the fundamental nature of life.
We shall be in a position to reveal, with a high degree of confidence, the actual nature of life. There is the possibility of knowing what life is like directly, and not merely on the basis of merely subjective and theoretical or hypothetical conjecture. Until now we have had to content ourselves with mere conjectures about life. We can now be making observations of life itself. It is of the greatest moment that we take seriously the philosophy of science and realize that there is a wonderful diversity of vital experience lying before us.
In retrospect, of course, we can reflect back upon life, recognize certain general laws of physics and ""life experiences"" and so forth, but this was only made possible in retrospect. What is most interesting is that we do not have to ""invent the wheel"" and reinvent the fact that there is a tremendous amount of material and immediate experience to be dealt with now. If we recognize this, we can utilize and develop this ready-made basis for new wisdom.
We can, for example, look at biology and see that it is, indeed, a great diversity and richness of empirical material, yet we can recognize that it is fundamentally incomplete. No description of life can be complete in terms of a particular ideological approach. Fundamental theory or approach -- such as the idea of ""evolution"" -- give an inadequate perspective and inadequately explain the basic nature of life.
The idea of ""spontaneous order"" also can be seen to be significantly flawed. Life is not simply order. It is disorder, it is variety, it is individual development and expression, it is cohesion, it is cooperation, and it is contribution. It is a totally unique and rich developmental experience, which is capable of being described, of being systematized, of being clarified, of revealing the actual nature of life. Yet all of this requires a totally new approach.
We are going to have to develop a whole new theory of life and, perhaps even more importantly, there will need to be a totally new social theory of the nature of life. This should be a new approach to philosophy, which is capable of serving as the most fundamental basis for social theory.

414,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is fundamental to the practice’s success. As an in-depth approach to body-mind awareness, it is a vehicle for experiencing the potential of positive change in our lives. Simply put, this ancient practice works. Meditation has contributed to numerous scientific studies that have shown its many benefits to psychological and physical health. While research is at times conflicted on some of these subjects, other results have shown promising results in areas such as cardiovascular health, stress relief and reduction of pain.
While all people in general, regardless of lifestyle, seek to be happy and fulfilled, stress is a constant obstacle to overcome. That is one of the primary reasons so many people turn to meditation as a helpful method to balance the mind and reduce stress. Below are some of the many benefits of meditation.
Meditation is effective because it encourages positive thought and action. Regular practice helps us become more aware of our thoughts and learn to alter our emotions to more positive and constructive ones. Thinking good thoughts promotes well-being. Based on these more positive thoughts, the mental process generates calmness, which inevitably leads to happiness. Controlling your thoughts is an important part of positive thinking, and meditation is an excellent method for developing this skill.
Meditation not only helps you manage your stress, but it also alters your stress response. One of the most common conditions of the modern, fast-paced age is the stress-response, a sympathetic response to events of life, and an overreaction to minor problems. Meditation helps you notice what events trigger this “in-a-frenzy response” and helps you change it. When the sympathetic nervous system is activated, it sends hormones throughout the body. It also affects the autonomic nervous system, which controls heart rate and blood pressure. Prolonged stress causes both to shoot up.
One of the most powerful impacts of meditation is to learn how to relax. Relaxation does not mean sleep or to stop thinking. It means to let go of thoughts, in order to gain awareness of the present moment. Awareness is the key to understanding stress, which leads to the next benefit of meditation.
Stress becomes much more manageable, even after acute stress has been triggered, when your awareness informs you of your physical and emotional reactions to certain situations. The ability to recognize stress in the body and awareness of the thoughts behind it are two of the biggest benefits of meditation. Through meditation, you will learn what’s working in your body and mind. Not only do you learn to recognize problems, but you also learn how to alleviate problems when they arise.

戈尔兰油田位于北部城市迈苏拉的东南方约60公里处，是伊拉克主要油田之一，也是伊拉克最重要的油田，年产原油约1000万吨，占伊拉克石油总产量的三分之一。在此之外，该油田的天然气产量约占伊拉克天然气产量的80％，是波斯湾沿岸最大的天然气田之一，是伊拉克和周边国家天然气生产的主要基地。
伊拉克政府正在充分运用戈尔兰油田现有的天然气管道网，将天然气向离、科威特和沙特阿拉伯等周边国家，以及苏丹、阿富汗、巴基斯坦等中近东国家供电。这一计划中有一段将从巴格达到科威特、沙特阿拉伯的天然气管道。天然气管道中的装置采用世界最优的西方技术，工程师和技术员也均来自西方国家。工程的费用估计会达到30亿美元。如果通过这一计划，伊拉克每年的天然气利润就将达到10亿美元。
估计该油田目前仍蕴藏石油100亿桶。该油田曾于1974年进行过“试油”，当时测出的原油产气率为367立方千米/立方米，天然气比",661,4,1103

Is Python a language for big projects?

If you intend to make something that requires lots of work hours, a decent amount of IO bound and backend computation, this might be the case. It can handle both graphical and more classic console interface applications.

There are different major frameworks one can use to build nice looking applications and other nice GUI interfaces (QApplication being the most common, pygame being the preferred for this). On the other side the use of sockets can be usefull for any networking purpose.

There is a pile of math engine libraries that you can use to perform any kind of computation you want, most of the times they contain more numerical accuracy than it is usually expected from mathematica, and are in general very reliable.

The answer can also be otherwise.

Python is a great language for prototyping very fast and it also perfectly adapted to data science. But if one is more interested in parsing large file amount of data from a database or else, using Python could be sometimes way slower than using other more specialized languages, like C or Java.

Which is the best IDE to use?

This is a subjective choice, some prefer to use very light editors like vim, others prefer to have the gui window all of it in emacs. However there is not a best IDE for Python, which is more like a task tool.

Installing Python and what are the supported operating systems and Python versions?

First of all one needs to have the correct Python environment and be able to properly interact with it.

Note: if you have an older installation you could have to reinstall it.

You can find links to download Python installation file on http://www.python.org/download/

Basically one can download executable packages and put it in the custom folder where one intends to run it, or install it through anaconda.

Anaconda is a set of libraries and packages from which one can start off and install new packages, so far it is more complete than the standard python, which might be very useful. Basically it creates conda environments, which are groups of libraries, so multiple uses of python can be done simultaneously without any interference.

The online interface for anaconda https://anaconda.org/ gives you the ability to build a specific package and to install it for all (not too complex to do).

Alternatively one can just install the libraries and packages manually. All of the frameworks can be downloaded from their official repository.

The official Python documentation lists all the modules that one can install from source. It also explain how one can build from scratch. There are lots of options, and",544,4,2671

Astronomy impacts us in countless ways—from understanding the world, to exploring the universe and even to the power of insight, inspiration and foresight for humanity. And, it’s not just the information generated from the research that is impacting society, as the understanding and understanding of astronomy comes from everyday observation.
Yet, daily life, even as it seems routine, is permeated by astronomy and its discovery. Astronomy has revolutionized our understanding of the world. By discovering new fundamental concepts and techniques, we have transformed our understanding of everything around us, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies. Here are some ways astronomy impacts our daily lives:
How Astronomy Impacts Our Daily Life: Traveling
Many people still recall that time when their favorite astronomy program used to take the viewer on a journey to the stars. Today, we can travel to those places, even though they might be hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Whether it be the auroras or the planets, we are finding these celestial bodies more accessible than ever before. In fact, our space-based telescopes are making it possible to see things that were impossible just a few decades ago. This is why many astronomers love astronomy so much.
How Astronomy Impacts Our Daily Life: Food
Food is something that we consume daily and for many of us, it is the only meal of the day. However, many people don’t realize that their choices about which food they consume has a direct impact on their health, especially when it comes to eating plenty of fiber, protein, and healthy fats. And even if you don’t like the taste of something, you are still consuming it. Therefore, a study conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the American Heart Association revealed that there is an increase in deaths due to food allergies and asthma among Americans.
How Astronomy Impacts Our Daily Life: Education
How much of education depends on astronomy? We know that many students view the night sky as a way of learning new things and gaining knowledge, and many of them would love to become astronomers someday. According to a study conducted by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, there has been a steady decline in enrollment in astronomy classes since the early 20th century. Even though the rate of enrollment has been slowing down, it is still higher than the rate of enrollment in other subjects.

The use of photography in a world that is increasingly out of control was not even imaginable in the 1920s when the world saw the last of the Black Sun Books. The most exciting image on the page (a photograph) was a small representation of a medium that consumed entire pages, and that that all art forms were preparing to devour. Now we have embraced photography as no other art form before it, and in turn, the photography changed daily life as it did not exist before.
With the ever expanding growth of the world’s population, the nature of its on hold markets are no longer confined by the nature of a geographic location, but by the nature of the world. The urbanization of our environment has increased the total number of people that live within an urban area by a third (Wilde 344). What this has done has made the world extremely global and has shaped the world image. With each passing day, the old national identity is being replaced with a new one that is aptly global, driven by the images, sounds, and phenomenon of a postmodern culture.
Even though humanity always was and always will be as one species, through the use of photography and the inclusion of the media, humanity is being transformed from a mere collection of individuals to a group of people with a common image that is shared and understood throughout the world. When it comes to photography, especially with the industry of nudes, this transformation has taken a turn to what was previously considered taboo. When looking at this side of image culture, we see that whatever will be accepted into society will be an evolution of that previously accepted. The penetration of photographs and images in consumer culture has shifted with that shift of culture. Early to mid-twentieth century photography created a debate on the contents of images that was long-ignored due to a stubborn insistence on the well-founded division between art and commercial purposes.
One such example of this was a widely-circulated erotic scene, which is a scandal in modern day life, but in the 1920s was perfectly acceptable to be published in photography. People were ashamed to view such images of their own sexuality. It was not until photography came into the picture that the idea was accepted within society.",502,4,2557

Cooking your own food isn’t just more fun, it also makes sense in terms of value and health. Nourishing our kids with a healthy diet isn’t just beneficial for their weight, energy levels, their appearance and their happiness; it’s also the best way to learn about food. Food is something we all take for granted, but by cooking it from scratch ourselves we learn not only about what we’re putting into our bodies, but also about what is involved in growing and producing it.
But food – and the vital role it plays in our lives – doesn’t come naturally. In the average day, we are programmed to reach for the most convenient foods that are available to us and given that these are often packed full of sugar, salt and fat and lacking in key nutrients, we are not only consuming foods that will cause us to pile on the pounds but also that are contributing to heart disease, diabetes and other chronic diseases.
Moreover, our children are being far less adventurous with food, too. Less than half of eight to 11-year-olds eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and more than 35% don’t eat enough calcium. Those who participate in the 5 A DAY programme eat fewer calories and make healthier food choices. They also consume more fibre, are more active and have fewer behavioural problems at school. In short, it’s all in the menu. But, to make these changes, first of all the role of cooking needs to be emphasised – our children need to get in the kitchen!
If your family isn’t cooking at all right now, what are you waiting for? It’s never too early to start – the earlier the better! If you have kids younger than five, start by involving them in preparing food – you might need help with the meal in the beginning, but you need to make it fun for them. If you can, get them involved in the picking of fruit and vegetables in the supermarket and encourage them to smell and get to know flavours. After that, just let them play! There will come a point when you need to start introducing ingredients that they are not familiar with and you may be quite tentative yourself; you need to give them time to get to know these new tastes, they’ll need to be introduced in small quantities. When trying new foods, offer them as part of a meal rather than alone. They need to get used to eating all the components together, then, in time, you can",522,4,2407

It promotes individual responsibility toward the earth and any person that has the goal of preserving the ecosystem for future generations. 

Question: Why is 'nature' considered to be 'beautiful' when it doesn't serve any purpose on earth?
Nature is considered to be 'beautiful' because it is a reflection of the way humans perceive and interact with the earth. Nature promotes individual responsibility towards the earth and the preservation of the ecosystem for future generations[1], and has a calming and peaceful effect on people due to the positive association it has with nature as a whole, and familiarity with nature in general[2]. Nature is seen as something positive and rewarding because it gives life to ourselves and others and nourishes and enlivens us[3]. Human nature can also be described as a combination of the uniquely social aspects of our behaviour and the unique qualities that distinguish human beings from animals[4]. Ultimately, nature is important for everyone because it promotes care, healthy life, and high-quality societies[5].",237,4,1198

Whereas expert systems reached a plateau some time ago, one of the most promising trends in AI is the rise of deep learning. Given an appropriate feature representation, for example, a large and consistent dataset, it allows machines to identify and respond to complex signals in the data.
Despite the many applications of deep learning, including image recognition and text analysis, researchers in the healthcare space are still trying to figure out how to use it to address the most pressing questions.
“It’s a very early field,” says Dr. Arvind Raghu, PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto and the Head of the computer vision research team at the Vector Institute. “It’s both exciting and challenging. We are just at the start and I think the world needs a lot more expertise in this area if we want to make impactful use of it.”
Regulating Deep Learning in Healthcare
As the first true revolution in computing in the last few decades, deep learning is also happening to us and disrupting the markets we have grown to rely upon. Since it is a tool that was originally trained and created to best understand patterns, machine learning tools can easily spot potentially damaging patterns in medical data, and could therefore be used to identify a range of serious concerns.
Rather than identifying the existence of an anomaly or the potential presence of an illness, however, deep learning has the ability to spot patterns and detect groups of individuals who may be susceptible to a particular type of illness, and predict their likelihood of engaging in risky behaviours. Data on family history, for example, has been extensively studied and can be inferred.
“We don’t need a big dataset to show us how to predict what is going to happen in a thousand years,” explains Raghu. “We can use tools like big data and machine learning to make predictions about disease and death – to show us how many people will be affected in the next five to 10 years.”
Indeed, since deep learning is dependent on large, consistent, carefully-annotated datasets, the technology presents challenges for healthcare. Deep learning systems, for example, would be classified as proprietary if they used algorithms that could not be reproduced by third parties. In the healthcare space, this could spell trouble because, as other companies create models using the same data, patients might be treated differently, despite being in the same category.
“It’s almost like medical regulations prohibit data scientists from building a model,” says Raghu. “When your only criteria is that there is a consistent set of features that has been collected, patients will",528,4,2686

Climate change has already had an impact on traditional forms of architecture around the world. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and more frequent droughts and floods are forcing people to adapt to new ways of living and building. Climate change also challenges the values and aesthetics associated with traditional architecture, forcing architects and builders to consider new forms and materials that can withstand the changing climate.

For example, traditional Indonesian buildings are being modified to reduce their susceptibility to flooding and landslides. In coastal areas, architects and builders are using local materials like bamboo and coconut leaves to create houses that can withstand the force of the sea. In sub-Saharan Africa, drought-resistant building materials are being used in rural communities, while in Arctic communities, new forms of insulation are being developed to withstand the extreme cold.

The cultural significance of architecture has always been tied to its unique identity and the values that underpin it. The loss of traditional forms of architecture can have profound cultural and social impacts. For example, in parts of Asia, traditional temple architecture is an integral part of cultural heritage that defines local identity. Similarly, in South Africa, traditional thatched-roof structures are an important part of cultural heritage and tourism.

Climate change has already begun to challenge these cherished forms of architecture, and architects are responding with new strategies and materials to build structures that can withstand the changing climate. The preservation of traditional architecture and its unique identity is critical to maintaining cultural continuity and promoting environmental sustainability.

It's amazing how resilient and adaptable the traditional forms of architecture can be. Can you give more examples of how climate change is affecting different regions of the world? Sure, here are a few more examples of how climate change is affecting traditional architecture around the world:

1. The Middle East: In the Middle East, rising temperatures are causing desertification and increasing the frequency of heatwaves, which are leading to the decline of traditional earthen architecture. Local building materials are also becoming scarce due to overuse and illegal logging, forcing architects and builders to turn to more modern materials.

2. North America: In northern regions of North America, traditional log houses are being impacted by rising temperatures and melting permafrost. Log houses built on unstable soil are at risk of collapsing, and many are being rebuilt with modern materials that are better able to withstand the changing climate.

3. South America: In many parts of South America, traditional adobe houses are at risk due to melting glaciers and increasing rainfall. Adobe is a type of earthen building",521,4,2993

I love borders. Of all the things I like to collect, be it stamps, postcards, coins or flags, borders seem to be the most fascinating and beautiful. But more than that, borders are the most representative feature of countries. Borders are the memory of the growing complexity of states and it is interesting to notice how these borders have changed over time. But what happens when borders change? When borders move or are moved? Of course, a lot. But, borders also influence people's decisions when they want to cross them. In the last few years I have read a lot about migrations. How they are often a result of political decisions, how many countries are still using specific migration laws, how migrants are sometimes pushed to flee their country. In 2016, before having been elected as Trump, there was the scary talk that was repeated ad nauseam on the news channels: Mexico would soon pay for the wall. I wonder what it would feel like to live in a country with a border constantly changing. I can imagine the fear, the stress and the paradox of being protected, but at the same time not being protected at all. Indeed, creating a border without reinforcing it with concrete walls or barbed wire does not mean keeping people out, in some cases it just means letting them through more easily, unbarred.
During my last holiday, I visited Budapest. A few years ago I had visited it, mainly because I wanted to see the Parliament, which I found really impressive. I then visited the City Park, where there is the aquarium and a planetarium. On one of the visits I got a little lost and instead of taking the usual way back to the area in which I had stayed I decided to take a different path. Crossing a bridge, following signs, I decided to take the street that runs along a river. It was 19:00, the sky was getting darker and, although the temperature was still pretty high, I was starting to feel the cold. As I got closer to the border I started wondering about people who, by chance, must cross it every day. While I was walking I saw two railway tracks crossing a road. They were very close to the river and above all they were wide and untended. I wondered what would happen if an angry Hungarian shepherd from the other bank crossed them by accident, causing the railway to collapse in a great avalanche and kill hundreds of people. Hungary might just have no choice but to let the Germans buy land to build a fence, in",510,4,2433

Some people are born with that ability. Others have to be coached and directed to learn and practice it to the highest level. In To Kill a Mockingbird, based on the Harper Lee book, director Brit Whitfield guides his cast of Auburn University students to portray this level of realism and to take the story to a level that reminded those who might not have heard of it that the story is the heart of why it is so important and why its message is still so vital today.
The story is set during the 1930s in a small town in Alabama. It focuses on two young children, Scout and Jem Finch, who are dealt the challenge of the racism and prejudice of their town when an integrated couple arrives in town. When they, an innocent white girl, is raped, the town’s white elite decide to put an innocent black man on trial for a crime he didn’t commit, despite the fact that there is physical evidence that he had nothing to do with it. Finch, who is a lawyer, finds himself pulled into the drama of it all, defending a man who does not deserve the accusation and damage that will be leveled against him. Meanwhile, Scout comes to a different understanding of the word “nigger” as she goes to court and becomes more cognizant of the fact that life is not black or white.
This is a wonderful story and is one of those stories, although not intentionally, about what makes us who we are and that the actions of others can change how we react. This is a story that is about fighting for justice, fighting for truth, and fighting to do what is right, no matter what the outcome. It is also a story about understanding, as Scout begins to come to grips with the fact that she can not see herself as superior to her black peers, and is that she is a racist because she has the wrong understanding of those people.
With those aspects of the story in mind, as well as the importance of such a story in our country’s past, it is interesting to note that Mr. Whitfield has asked the children’s grandfather to come on stage before the beginning of the play and make a statement to the audience about racism, about the importance of understanding our past, and about the potential of race relations in our country, especially with the election of our first",512,4,2429

The primary cause is due to long term poor lifestyle. There is a solution for every problem. In simple words, Health is associated with the diet, sleep, exercise, environment etc. In this article, I will discuss the basic nutrition for athletes.
· Incase you are looking for normal gym body, you might not need any other supplement. In that case, 2000 calories each day is sufficient. Weight is an important factor that determines the calorie consumption. Persons with higher weight will need higher calories.
· Protein: Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscles. A good amount of protein is necessary for the construction of a powerful body. Any athlete who wishes to build up muscle mass will have to follow a protein rich diet. Protein helps in muscle growth. Fat mobilisation takes place when there is a surplus of energy. High level of protein and low level of carbohydrates can increase the risk of brain swelling. It can also lead to a stress reaction in the body. All the patients should take a healthy amount of protein per day. How much protein a person requires depends on his current weight and energy consumption. The standards of protein intake is around 0.4 to 0.8 grams of protein in one kilogram of body weight. Sports-person can take a protein rich diet which consists of fish, egg white, milk, soy products, soy protein or branched-chain amino acids. These foods are a great source of protein. You can also eat chicken, meat, lean fish etc.
· Carbohydrate: It provides the body with its own supply of energy. It is a significant source of energy and it has been proven that less amount of carbohydrate is associated with the reduced mental performance. The adequate amount of carbohydrate is helpful in avoiding low blood sugar levels in the body. The recommendations for carbohydrate intake of athletes include 2.7 to 4.5 grams per each kilogram of body weight. You can consider sucrose or glucose. Athletes can consume energy bars or energy drinks. You can consume an energy drink every two hours for the prevention of hypoglycemia.

Geology is the study of Earth's structure and composition, and the processes that shape it. It involves understanding the physical and chemical properties of rocks, minerals, and other materials found within the Earth's crust. Geologists use various techniques to study the Earth, including the study of natural landmarks such as mountains, valleys, rivers, and caves, and the analysis of geological data collected through fieldwork, such as GPS, remote sensing, and radar mapping.

Geology can be divided into three main branches:

1. Geophysics: This branch of geology studies the physical properties of the Earth, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and the Earth's magnetic field.

2. Geology: This branch of geology studies the composition and structure of the Earth, including the Earth's layers, the composition of rocks and minerals, and the distribution of minerals and ores.

3. Petrology: This branch of geology studies the composition and properties of rocks, including igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks.

Geology plays a critical role in understanding the Earth's history, processes, and potential. It helps scientists understand natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis, and enables the development of strategies to mitigate their impact. Geologists also help us understand the Earth's climate, tectonic plates, and the geologic history of our planet.

The history of cooking is a vast and rich story that spans back tens of thousands of years. Here is a brief overview of the key developments and innovations in the art of cooking throughout history.

Prehistoric Times:

- The earliest known evidence of human cooking is carbonized plant and animal remains found in China that date back to around 29,000-30,000 years ago.
- Early humans likely used fire to cook their food, as shown by the discovery of heated stones used for cooking in Africa.
- During this time, humans also developed the ability to store food in caves, which protected it from spoilage and allowed for longer journeys.

Bronze Age (3000-1200 BC):

- The use of bronze tools for cooking emerged during this time, allowing for more efficient and precise cooking methods.
- Bronze cooking pots and skillets were used for roasting, stewing, and baking, as well as preparing fermented drinks.

Iron Age (800-400 BC):

- During this time, iron replaced bronze as the primary material for cooking tools.
- Skillet sizes increased significantly, and the development of specialized pots like the Chinese jadala and Dutch oven made cooking easier and more efficient.
- The use of ceramic pots and bowls became more common, and they were decorated with intricate designs and colorful glazes.

Ancient Rome:

- Roman cooking techniques included roasting, grilling, and baking, and Romans were known for their excellent preserved meat dishes.
- The concept of ""boiling"" was also developed during this time, as seen in recipes for fish in highly seasoned liquid.

Middle Ages:

- European cuisine was heavily influenced by the Islamic culture during this period, with many dishes originating from the Middle East.
- Recipes were often passed down through generations and included detailed instructions for seasoning, cooking, and preserving food.
- People also began to eat different meals at different times of day, with breakfast, lunch, and dinner becoming more common.

Renaissance:

- The Renaissance saw a renewed interest in elaborate culinary techniques, with wealthy families often hiring ""cooks"" (chef de cuisine) to create elaborate meals for their banquets.
- In addition, the first known cookbook, the Libro de Dieci Cucina (""Book of Ten Cooks""), was published in Spain in 1495.

They include mutations, natural selection, sexual reproduction, genetics drift and gene flow among others. Understanding these factors is key to the evolution of any gene and hence the organisms.
Mutation happens due to a random alteration in the genes of an organism. Mutations take place every minute and although some of them are harmless, others cause genetic defects in an organism. Several factors affect mutation including radiation, chemical reaction, cosmic rays and free radicals.
Natural selection occurs when there is a variation in the characteristics of organisms and is best described by the statement ‘Survival of the fittest’. During natural selection, the organism in the species with the most desirable characteristics survives as its different characteristics help them survive. These characteristics are passed on to the next generation in the form of genes (Molson, 2001).
Sexual reproduction is a very important concept. Here an individual produces offspring and these offspring then grow into adults. By the process, two parental organisms combine to produce offspring. Among the organisms like humans and flowers, only some genes can be expressed in both parents and are therefore passed to the offspring. This means that the offspring gets many desirable genes from the two parents (Johannes, 2001).
Genetics drift is an important evolutionary concept. Here it is noted that even though mutations are a rare occurrence, they cause significant changes in the genetic traits and hence results in evolution. This is because most of the organisms do not give rise to progeny and hence only a few leave the species as they are unable to produce offspring or as they are unable to change in order to give rise to progeny that are productive (Nussey, 2001).
All these factors contribute to evolution. Understanding the role of the factors in evolution is essential for the survival of the species. The factors play a major role and are very important for evolution.",388,4,2136

Describe two different characteristics that make recovery objectives for recovering IT services on a temporary IT service management solution different from recovery objectives for recovering IT services on a new IT service management solution.
Discuss how the ITIL guidance differs between temporary, sustained, and permanent IT service management solutions.
In this survey, respondents tell us the top two drives for achieving optimal service performance: how critical the service is and how negatively it would be impacted if the service or function was unavailable. There are, of course, other reasons beyond these two that drive organizations to optimize services; lack of visibility is an example. What percentage of respondents think a lack of visibility is the top reason for looking to optimize services?
Here's a nice quote: “When people think about change, they think about what's going to be hard, or what they think they're going to have to do.” That's from author and speaker Elisabeth Aries. How many of the survey respondents said their efforts to achieve ITSM optimization were inspired by a desire to do what was hard?
Use this process to determine when to start the optimization process for an IT service and when to prioritize areas of optimization:
What does ITIL call the operations management plan?

What does the example show? The team(s) deploying the service can develop a migration plan that’s tied to the ITIL design and development process. In other words, they can do development and deployment in an efficient, standardized, and repeatable manner. Which step is this step?
For new IT services, an organization should use the ITIL strategy lifecycle framework to define how the service and its sub-services fit within the organization’s overall strategic direction. To do so, the organization should consider:

Common misconceptions about education budget cuts in Arizona#6932745
- By: Jeff Zink
- Published: Jan 3, 2016
Misconception 1: the Great Recession caused the largest school budget cuts in the history of Arizona
The numbers bear this out and they are well-documented and widely disseminated. The University of Arizona’s Economic and Business Research Center concluded that state K-12 funding levels today are lower, in terms of spending per pupil, than they were before the Great Recession. To be fair, public K-12 budgets in Arizona were under-funded prior to 2008. We were ranked 48th in the nation in K-12 per-pupil spending. The largest cuts came between 2008-2012. A collapse in the housing market and the resulting great recession did not help matters.
After plummeting to a low of 43rd in the nation in K-12 per-pupil spending in 2012, Arizona has recently returned to roughly where it was in 2003. This is above 43rd and back up to a respectable spot among U.S. states in education spending. What happened to these funds in the interim is important to understand for policymakers seeking to achieve and maintain top 10 education rankings for Arizona in the future. Rather than pursuing more money for education, the state spent a good portion of the windfall on an undoable Taxpayer Protection Act and then a deadly 2012 proposition — Proposition 204 — that put all those dollars into maintaining an unsustainable top 10 education system instead of using them as the central funding source for public K-12. The historic cuts of 2008 are best thought of as a plan for cutting way back, something to put the state on a sound footing for the future and, at the time, necessary as the $1.1 billion revenue windfall turned into a $1.3 billion revenue shortfall and property taxes were hobbled.
The additional $200 million in per-pupil funding provided by the legislature in 2015 only scratched the surface of the real gaps that exist in K-12 education budgets because those dollars were largely used for day-to-day operations as opposed to creating new programs. Those dollars are a one-time band aid that cannot be applied to the repair of a totally destroyed",455,4,2186

1. Research: Before you start gardening, take some time to learn about the plants you wish to grow and the local climate and soil conditions. Consider the space you have available, the type of plants you want to cultivate, and how much time and effort you are willing to invest in the process.

2. Get the right tools: A good quality gardening trowel, spade, watering can, and gloves can make all the difference in your success. Invest in quality tools that are durable and comfortable to use.

3. Plan your garden: Plan the layout of your garden before you start planting. Consider the sunlight, wind, and rainfall patterns of your location and choose plants that will thrive in those conditions. Also, consider any local zoning or building codes that may affect your garden.

4. Start with easy-to-grow plants: Start with easy-to-grow plants such as tomatoes, lettuce, and radishes. They don't require a lot of maintenance and are great for beginners.

5. Water regularly: Make sure to water your plants regularly, especially during dry spells. Different plants have different watering needs, so make sure to research the specific needs of each plant.

6. Fertilize regularly: Give your plants the nutrients they need to grow by fertilizing them regularly. Use a balanced fertilizer and follow the instructions on the packaging.

7. Prune and deadhead: Prune your plants to remove dead or diseased leaves, and deadhead flowers to encourage new growth.

8. Protect your plants: Protect your plants from pests and diseases by using natural remedies such as insecticidal soap or neem oil, or by introducing companion plants that repel pests.

9. Enjoy your garden: Finally, enjoy your garden! Plant what you love, and get outside to enjoy the benefits of gardening, such as fresh produce, beautiful flowers, and a sense of accomplishment.

My mother-in-law and I think that the tiny balls might be coming from the nearby dam pond where Canadian geese are often seen. When the geese are hanging out near the dam, hundreds of small balls of various size, called «eggs», make their way onto the lawn.
The bugs that swarm over this debris are myriapods. They look like little white bugs with long feelers, but they are not white by any means. This is because they are covered in a layer of wax so that when the wind blows, they will move with less air resistance.

""A Jew is a person of great freedom; free to wear green and yellow, red and blue, and violet on his clothes... Freedom of clothes, is the beginning of national pride, the foundation of national dignity and the assurance of national pride. "" (Simon Roth, Jew magazine, 1907).
Whether a costume has no voice and speaks more eloquent than words, they are one of the most enduring facts about our everyday lives in the field of fashion and clothing. According to ancient Jewish tradition, a person's freedom of clothing can indicate their commitment to Jewish customs, ultimately celebrating ""the attainment of the highest level of faith and love of God"".
Each character has its own style. And it is not surprising that Jews, whose history dates back to ancient times, are not ready to compromise their freedom of clothing and to abandon the identity of their culture and religion. From colourful traditional Yiddish clothing for women and men, to glittering traditional Jewish female clothing such as a short skirt, along with a decorative vest, and a short or short yet thick woolen suit, Jews love getting dressed and making an incredible show of style.
While practicing creativity and experiments with fashion, we live by ancient rules that have already become part of our society today.
According to several observations and even approximations, it has been established that the ability to combine different colours in one outfit may be a remarkable sign of culture and a clear indication of good taste.
Best examples of Jewish outfits, along with a tremendous involvement and dedication to cultural and religious values, can be seen in New York, where you can observe the combination of classic suits and traditional patterns, including a wide range of headgear, and braided hair.
Five basic norms of Jewish clothing (contemporary interpretations of fashion):
1. Traditional male clothes
The famous Jewish Geniuses and Writers who established the great achievements, rule in the scientific world with men's plaid striped shirts, light blue gobs (denim of sparsely even trousers), classic European black leather shoes and elegant belts made of different materials (metal, steel, other items).
2. Tradition and innovation in women's clothing
A short skirt women, traditionally tiffany style greenish shades, length of just below the knee, combined with a well-done vest, coat, suit, short or short wool sweater on top or on the legs.

These two aspects create the foundation of understanding cultural foodways, and a focus on how one’s present knowledge or cultural heritage is likely shaped by both their immediate surroundings as well as their past.
According to Civil Action teacher Cherri Goode, our understanding of both who we are and how we relate to the world around us “is rooted in the habits of our past.” This ability to understand one’s cultural foodways allows people to make culinary decisions centered around one’s ability to store food, detect freshness and ensure food quality, and have the means to access or create it. In her interactive presentation, Goode guides students to understand foodways in an American context while also incorporating how taste intersects with culture in a historical context. Moreover, it is the way one distinguishes their food choices and habits from that of their ancestral origin that speaks to the cultural significance of food. This is what many of Goode’s students have termed the “food traditions” and “cultural cuisine” of themselves.
There is a growing push in popular media to reclaim and celebrate our cultural foodways. While this idea of culinary “authenticity” may be largely up for interpretation, it is important to note that foodways are organic and aren’t necessarily static nor are they orphans of cultural appropriation. This points to the complexity and importance of appreciating the different food traditions of others and how these traditions have both been shaped by their culture but also by the foodways of others. For example, it has been noted that the widely-loved menu items from New York’s French restaurant Marea are actually the result of “a combination of approaches.” Without dipping into stereotypical white chef and Italian city tropes, Marea is able to showcase its singular Italian roots in a manner that feels authentic to its local New York community but is also able to appeal to a broader market by showcasing Italian cuisines beyond just what people have come to expect. Moreover, the smaller of these companies that have similar approaches are able to draw upon their ownership and community, creating a representation of Italian food that is wholly and purely their own.
These dinner menus are, in turn, informed by the changing of how foodways have altered in America over the last few decades. Whether the changes stem from shifts in population demographics or global economic climates, foodways continue to be modified by both the changing of cultural attitudes and changing of the understanding of what constitutes a healthy diet. With this in mind,",522,4,2731

Once upon a time, in the land of earth, there was a mighty force known as the Earth Mother. She was the creator of all that was, and all that was not.

One day, as the Earth Mother was relaxing in her home, she noticed something strange. The sky had been clouded over for days, and the ground was feeling much heavier. She knew that something was wrong.

As she ventured out to see what was happening, she discovered a group of giants who were digging up the land. They had been hired to build a grand structure, and they were using the Earth's energy to do so.

The Earth Mother knew that this was wrong. She called upon her trusted companion, the Moon, to help. Together, they confronted the giants and demanded that they stop using the Earth's energy.

But the giants would not listen. They continued to dig and work, until the Earth Mother's patience ran out. She called upon the Earth's power and created a great earthquake that shook the giants off their feet.

The Earth Mother then showed the giants the importance of the Earth's resources and the consequences of using them without regard for the Earth's wellbeing. She explained that the Earth was not just a place to build structures, but a home for all life.

From that day on, the giants respected the Earth Mother and her wisdom. They began to use the Earth's energy in a more responsible way, and the land was able to heal itself from the damage done by the giants.

And so, the Earth Mother's legend was passed down through generations, a reminder that we must always respect the Earth and all its wonders.

How did the Earth Mother's legends shape ancient cultures?

The Earth Mother's legends played a significant role in shaping ancient cultures. These stories were often passed down orally from one generation to the next and were considered sacred. They served as a reminder of the importance of respecting the Earth and living in harmony with nature.

In many cultures, the Earth Mother was seen as the goddess of the land and was revered as a powerful force. She was believed to have the ability to control the Earth's elements and to protect her people from harm. Her stories were often used to teach children about the importance of taking care of the Earth and the consequences of not doing so.

In some cultures, the Earth Mother was seen as a symbol of fertility and abundance. Her stories were used to teach people about the importance of planting and harvesting crops, and about the cycles of life and death.

Due to economic constraints, a large portion of energy will be produced by fossil fuels during the next decades. However, as energy production mechanisms provide heat and pollutant emissions, climate change represents an important threat to modern society and ultimately to the wellbeing of future generations. This fact implies a research of cost-effective mechanisms in order to either reduce the impact of energy production (through the design of systems that exploit the energy already produced in the most efficient ways) or to reduce our dependence on carbon-based fuels (through new technologies).
Residues and wastes (e.g., plastics), exhaust gases, light bulbs, and very small particles (e.g., cigarette smoke) represent important sources of emissions into the atmosphere and their impact on the quality of the environment and people's health have been widely recognized during the last few years. An innovative group of researchers in the area of natural resources protection (e.g., environmental engineering, applied physics, chemical engineering, environmental health and safety management) are seeking candidates interested in the study of the impact of emissions in the atmospheric environment, in particular the concentration levels of fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM) and their chemical constituents in indoor and outdoor environments.
1.	Consumption of energy is amongst the main sectors which produces greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), an important factor driving the current climate change trend. As the largest user of fossil fuels in Brazil, residential and commercial sectors comprise one of the main sectors still driving fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions in Brazil. As one solution to mitigate GHG emissions, infrastructure such as Smart Grids could be deployed and managed to improve energy efficiency in buildings, especially in heating and cooling processes, by optimizing the coordination among buildings and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. This proposal's main objective is to study the global impact of Smart Grids technologies on the energy demand, the quality of indoor air and the exposure of building inhabitants to particulate matter.

The snow cover in Antarctica is drastically changing over the last decades with important implications for the dynamics of ice sheets, the redistribution of heat in the atmosphere, and thus the global climate. Over the last decades, and still today, an intensive development of an infrastructure for oil exploration is taking place in Antarctica.

446,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", including key discoveries and breakthroughs in the field. Genetics is the study of genes, heredity, and genetic variation in living organisms. The history of genetics can be traced back to ancient times, but the field of genetics as we know it today emerged in the 19th century.

The first significant breakthrough in genetics was Gregor Mendel's discovery of the laws of inheritance in pea plants in the mid-19th century. He formulated the theory of ""genetic unit"" or ""factor,"" and the laws of inheritance that have since become known as Mendelian inheritance, which is the basis of modern genetics. This discovery helped to explain some of the traits that are inherited from parents to their offspring, such as eye color, height, and other physical characteristics.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the field of genetics was revolutionized by the discovery of chromosomes. In 1909, Edmund Wilson, a Scottish embryologist, discovered that the chromosomes in chromosomes of living organisms carry genes. This discovery led to the study of the structure and function of genes, which eventually led to the identification of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

In the mid-20th century, scientists made important advances in understanding the structure and function of DNA. In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered the DNA double helix structure, which helped to explain how genetic information is passed from generation to generation. In the 1970s, further research by Barbara McClintock and others led to the discovery of epigenetics, which refers to the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence.

In recent years, the study of genetics has expanded to include the use of gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9. These techniques have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic diseases by allowing scientists to edit the genes that cause these diseases. The field of genetics has also contributed to our understanding of evolution and biological diversity, and has had a significant impact on fields such as agriculture and biotechnology. Overall, the study of genetics has been a key factor in the advancement of human knowledge about ourselves and our world.

Cool, thanks for explaining the history of genetics! Can you provide more information on the ethical implications of gene editing? Certainly!

Phaedrus claimed that without poetry, society could not flourish. However, our approach to writing and speaking through literature has changed dramatically over time, and not for the better. For this reason, I am starting a plan to help correct for our current cultural emphasis on confusingly babbled writing, in whatever genre. This is a part-time plan, not one requiring constant attention, but thought that I can contribute, in smaller pieces, to.
I have a couple of tasks to accomplish in the coming weeks to help lay the foundation for success. I need to look into the development of a tool for using a serial plot structure in writing fiction, and one to read the prosody in prose. Both of these could be templates for better story-telling, and for poetry as well, but I'll only have them in mind as I develop the stories. With enough success, I may be able to pull off a condensed version for a person with no writing experience to use. This may be necessary to achieve my real target, a program that can teach high school-age students the skill of story-telling, without even very much formal instruction.
Another task I will be working on is developing a program to read the prosody of prose, which may also be used in music (I'm not sure that prose is the best medium for reading the meaning of music). This would also be a more technical or ""requirement,"" per se, for the prosody-reading program, but may need to be a later part of the development, because what needs to be taught can be fairly different for each genre, and equally important.
This blog will serve as my lab notebook and continuing reference for the development of the reader and the instruction tool, as well as ideas for use of text. When I've got something that is my primary focus, I may start a separate blog specifically for fiction writing.
I thought I might join a writing group or a critique circle, and I'm considering setting up a series of meetups, but really, I'm thinking that I can still share the development of these tools for a more online approach. In fact, the whole premise of this web site is to relate these tools to modern web-based interactions, and this is an online exchange that I've been wanting for a long time.

One of the many ways to approach the question would be to ask how big the bundle is that people know. If we could imagine everyone remembering that basic class of which they took their senior year of high school, I think that would be a bit of a chunk.
When I started into baking, I knew I was definitely in over my head. Something that initially was supposed to be an interest and possibly a change of vocation became something much more with a greater than average commitment. That is how it is for many people.
I found that I quite enjoyed cooking and baking as a hobby, and those two went together nicely. I love to cook and bake. Then, there are other things I enjoy in a certain degree as well. For me, these include wine tasting, modeling (i.e. dressing) recipes with models, and photography of recipes or just of food. What can I say? I really love food.
The more time I spent pursuing this hobbiy, the more I found that I like to seek and try new things. I love to experiment, although there are some things in my cooking and baking that have certainly gone a bit beyond that. I also found that I like to write and to read. I thought that this would be nice for a blog and wrote so.
Thus, the starter, my basic bundle of knowledge. While there are undoubtedly many things I do not know, that is not what is important. The starting point that would inspire this bundle is entirely different from the long list of forgotten skills for which people may ask for a refresher.
I have, in this site, certain archetypes of content I consider great for everyone to know and to learn more about. A good basic starter would be a sort of national and international recipe book with sections dedicated to appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The idea being that it would be easy to start learning how to use a cookbook, a knife, some tools, and to teach yourself in one fell swoop.
Then, there would be sections on wines, beer, and spirits to learn what they are and to pair them well with recipes. We must learn also to love quality foods and not mass-produced items that, with a few exceptions, most people think of as food.

452,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," cannot be understated. Through advancements in medical technology, conditions that were once fatal are now treatable or even manageable with lifestyle modifications. From the invention of penicillin to disease diagnosis, the work of research scientists has increased the quality of life for millions of people.
However, being a medical researcher has its drawbacks. While work in the lab can be challenging, it can also be dangerous. There are instances where exposure to harmful elements can lead to certain illnesses and even death. Even worse, victims of medical researcher negligence cannot sue for compensation due to sovereign immunity.
The Birth of Medical Research
The early history of medical research involves the discipline of medicine and a need for organ donors. In the early 1800s, there was a limited amount of organ donors who were not likely to recover from the transplants they received. It is here that the need for better options arose. After the discovery of blood transfusions, it was revealed that donors and recipients shared antibodies, making transplants viable for a period of time. It would be another 100 years before transplantation would be performed regularly with the availability of compatible donors.
Medical Researcher Negligence
Despite the promising nature of transplants, many individuals would experience complications and die as a result of the procedure. Improper precautions by the medical researcher were to blame. In some instances, doctors used unsterilized needles, ignored their x-rays, and falsified their test results. These are just some of the many causes of medical researcher negligence.
Benefits of Medical Research Negligence Suits
It would be impossible to start any transplant program without additional funding. Lawsuit proceeds could be used to fund and create a post-transplant recovery center. New types of medical research would not see the light of day without funding and, in some instances, private medical researchers know what works and what doesn’t. Much of what we know today about the human body would not have been possible without the research and development of the medical community.
Who Can Sue for Medical Researcher Negligence?
Individuals who have received transplants can sue medical researchers who caused the complications and the additional medical bills incurred due to it. Additionally, research institutions can sue for damages and treatment.
Injured victims cannot seek compensation from government programs due to sovereign immunity. However, several states have rules that exclude medical researcher negligence from sovereign immunity. Hawaii is one of them. Individuals who believe they have a valid claim may want to consider contacting an attorney.

454,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Neuroscience can provide us with incredible insights into how the brain works, and these insights have several potential benefits.

One of the primary benefits of neuroscience is that it can help us understand and treat a wide range of mental health disorders. Neuroscience research has led to the development of medications and other therapies that have improved the lives of millions of people suffering from conditions such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.

Another potential benefit of neuroscience is that it can help us develop new technologies that can improve our quality of life. For example, advances in neural engineering and brain-computer interfaces have the potential to help people with paralysis or other physical disabilities.

Neuroscience can also help us better understand how our brains process and respond to the world around us. This knowledge can help us develop new insights into everything from how we learn and remember information to how we make decisions and perceive emotions.

Overall, neuroscience has the potential to provide us with a deeper understanding of the brain and its functions, as well as to help us develop new technologies and therapies that can improve our lives and the lives of others.

Are there any potential downsides or risks associated with neuroscience research? While there are many potential benefits to neuroscience research, there are also some potential downsides and risks associated with this field.

One potential risk of neuroscience research is that it may raise ethical concerns. For example, research involving human subjects may raise issues related to informed consent, privacy, and autonomy. Additionally, the use of animals in neuroscience research has been criticized for causing undue suffering and ethical concerns.

Another potential risk of neuroscience research is that it may reveal information that could be used to harm individuals or society as a whole. For example, research into the brain mechanisms underlying addiction could lead to the development of new, more effective addiction treatments, but it could also be used to develop treatments that exploit people's addictions for financial gain.

Finally, there is also the risk that the field of neuroscience may overpromise and underdeliver. While there are many exciting discoveries being made in this field, it can be difficult to predict the impact of these discoveries on society as a whole, and it is important to remain cautious when making claims about the potential applications of neuroscience research.

Overall, while there are certainly risks associated with neuroscience research, it is important to balance these risks against the potential benefits. As with any scientific field, it is important to proceed with caution and to carefully consider the potential implications of any new research before it is brought into the public domain.

462,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is not as simple as people once assumed. One way to think about this is to remember how, when learning about derivatives in a finance course, one is taught the replicating portfolio strategy to determine fair prices for financial instruments. Namely, if there is some contingent claim in the world, then a replicating portfolio consisting of say, the cheapest vanilla bond (corresponding to a zero coupon bond) and options on the underlying security, will generate a zero cost investment vehicle that is perfectly hedged against changes in the underlying, and for whom valuation is trivially easy. The only difference being that we price the contingent claim based on what the replicating portfolio costs and discount it at the riskless rate. Put another way, the derivative goes through three stages; first we determine the replicating portfolio, second we derive the cost of this portfolio, third we discount this cost back to determine value.

In an economy where the price level in nominal terms is much higher than the real price level, then we can value the contingent claim in the economy in terms of the current price level, without thinking about the factors in the economy that impact the price level, such as inflation, whether the economy is currently in a recession, etc. The replicating portfolio will then consist of the closest thing we can buy today to represent the value of the contingent claim, which is a basket of goods and services that reflect our best guess as to how a representative agent would spend an average day. By discounting the cost of this portfolio back to today, we can then derive the cost of the contingent claim.

In the mathematical formalism, this process is carried out by discounting the cost back to a present day valuation, but what it means in practice is that the economy needs a certain amount of consumption of goods and services as calculated by its agents, in order for the economy to have the right cost structure. By using the replicating portfolio strategy, we can value the contingent claim while taking into account the value of consumption.

When the price level is about equal to the value of consumption, then it’s not so easy to separate out which components of the economy represent consumption and which represent the factors that affect the price level. Therefore, the analysts of the economy need to carry out the three stage derivation, instead of using the replicating portfolio strategy.

Further complicating things, is the fact that inflation can vary quite a bit depending on what the economy is in. In the middle of a recession, we do not know how many people are out of work and in need of",514,4,2664

Taking this into consideration you get to make a choice between a low-fat recipe or one with more fattening ingredients. The health conscious part of you always wants to include only healthy ingredients in your diet.
If you desire a low-fat burger recipe, then here is your chance to do exactly that by following a simple recipe guide.
First thing you need to do when preparing a low-fat burger recipe is to measure the right ingredients. Take about 1 pound of lean beef or ground turkey and mix together with 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. After you have mixed the ingredients together, shape them into small oval-shaped patties. Please remember to shape them to the right size, because this will determine how the taste of your burger will turn out. After shaping the patties, store them in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. After, prepare the grill or broiler. You can use about 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil as a spray to keep the patties from sticking to the griddle. Close the door of the oven for about 15 minutes. Take out the burgers and give them a turn and then leave them there for the remaining 15 minutes. Brush the grill with extra virgin olive oil to avoid them from sticking when cooking. Take out the burgers and put them on the serving plate. Lightly season with salt and pepper.
Take about 1 egg white and whip it till it forms a foam. Add 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and 3 tablespoons of finely chopped onion. Add 1 teaspoon of garlic salt to the mixture and mix it all together and then flatten it. Place 3 inches above the grill. Cook for 5 minutes or until you notice a golden brown crust on it and lightly season with salt and pepper.
You can cook beef burgers, ground turkey and of course chicken burgers. The fat content does not change however it all depends on the quantity of fat you use. With this recipe guide you can have your very own low fat burger recipe.

Spring 2013
This quarter, my research mentor was Kari Larson, Associate Professor of Sociology. My research is my contribution to a larger research effort at the University of Minnesota where, beginning in the 1960s, Professor Walter Friendly undertook an evaluation of physical education courses at two University of Minnesota campuses: one for black students, and one for white students. For his research, Professor Friendly measured teacher scores, class observations, and student surveys to better understand why students were interested in and attended PE classes. He looked at student opinion and he looked at class observations. He hoped to see a difference in how black students and white students were treated in PE classes. He believed that physical education should be more race-neutral. Instead, what he found was somewhat shocking. He found that black students were systematically mistreated in PE class. Black students felt judged more harshly. Black students also felt that physical education classes were less challenging for them than for white students.
Kari invited me to join the exploration of this topic and offered me the opportunity to help piece together the results of some of Professor Friendly’s work and to better understand the data currently available to researchers in the university archives. I worked as a student researcher during my first year at Macalester and with two research assistants during my second year.
Most of my time this quarter was spent preparing for the public seminar in May, when we offered the interpretation of this work to a broader audience. After my mentors and I met with Professor Friendly in December, we spent several months finding and fixing data errors. Professor Friendly developed part of the data, so it was up to me to fix it.
We taught a class on our research to graduate students this quarter at the University of Minnesota, and we are using the course to illustrate some of the challenges that come from working with the archival collections of the university. Today we had our last class, and we have learned a lot together in the past six weeks. We are learning about where data comes from and how data is made.

Asking why business matters is the same as asking what is the main purpose for living. Because when an individual, business or government stop doing the business, they cease to exist and then no one can consume their services. Let me explain it further;
Everybody needs a product or service. And to obtain that product or service, they need to purchase it from a manufacturer, retailer, supplier or from a service provider. No matter what you want, you won’t get it unless someone is there to provide it.
So what is the difference between a retailer and a manufacturer?
Retailer is just a person who is selling a product. For example, a person who has a pet shop where she sells pet food and veterinary medicines to everyone around. He is like a direct matchmaker who provides a facility to his consumers to get a pet medicine but no one is making the medicines. He is just an intermediate.
But manufacturing is not like that. It is like providing all the services, materials, equipments, technology, quality check, maintenance of the product from the beginning to the end, that is directly accountable for the quality and quantity of the product. From its value, support, to all services to its final customer who purchases the product or service.
The major difference between retailer and manufacturer is that a retailer is a person who brings goods to the final customer but a manufacturer is a person who brings products to the market by taking an entire supply chain responsibility of producing them. A manufacturer keeps the consumers in the loop and keeps informing the consumers the type, quality, material, price, quantity, plans, etc. of the product in order to meet their needs and wants.
But, do you think the product is only available because the person who brought it is making it? Then, why is the businessman and businesswoman even required in any organization?
Buisness is called “business” because it is worth doing. There are many people who know about the benefits of entrepreneurship and a business that does not have entrepreneur is not considered a business. So without a businessman or a woman, where will the activities and the benefits of the business.
But these people know who a businessman is. A business exists because of the entrepreneurs, salespersons, producers, engineers, and many other individuals who are doing their jobs and responsible for the improvement of their organization and earning money as well.
The profit earned by any organization is not possible without the stakeholders of the organization. They are employees, colleagues, workers, and even managers. All the stakeholders are important for any business operation.",513,4,2668
468,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,": Is there any requirement to add B12 to multivitamins for vegetarians and vegans?
Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products and can be added to eggs, meat, dairy products and veggie alternatives.
Since vegetarians and vegans are unlikely to get enough vitamin B12 from their regular diets, it's important to consider supplementing. This is because insufficient B12 can lead to the blood supply to the nerves being impaired, which can affect the eyes, the feet, muscles, the heart and the brain. A normal and balanced diet shouldn't be combined with vitamin B12, as this adds yet more vitamins to the body which can cause an overdose.
Vegetarians can ensure they're getting adequate levels of vitamin B12 from the proteins, eggs, dairy, nuts and seeds they eat. Vegans, however, must be vigilant about their B12 consumption due to their lack of animal products in the diet.
How can you get vitamin B12?
Two of the main food sources of vitamin B12, both of which vegans could look to add to the diet, are dairy and eggs. However, only vegetarians will find animal sources of vitamin B12 readily available within the diet.
There are many vegan sources of vitamin B12, such as almonds, spinach, soy milk, spinach and watercress, avocado, soy products, mushrooms and dairy alternatives. However, while good sources of B12, adding these to your diet may not provide enough nutrients in an optimal amount to suit a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle.
Why is vitamin B12 important for vegetarians and vegans?
A deficiency in vitamin B12 can be fatal in the long-term, as a lack of this nutrient can affect many of the body's key systems. The best way to ensure you're not deficient is to ensure you have a diet full of nutritious, daily meals which are heavy on fruit and vegetables.
Can I get vitamin B12 from a multivitamin?
Yes, B12 is one of the key nutrients to supplement into the diet through a good multivitamin. However, you should pay careful attention to the quantity and dosage of B12 you are receiving.
The NHS recommends a dosage of 1.5 mcg of B12 per day, which can be found in as little as 0.003mg of B12 in a multivitamin. If you're getting your levels too high from your vitamin, your",511,4,2198

# Ciphers with One or More Permutations

This is Part 2 of a 2 part series. Part 1 is here.

In the previous section, we saw that a one-permutation cipher requires for all parties to exchange a single “shared” permutation; and that two-permutation ciphers may be used in a partially shared manner. In this section, we will show that permutations can be used in a secure and “frictionless” way.

It is enough to consider only binary permutations, since the other types of permutations ($n>2$) are simply a binary permutation for each individual input/output. We will not bother with binary fields that have a non-power of two length since these can easily be converted to the conventional form for $\operatorname{GF}(2)$; e.g., with a non-power of two length, $\operatorname{GF}(2)[X]/\langle X^{n-1}\rangle$ can be considered as $\operatorname{GF}(2)[X]/\langle X^{8}\rangle$. Since this inconvenience would not be of interest to us, we will not explore the use of binary fields with non-power of two lengths. In general, a binary permutation will be represented as $$\pi\colon x \mapsto x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1} \mapsto x_1, \ldots, x_n,$$ where $\{x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}\}$ are the inputs and $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ are the outputs.

There are a number of reasons why permutations can have many practical uses: not only is permutation the building block of all linear cryptosystems, but they are very convenient for block ciphers and multi-key ciphers. Permutation provides a natural and convenient way to share a secret key with multiple parties (see the previous section). Furthermore, in the context of symmetric cryptography, we do not need to work with bits directly. Instead, we convert the bit-based objects into polynomial ring elements and work in a larger field; in particular, we consider all polynomials over a binary field. Consider, for example, an encryption scheme that requires a permutation to be shared amongst a collection of $n$ parties. In this scheme, each party will be given a set of $n$ “keys” $K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_n$. When any party $P",581,4,2065

This is due to the advent of quantum computing, which promises to revolutionize computing as we know it. In this blog post, we’ll take a closer look at how quantum computing is changing the world and why we should pay more attention to it.
Quantum Computing: A New Kind of Computer
Quantum computing is a new kind of computer. Unlike traditional computers, which use bits to process information, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits). Qubits are more complicated than bits because they can exist in more than one state at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform more complex calculations in a shorter amount of time. For example, a quantum computer could factor large numbers faster than any classical computer ever could.
The Impact of Quantum Computing
Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize many areas of modern society. For example, it could be used to solve complex problems in fields such as medicine, finance, and national security. It could also be used to create more secure encryption systems, which is becoming increasingly important in the age of cyber threats.
Why Quantum Computing Matters
Quantum computing is important because it represents a major shift in the way we think about computation. It is a fundamentally new type of computer, one that operates on the basis of quantum mechanics. Quantum computing has already begun to change the world, and it will continue to do so for many years to come.",300,4,1586

Bill Seely, an associate professor in Kinesiology and Health Studies, will be a featured guest speaker at the conference - an ecological technology congress - on Friday, June 24 and Saturday, June 25 at Niagara College, Welland Campus.
Seely will share results from two of his projects.
They are a 17-month collaborative study with digital learning media production students from Redeemer University College on more effective methods for teaching students how to live in a digital society, and a White Deer Species project, which was conducted in the Killingworth area in Grey County in southern Ontario. Participants included 40 Grade 9 students.
Seely said the first study “gives me a unique perspective on teaching, on engaging students in a topic, on finding an appropriate balance between material content and experiential and reflective processes as a way to teach students how to live in a digital age,” he said.
The project grew from a unique relationship between Seely and more than 100 students in undergraduate high school Environmental Science classes at Grimsby Collegiate Institute in Ontario.
Seely has taught environmental science for more than 12 years. Most of his high school students came from a Mennonite background, he said. This unique cultural background allows them to have deep spiritual reverence for all forms of life, including wildlife.
“This has influenced their living in a digital society from a different worldview,” he said.

By using historical data to detect patterns, classification and forecasting models are created for practical applications. Data mining and statistical analysis are used to extract information and to find common relations and patterns.

Programming-related modules include classification algorithms, clustering methods and association rule learning. Data preprocessing and augmentation as well as feature and data selection modules are also included in these programs. Utility systems are also incorporated, such as computer vision systems that integrate data from numerous sources and OpenCV algorithms that allow for parsing of objects within images.

Machine learning enables intelligent assistants such as Google voice search, Amazon Echo, and Apple Siri. It can also help with medical diagnoses and disease detection, such as facial recognition in X-Ray or MRI scans.

Natural language processing (NLP) is important in many aspects of computer programming, as well as in the interpretation of natural language by computers. These processes allow machines to extract information from text data, understand relationships between sentences and extract features of a sentence. Machine learning helps identify the entities of a sentence and map them to real world entities such as entities, entities, and locations. It can identify information in a sentence and classify text based on sentiment or tone. It can be used to create chatbots or virtual assistants, or as a part of language translation systems, or even in making speech recognition more efficient.

MapReduce, a programming model invented by Google for distributed file processing, is highly utilized in big data analysis and is used to store and process large datasets quickly. Some of the fundamental concepts behind MapReduce include map and reduce functions and how to ensure that all nodes in a distributed computation complete all jobs in parallel. The MapReduce programming model is suited for Machine learning algorithms as it is conducive to parallelism and ease of use for executing code on a variety of nodes.

Data Visualization can include linear plotting, scatter plots, histograms, heat maps, and more.

476,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and agriculture need to be communicated to the agricultural community and the general public by a greater focus on forecasting and improved access to information. This is the view of Steph Brown, a meteorologist with the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma who was speaking during her talk – Advancing Early-Warning Systems for Southeastern US Agriculture – at the world's largest crop science conference, the International Crop Science Society (ICSCS), in Brisbane, Australia.
“Farmers already face significant uncertainty with respect to the price and availability of their inputs, like seed and fertilizer,” she says. This uncertainty combined with poor access to quality weather information means that farmers often do not invest in practices that can help improve agricultural production and mitigate risk.
The challenge of communicating weather and climate to the agricultural community is made more difficult by a lack of awareness by the agricultural community that weather information exists in a form that could be used to make decisions. Weather information available to farmers through their local Extension office or the local telecommunication company has no value without a commodity market in which to base those decisions.
“Without this direction, farmers cannot be expected to adopt strategies which can help to improve production on their farms, particularly for the more vulnerable or small-scale farmers,” says Brown.
She explains that there are two ways in which weather information can be used to enhance the agri-environmental sector. Firstly, weather information can be used in forecasting and advising the extent of the agricultural implications of weather events. Secondly, weather information can be used to develop management options and/or mitigation strategies which directly effect agriculture.
“However, little is known as to how to effectively communicate weather information to farmers,” she says. “There is more interest in the benefits of agrometeorology than understanding the key barriers to uptake.
“During the last three decades, agriculture has evolved to be a complex and segmented market. This makes it extremely difficult to engage with farmers or farmers' organisations to provide the weather information that farmers require. There is little focus on education of farmers, and too few opportunities for extension services or agricultural scientists to reach farmers. The barriers for uptake are complex and interrelated.”
A lot of work is currently being undertaken by Brown’s institute to improve access to weather information for small-scale farmers in the vulnerable Southeastern United States. The aim of the research is to change the livelihoods of farmers to be more resilient to climate variability and change, which will help to protect the agricultural industry of the region and encourage farming that is more environmentally sustainable.

Increasing our knowledge and understanding of geological processes, especially those relating to large-scale changes in the Earth's crust over geological timescales, has contributed to our increasingly detailed understanding of the Earth and its history. For example, by 2010, scientists had found evidence for a significant increase in the temperature of the lower atmosphere over the last 30 years which may explain the global cooling that was observed during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This, along with further discoveries, have led to the realisation that global cooling is a natural feature of the Earth's history rather than one of its man-made environmental problems.
The discipline of Earth science is related to the study of geological time, which is defined by four different time scales.
Absolute dating measures the time between an event in the geological past and the present. It indicates the year or precise time scale in which it occurred, but it does not date the event. Chemical evidence for such an event may be associated with minerals present in sedimentary rock layers, for example in the ""dolomite chemical boundaries"" used by the Palaeontologists to establish the relative age of fossils found within the same layer of rock. This particular concept is based on two mineral species: dolomite, which occurs naturally in high temperatures in contact metamorphic rocks such as marble, and calcite which occurs naturally in lower temperatures and is found in metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks.
Stratigraphic dating is a technique used to establish the age of a geological layer, simply by measuring the physical characteristics of a layer and comparing its characteristics with those of other layers.
Relative dating determines the age of a geological sample relative to one or more other layers. If the order of events is established, the oldest event can be defined as occurring before or at the beginning of the period in question and the youngest as occurring at the end of the time-scale. There are several techniques that fall under the term relative dating. By combining information of the relative ages of rocks and fossils, it is also possible to determine which order events took place in the evolutionary process.
Archaeology is the study of the past. Archaeologists make use of both relative and absolute dating techniques in their work. Relative dating is dependent on the fact that things become older as time passes. Since the late nineteenth century, geologists and archaeologists have used certain methods to establish the relative ages of rocks, fossils, and the earth.

Today we understand that we can be and remain healthy throughout our lives and should have a better life experience at any age.
Medical science, sports medicine, psychology, and more continue to provide the support for healthy aging. Researchers also point to the importance of genetics, certain lifestyle patterns, food, and the correct supplementation as important factors. But regardless of where people are on their journey, they are all facing the same problem: their blood-brain barrier. Because of changes in physiology, this barrier decreases functionality at a rate of 40 percent per decade once a person reaches their mid-40’s.
The barrier prevents nutrients from entering the brain at a healthy rate. The result is an age-related decrease in mental performance and in the end, a reduced quality of life.
Bridging the Blood-Brain Barrier with Phosphatidylserine
This leaves health and fitness experts with a problem. The only known food to have the ability to repair, regenerate, and protect the blood-brain barrier is phosphatidylserine – a chemical compound made from fats. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the only substance that can increase the resilience of the blood-brain barrier allowing nutrients such as glucose, oxygen, amino acids and vitamins to flow freely into the brain, increasing its function at an accelerated rate.
Phosphatidylserine (PS) in supplementation form is easy to add to your diet. There is a specific, easy-to-follow formula that can help. The question is how do you find this ingredient and utilize it to its fullest potential?
Subtle Ingredients
Today, most supplements only contain small amounts of this magic substance. However, because of the large amount of potency required to do a good job, users must take high dosages every day, which can also present some side effects.
People with autoimmune disorders are always concerned about increased inflammatory processes from this supplement. Further, everyone should be aware of all the side effects and how to avoid them.
It’s only in recent years that we’ve gained an appreciation for the science and the effect that PS has on the brain. Because of it, we’ve learned that there are three good ways to protect this vital barrier and increase it’s function:
- Phospholipids can protect the barrier
- Probiotics can feed and improve the barrier
- The right amino acids",528,4,2553
480,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is straightforward, once the basic concepts are understood.
In Einstein's book ""Relativity"", he explains the meaning of the doppler effect in three pictures. He says they demonstrate clearly the cause of the doppler effect.
Is not the picture that the light has travelled further redshifted beyond our visibility outside our galaxy making it seem more stretched out that it is?
If we ""see"" redshifted light from the far side of a galaxy as if it is ahead of us, while ""seeing"" blueshifted light in front of us from our own galaxy, our mind is not fooled, it is us that is fooled?
Now we can prove for ourselves that Einstein didn't understand anything about light or space.
We can make a non redshifted beam of light span a large distance and in the same direction using optical LIDAR.
Using the Doppler effect, using different observers, we can detect a constant relative redshift using the same beam of light, that can't be confused with any other source.
To measure and demonstrate the redshift of distant stars, we can use a refractive prism to split the beam, then after scattering, we can recover the two parts of the beam, and remove the prism, and then use the same beam again to identify the same two parts as separated on this time, and find a constant redshift, which is constant for both parts, and constant for each part.
Now we know the derivation, concept and proof of an optical RIA, using a refractive prism that produces a non Doppler normal non redshifted light beam, that we can actually measure, we know for sure that our interpretation of the redshift is wrong, and is not how distant galaxies are approaching us or redshifting us, the cause of the redshift is NOT light distance dilation.
Since we can demonstrate the non redshifted light beam, and the redshift cause using same parts of the same beam, the three pictures Einstein published that explain the redshift, are simply false.
Stop the redshift koolaid, stop the age stretching, stop the large dimming of the universe, stop the night sky as dense as day, stop the young planet, start from first principles and use the optics.
Mathematically speaking there can't be a constant frequency redshift, using the Doppler formula, as speed is directly proportional to frequency, so any redshift must decrease the frequency when velocity increases.
The only way to have a constant frequency redshift, is to change it inversely proportional to velocity",531,4,2425

A fundamental problem of current molecular biology is a lack of knowledge of this auxiliary (non-genic) information. For instance, as few as ten mutations in one gene can cause infertility of the male mouse. One must recognize that all viable alleles in wild type mice have come about because of a combination of mutations affecting, in most cases, unrelated regions of the genome. Mutations affecting sequences known to be not essential for viability often occur in the background of other mutations, in other genes. Thus, a mutant mouse may be an unmapped case, in which the ""genetic factor"" responsible for the mutation is unknown and has not yet been identified. Confusion can also arise when it is not known what haplotype an unmapped mutant represents. I first encounter this confusion as I worked to characterize female sterility caused by a mutation named R o , in 1976. Although I was initially pleased to find that most female R o mice died soon after birth, later I learned that in some litters of R o mice the wild-type (or near wild-type) sisters are also dead, which is unprecedented in the mouse. In all the 25 years since I first described the mouse mutant R o , I have not, however, seen a fourth such mutant, in which three of four sisters are dead.

I am finding myself in a limbo.

I was successful in approaching state and wave function in a very traditional linear algebra way using eigenstates and eigenvectors and eigenvalues but I am more interested in a broader perspective. The typical Hamiltonian models cannot model a system of inelastic scattering because if some particle in one space lost its energy, and another one gained it, how would you account for it? Are there formalities needed for such a system? You need a more global view of what goes on to be sure that you have a consistent system and yes, each system in itself may not have a consistent answer unless it is somehow globally defined. How can one reconcile the system being consistent? My first idea is to have some reference particle moving along a well-defined trajectory. It could be a particle flying through the sky. Then it would be easy to understand how other particles react with this particle.

Can someone give me direction on how to approach quantum field theory and how to proceed with further study in a constructive way? What is an approximate approach to go through the very step-by-step approach? Please treat me like you have taught this subject to 12 year olds and not as an extremely advanced physicist (not insulting) or student (sarcasm intended).

Training can be very much tailored to meet the needs of a certain institution, service or patients and other stakeholders. From practical experience, training on certain health topics may achieve a higher buy-in of participants if they are provided with a ""hands-on"" experience. For this reason, and to provide more practical application of the theme of animal-assisted therapy, a second training session using a therapy dog was introduced for physicians, nurses, midwives and other members of the healthcare team. Included in this training session were skills on activities of daily living and on the water exercise topic that was covered previously in the training session with the playing dog.
One of the most important messages of the team that were involved in this training session is that healthcare is a team effort and a shared responsibility. This was highlighted during the session as the 'therapy dog' (i.e., the human member of the team) was consistently reminded about the skills and knowledge of the other members of the team (i.e., nurses, physician etc) throughout. Having a person with physical health challenges participate in the training session was also part of the training exercise as this provides healthcare professionals with the opportunity to practice transfer of skills, as well as to explore how they would support the client in a variety of situations.
In both training sessions, the response of the participants was positive and immediate changes in attitudes and understanding in regards to animal-assisted therapy were evident. Potential applications of this activity in the training of healthcare professionals includes changes in attitudes and understanding of health, change in practice, as well as changes in the context of health. This was true both in the training session when a therapy dog was not present, as well as in the full training session when the therapy dog was brought in.
One thing that was very much appreciated by the participants was the awareness building session that was offered by the instructor. She kept the participants engaged throughout the training session by sharing information in an entertaining way using analogies, humor, while also providing the participants with practical information that they can take away and start to implement immediately.

The history of medicine reveals the formation and development of various trends, conceptions, ideas, technologies, skills, and sciences aimed at studying the human body and human individual pathology.
Ethics is the necessary part of the history of medicine. Without it, progress will be possible. Ancient medical doctrines revealed the problem of prolonging life and its endless worship. They developed several proposals of immortality in animals. The development of the medical profession and medicine was accompanied by various progress with the research of the issues of the unity of consciousness and body. It became clear that the foundation of medicine was medical ethics.
Today, the problem of medical ethics has become more important in the context of increasing medical knowledge and improving the quality of medical diagnostics. This can lead to wrong medical practices, legal cases, conflicts of interest between physicians, patients, or the state. Ethical and legal aspects are closely linked in modern medicine. Changes in the ethics of the health system are one of the current trends in the discussion of contemporary medicine.
This is not the first essay that looks at the development of medical ethics and the history of medicine in general. However, today we want to talk about the ideology and principles of medical ethics and show a new perspective of understanding the concepts of medical ethics that may be of interest to scientists and doctors.
What Is Medical Ethics and Why It Is Important?
The first conceptual and theoretical solution of modern medical ethics was formulated by Andreanus Ortelius, an official anatomist of the University of Leuven in the sixteenth century. His main thesis about the educational process and ethical training of students in medicine was developed by Tobias Thomas and Christoph Cunicus (early XVII century).
Further developments in the field of medical ethics were carried out by Nicolas Andronikov (Early XVII century) and Jean Fernel (late XVII century). It is believed that Thomas Thomas and Andreas Loewentohl have made a significant contribution to the emergence of a subject called “medical ethics”. Both of them discussed the best ways for improving medical practice by including ethical aspects in their works.
Loewentohl, in a 1673 publication, developed a story about himself, in which he describes the condition that led to many difficulties: the active resistance of the patients and the poor condition of the physicians.

492,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," have renewed interest in the scientific issues of this era, most notably in the relationship between volcanic eruptions and past climatic changes. The primary interest in the study of glacial, or ice-covered, regions is the impact of active volcanism on the last three glaciations. The study of lava fields that formed during glaciation is a relatively new one in the geologic literature, though it is conceptually rather simple. Indications are that throughout much of the glaciated (glacial) sections of the glaciers, volcanic eruptions produced lava fields or dykes. There are examples of ice age eruptions in continental basins and on islands in and around the glacial zone. The 1956 eruption of Mount St. Helens was one example of an eruption triggering a small glacial Lake Missoula watershed flood.
Alfredo G. Pratolo, a geoscientist at the University of Nevada at Reno, working in a glacial field near Donner Lake in the eastern Sierra Nevada in California, found evidence of volcanism during the last glaciation. With his colleague George F. Dull, he excavated an outcrop of the strata and observed many specimens of scoria from laterally and upward-arching lava flows on the west and northeast sides of the glacier. Pratolo and Dull wrote an article published in the professional journal GSA Bulletin that described these findings. They also took samples and sponges for thermoluminescence dating and found that some of these fragments had remained in place in their original stratigraphic positions for up to 20,000 years. Dull and Pratolo date the eruption to roughly 17,750 years ago and their findings corroborate other research showing the volcanic eruption that triggered the catastrophic Lake Missoula Flood.[1]
The study of glacial volcanism has direct implications for archaeology and paleoenvironmental studies. The study of lichens, perhaps the most important natural indicators of environmental change and chronology, has been skewed by modern eruptions. There was a significant gap in the research about lichen chronology of the last glacial period. The discovery of a strand of millennial lichen in the ages 16,300 to 15,900 calibrated years before present (cal BP) in the midst of a collection of glacial lichen in a cave in central Norway led lichenologist Karen Isaksson to rethink previous chronologies based on lichen data",489,4,2352

The article we are discussing today is a very important piece that many people need to read about flat stomach exercises. It includes detailed information and step by step directions on how to properly engage muscles in order to lose belly fat.
Flat Stomach Exercises: Which Will It Be?
Many people believe that by eating certain foods and exercising certain muscles, they will lose belly fat and gain a flat stomach. When you first start working out, it is very important to go slow and give yourself time to recover. You do not want to overwork yourself or you may injure yourself. Many people think that they can improve their fat burning abilities by exercising or eating certain foods. However, the truth is that changing your eating habits and exercising can help your body get the most out of each meal you eat. Changing your diet and adding in exercises like Pilates and yoga will help reduce your body weight and improve your stomach muscles. However, it is important to make sure that you are eating the proper foods for your body and doing the exercises properly.
Now that we have addressed which flat stomach exercises will work for you, lets talk a little about the process of having a flat stomach. The first step is to start with your diet. You can choose to eat more often and decrease the calories you consume or you can eat fewer times a day but increase the calories you take in. Both methods can produce results, but the first option is likely to give you greater results. Once you have decided on your new way of eating, it is time to begin exercising.
There are many different ways to do this, but the most effective is to spend an hour or two doing cardio exercise. Cardio exercise will burn fat while building up your endurance and toning your body. If you are wondering how long it takes for the body to burn fat, it can take anywhere from three to six hours to do so. This is not the only advantage of doing cardio exercise. It can also provide an effective workout for your legs, arm, and other muscles. Most people think that doing cardio exercises will only work for fat burning, but it does have some benefits for other areas as well.
Another benefit of doing cardio exercises is that it can improve your cardiovascular health. This means that your heart is able to pump blood throughout your body more efficiently. It also increases your metabolism which helps burn more calories. By doing these two things together you should see an improvement in your weight loss process.

Can you add examples that challenge these misconceptions?

“I don’t like the way Dr. Exposition explains this material; his lectures don’t help me.”

Pretend you’re inside a gigantic bubble, looking out through the latex skin at the universe. The planet earth is only a small disc, so small that the microscopic portion of the bubble you can see is a complete image of the earth.

The bubble then materializes a camera, which scans the portion of the earth as a polarized hologram, where the hologram technology is hooked up to your brain and allows you to see the hologram. All you see are volcanoes and forests. You can’t tell whether the hologram is flat or tilted; all you see are these two-dimensional things, just as if you had a camera that could only photograph flat surfaces.

From this perspective, you can zoom in on the landmasses and see the incredibly intricate structures of the volcanoes and forests. Their shapes are so detailed that they resemble almost nothing anyone has ever seen before.

You can even travel around the earth, using the camera to photograph cities. You can even zoom in on a building, and then upon the building so minutely, that you see an individual brick, and observe its properties in fascinating detail.

Finally, you can also see people zooming around on cars. Of course, these people are of no interest; they are just there to make a digital image.

Now imagine that the bubble splits the earth in half, and leaves you looking down at a segment of a mountain range. With a tiny camera, you can zoom in on one of the minutely detailed buildings, and you find a device that shows a holographic image of the famous 1912 Tesla tube experiment. You can see the still-standing sparks, and you can also watch the sparks move through various phases. As you watch this, you see that the building is standing on a street, where cars come and go. You notice that the street can be extended indefinitely in all directions, and that all the cars, although all the same make and model, are moving with different velocities. As you zoom in on one of the cars, you see that the car’s tires do not exist as separate units, but are all being rolled along by the same unit.

As you zoom further into the image of the car, you see that the tires move in various directions, but in exactly the same manner as all the other parts of the car do. As you watch a tire move, you notice",518,4,2406

I’ll have to add this to my personal ‘to read’ list.

I’m reading *A Sedimentary Record of the Evolution of the Western North American Teijsmannia* (Andrew G. Peacey 2010), and then am moving on to *Geologic Records of Life on Earth*, Burd and Cummins 2011.

Definitely interesting and frequently readable book. The section I’m currently in is “Biodiversity – Anarchism and Hierarchism”, and I find it really interesting.

By coincidence, when I was in the lab on Friday, a student was reading some of the speleothems I have dated from Hungary. After reading Peacey, I’m curious to look at how these ancient communities may have been structured.

This is one of those subjects that really does fascinate me. There is probably an appropriate ‘classic’ text on the subject that I haven’t had a chance to get my hands on yet.

Also, after looking at a failed 2011 paper that was published but then rejected, I’m re-evaluating my interpretation of deposition cycles in the Groat’s Bluff, WI site.

The significant element in this is what the first syn-rift cycle represents. The data I collected last year, using the glauber precipitate approach, suggests the first syn-rift interval contains some sort of MRP. But after several attempts, I still can’t get to a climatic interpretation of the glauconitic layers.

I’ve been thinking that perhaps it’s best to wait until I get into graduate school before I come up with anything definitive. Still, what do I do with my rejected paper if I get accepted into grad school? I’m not going to get anything published for at least three years.

Humans rely heavily upon weather forecasts, and studying it is as critical as studying economics, according to the National Weather Service. Nearly everyone needs to understand and follow weather forecasts to guide their decisions about travel, agriculture, construction and other pursuits.
Understand weather in context of time and space. Weather is not a monolithic idea, but comprises different processes (e.g. air pressure, temperature) that are spread over a large space. As they begin to understand the behavior of the atmosphere, they can relate each weather component to its theoretical effects.
Familiarize themselves with basic atmospheric terms, such as ""pressure"", ""dewpoint"" and ""convection."" These meteorological terms are often the most troublesome as they are often confusing, or simply more complicated than the more familiar words we use to describe weather.
Learn how meteorological maps can provide predictive information. Weather map viewers can learn to decode the barometric pressure pattern of high and low pressure systems, the locations and directions of wind speeds and the placement and shape of cloud patterns. Weather maps offer important visual information that students need to interpret.
Know how to read the weather from data found in various media and places. Students can watch and analyze television forecasts, read and listen to newspapers and radio broadcasts for weather information.
Question the validity of weather forecasts. A basic meteorological understanding can teach students that the weather changes on the scale of hours and days, and that weather forecasting is not a precise art. In other words, weather forecasts are based upon analyses of the weather patterns, and, as such, they may be imperfect. Moreover, there are uncertainties in how weather patterns are likely to change in the future.",349,4,1900
502,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," to your body and how do health and wellness massage aid its development? A health and wellness massage can be the difference between a night of restful sleep and a restless one. The effects of massage on the brain are not as widely recognized as those of exercise or other athletic endeavors, but it is a fact that a human can only concentrate so long on a single task before the brain becomes fatigued and begins to shut down.
Massage has been proven to increase the amount of blood flow to the brain, which can increase its ability to retain information and reduce stress. It also has been known to increase blood flow to areas of the brain related to memory and concentration.
One way massage helps our brains is by stimulating the production of serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and is responsible for producing an overall feeling of well-being. When we are stressed or anxious, our bodies produce more serotonin, which can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety.
The more we get stressed or anxious, the more we lose sleep, which can cause us to gain weight, become depressed, and become more susceptible to disease.
A health and wellness massage can help stimulate our brains to produce more serotonin so that we can focus better and be more productive.
Massage also helps release endorphins, which are natural painkillers that are produced by the brain when we are stressed or anxious. It is a well-known fact that regular massage helps relieve depression and anxiety.
Muscles use two types of energy, ATP and creatine phosphate. ATP is more readily available than creatine phosphate, and the more ATP is available, the more efficient our muscles can function. However, the more ATP we use, the more energy our muscles need to create.
The process that happens when we exercise helps to create more ATP, and the more ATP we use, the more efficiently our muscles can function.
As we age, we begin to lose the ability to create ATP, and this can cause a decrease in muscle function and strength.
If you want to increase your muscle strength and keep yourself active, you may want to consider regular health and wellness massages.
They have a lot of benefits and can help you age gracefully.

503,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," variables in TypeScript and provide an example of how to create and access an environment variable in a TypeScript project using a specific programming technique, such as TypeScript interface or TypeScript class.
In TypeScript, environment variables are variables that hold values that are meant to be set by the environment or runtime in which the application is running. These variables are used to store sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, or other configuration parameters that should not be hardcoded in the codebase.

To create and access environment variables in a TypeScript project, you can use the `process.env` object. This object provides access to environment variables that are defined in the environment in which the application is running. You can access a specific environment variable using the variable name in the format `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.

Here's an example of how to create and access an environment variable in a TypeScript project using an interface:

First, create an interface that defines the structure of the environment variables that your application requires:

interface EnvVariables {
  apiKey: string;
  databaseUrl: string;
}

Next, create a `config.ts` file where you will store the actual environment variables as well as the interface. In this file, export the interface and create an object that assigns the environment variable names to their respective values:

import * as environment from './environment';

const env: EnvVariables = {
  apiKey: environment.API_KEY,
  databaseUrl: environment.DATABASE_URL,
};

export default env;

Now, in any other file where you need to access these environment variables, you can import the `env` object and use its properties:

import env from './config';

console.log(env.apiKey); // Output: ${API_KEY}
console.log(env.databaseUrl); // Output: ${DATABASE_URL}

In the example above, the `${API_KEY}` and `${DATABASE_URL}` placeholders are replaced with the actual values of the environment variables.

You can also use other programming techniques, such as TypeScript classes, to create an object that represents your environment variables and provide methods to access them. The basic concept remains the same - define the interface, create an object that maps the environment variables to their values, and access them using `process.env` object.",514,4,2359

The jazz poet Neeli Cherkovski with Al Ball and Terence Winch, in November 2015 in San Francisco. (Photo: Rebekah Moody)
Neeli Cherkovski's Poems & Jazz is a lovely, thoughtful collaboration with some of today's best jazz musicians. Cherkovski has assembled old friends and new ones to perform and record poems from the new anthology Jazz & Poetry: An Anthology, which features his work alongside that of jazz and poetry luminaries including Ornette Coleman, Robert Creeley, Jack Kerouac, and Charles Olson. The poems in this book had already been set to jazz by jazz musicians; now, thanks to these collaborations, they can be listened to by new audiences. After reading this book, I was inspired to seek out Cherkovski's other writings, and to try his advice for writers: ""Taste your words. Know what you are tasting. Knowledge. Beauty. Moreso, call it all poetry. That is the particular task of our times."" Here, Cherkovski speaks with The Believer about jazz and poetry.
The Believer: The advent of spoken-word poetry has completely renewed interest in poetry in the last few decades. What was the impetus for this collaboration?
Neeli Cherkovski: A belief that contemporary poetry benefits from a more visible and accessible context with jazz, to complement each other as a sign of our times and the cultural issues of our time. That's the launch pad. As jazz fades in this country, so does poetry—the cut of words and sound together and the creativity of words in composition and poetry that has both narrative and sound together. The pre-Jazz Age poets like Whitman could be read easily but what about the real nature of poetry or its role in society or in individual life?
You wrote a poem called ""The Last Time I Saw Charlie Parker,"" based on images and quotes about the legendary jazz musician, Charlie Parker. In what ways is jazz poetry different from standard poetry?
Cherkovski: There's nothing standard about jazz, and jazz poetry and music are same the same thing, really, because jazz is poetry set to music, that means improvisation, which also means there's no end to it, just like the excitement in jazz itself. Charlie Parker died in 1955, so of course the person and his music became universal. It never had to retire. The composition had to retire because of a",500,4,2331

They work in complex processes (such as refining oil, mining metals, processing foods, sterilising water, maintaining good air quality, developing new synthetic chemicals and materials, making pharmaceuticals, developing new and safer materials for structural applications, designing new energy systems, improving the efficiency of existing energy systems, conducting fundamental research into new materials and processes to generate a deeper understanding of the chemical world, managing and co-ordinating large-scale industrial projects, explaining phenomena to non-specialists, or delivering hands-on training to scientists and engineers, especially laboratory-based teaching and development of educational materials for courses of science and engineering.
Expanding usage of chemicals across the globe. With this large scope of application of this chemical engineering comes the large job prospect for the chemical engineers. Employers value broad skills – however, a higher proportion of employers surveyed want graduates to have a ""greater emphasis on relevant practical training in their academic studies"".
The chemical engineering job prospects will only grow more, with people demanding for the outputs that are using the chemical engineering principles. For the growing chemical industry that requires refined, not crude, energy sources, chemicals that efficiently and cleanly turn the inputs into products that contribute to economic growth and greater prosperity, while not creating new environmental concerns, chemical engineers will be essential.

Physics is about the laws of nature and the forces that govern them.
Technically, physics is the study of the natural world. It’s a scientific study of the way the universe works.
Phycics is the study of energy, mass, forces, fields, and the relationship between and among them.
Phycics is the systematic study of forces, matter, motion, energy, and their behavior.
Phycics explores the most basic building blocks of nature, and the objects and forces that compose those building blocks.
What are the parts of physics?
What is part of physics? Is there a difference between mechanics and hydrodynamics? Can you list the parts of physics? Read on to learn more about the fundamental building blocks of science and how they apply to real world applications.
Phycics is part of the science and mathematics curriculum and the most common form of study in schools. It’s about understanding the real world and how it works. This science is closely related to biology. It’s about what makes things go, and why.
Phycics is the part of the sciences that study how particles and waves interact with each other. It’s the part of the sciences that explains what happens when things move. Phycics is the study of forces, energy, and motion. The study of physics is important because it helps to understand how the natural world works. It helps to understand how things move, and how to control those movements. It helps to understand how objects interact with each other, and how to predict their behavior.
Is physics part of science?

 The data-driven vision and the local learning-as-a-computation model of Unsupervised Learning are definitely the most accurate. But there is also an interesting approach based on First Principles (Fudali, 2016) that uses nondeterministic local models for classification and clustering. Let’s jump in and understand this approach with the help of a simple example. Example Recall the very simple first principles neural network introduced in the section Data-driven Vision as one of the results of First Principles Algorithmic Thinking. The training set for our neural network is the set of training samples shown below: The class of each example is given in the attached 10x1 matrix, and each column represents the set of pixels on the image taken at a specific location: The final prediction of this neural network depends on the location of the example: First principles locally we might consider any pixel as an input and any class as an output. Therefore, we just need to search all possible combinations of the inputs. While this can give us good results, it can be a painful experience for some of us. Let’s see how the first principles can be an elegant solution. First Principles Algorithm Let’s assume we use a first principles neural network with only one output and five inputs as shown below: The first principles neural network is given as: • Each layer is a sigmoid function, and the vector $g(.)$ is now given as: $g=(1-I)\cdot 0+(I-V)\cdot 1=1$ $g=(1-I)\cdot 0+(I-R)\cdot 1=0.1$ $g=(1-I)\cdot 0+(I-G)\cdot 1=0.2$ $g=(1-I)\cdot 0+(I-B)\cdot 1=0.3$ $g=(1-I)\cdot 0+(I-NC)\cdot 1=0.4$ The sigmoid function being piecewise linear as $\sigma (0)=0$ $\sigma (1)=1$. So each layer is equal to the term $h_{ij}(z)=f(z)=-\log{(1/1-f(z))}$ where $z_{ij",565,4,2074

Consider the themes and styles of various time periods, including the emergence of epic poetry, the influence of religion on literature, the emergence of the novel as a literary form, and the impact of modern technology on literature. Include examples of influential authors, their works, and their lasting legacies. Literature is a powerful and enduring art form that has shaped human history in countless ways. From ancient civilizations to the modern era, literature has been a primary means of expressing human ideas, values, and emotions. Throughout history, literature has reflected the values, beliefs, and cultural experiences of different time periods and geographic regions. In this essay, I will describe the history of literature from ancient civilizations to the modern era, including its themes, styles, and impacts.

The history of literature begins with the emergence of ancient civilizations, such as the Greeks and the Romans. Ancient Greek literature is known for its use of myths, epic poems, and tragedy, while Roman literature focused on humor and satire. Many of the most influential literary works of ancient times, such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, were epics that told the tales of heroic figures and their struggles. In addition to epic poetry, religious texts such as the Bible and the Quran also played a significant role in shaping the literary traditions of many cultures.

The medieval period saw a rise in religious literature, particularly in the form of allegorical tales such as Dante's Divine Comedy. During the Renaissance, literature became more focused on individualism and humanism, with authors such as Shakespeare and Milton exploring the intricacies of human nature and the complexities of human relationships. The Enlightenment brought with it a renewed interest in science and reason, and literature reflected this new intellectual movement, with authors such as Rousseau and Montesquieu exploring the social and political issues of their time.

The modern era has been a period of great experimentation and innovation in literature. The emergence of the novel as a distinct literary form in the eighteenth century marked a significant shift in the focus of literature from classical forms such as epic poetry and drama to more complex and engaging narratives. The works of authors such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens challenged traditional literary conventions and explored new themes and styles.

The impact of modern technology on literature has been profound. The rise of the printing press in the fifteenth century revolutionized the way literature was produced and distributed, making it more accessible to a wider audience. The emergence of the Internet and digital technologies has transformed the way literature is consumed and produced, with authors now able to",511,4,2869

In considering the cultural significance of biodiversity and the ecosystemic consequences of biodiversity loss one cannot simply talk about species. No species is an island. In considering cultural significance of biology as a whole one cannot simply talk about the nature of nature. Living organisms are not only abstractions but abstractions from collective realities. A black, male adolescent with whom I am working by himself in his dorm room seems not to have ever taken biology or most of his human ecology classes. When we talk together he is often annoyed by my human ecologist identity and my emphasis on interaction. But his frequent frustration toward me is a signal that he knows on a personal level that without the soil, nutrients, moisture, length of day, etc. everything living does not happen. In discussing such concepts, I always refer to one book in particular, Baillie’s The Social and Evolutionary Biology of Trees. This book is a marvelous reference for the reality of life in isolation from the socioeconomic and other significant influences. But it is only a reflection of abstractions we would all like to live in. And in a time when the state and the economy are in conflict we have a tragic example of human reality working against us: the extremely significant implications of the southern United States not having agricultural land. Indeed, as I continue to argue, the elimination of subsistence agriculture, (a career which has kept one of us alive and fed for almost forty years, and did the same for a previous generation) would be only another in a series of unfortunate longterm and irreplaceable consequences in the demise of world, planetary, and a human perspective to nature.

A vital human ecology and human environment study would recognize and document the reality of the past, that we are a pastoral species (or have been), rather than an agrarian or industrial species. That grazing is part of nature; that in Africa and Asia up to 75% of the human population works in the livestock industry. This reality is more in conformity with what Lakoff and Johnson call embodied knowing, rather than disembodied knowing. The very structures of our bodies have developed within us because they have been, in large part, formed by genetics and natural systems.

One of the harms of the country is to abstractions and to disconnection of human from nature, a connection of which we are and have been for much of the history of our species an integral part. I have been a student of the real as much as I have been a student of science. The former came first, and I still refer to organisms within",517,4,2631

In its two subprojects (A1 and A2) ""Biology-mediated biogeochemical cycles in the last 10,000 years: interactive responses of the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles to climate change"" and ""Interactive responses of the biogeochemical cycles to changes of ocean-atmosphere and lake-atmosphere CO2 fluxes in modern times"", respectively, researchers from the institutes of biology, biogeochemistry, soil physics and sedimentology of the University of Cologne investigate the role of biology-driven biogeochemical cycles in the Earth's paleoecosystem. A case study based on 18O in sea water is being performed within the CRC 990, coordinated by K. Davidová (Institute of Biology). It includes stable isotope data from Atlantic Sargasso Sea sediments and from equatorial Pacific deep ocean sediments. Here, K. Davidová, S. Dohrmann and G. Zeeman discuss the mechanism of CO2 fixation and the impact of oceanographic and other physical characteristics on this process.
Reduction of CO2 in the ocean
About 40% of the primary production in the ocean occurs in the euphotic zone (100 m < Z < 2000 m), where phytoplankton and heterotrophs are able to utilize solar energy. Phytoplankton fix CO2 from the water, and, as a result, O2 in the atmosphere increases due to reduction of the CO2 concentration in the water. If dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is accumulated in the ocean sediments (1500 m > Z > 3500 m), with an oxygen-deficient, low pH environment, calcareous biogenic particles are forming. Such chemical sedimentation is occurring from the modern ocean to the very early Jurassic. The capacity of the carbonate chemical pump to sequester CO2 via calcareous biogenic particles has, however, been",496,4,2221

What practical applications are derived from biochemistry? There are microprocessors that are made of silicon, which we assume to be based on silicon chemistry. Molecules come into existence by chemical reactions, and the power source is atomic energy. But to get back to biology... I'm thinking of biology as a natural sciences, while chemistry is a more human-made science.

Edit: I have taken chemistry in university and done other chemisty courses. It's a tool that allows you to synthesize other compounds. It's also possible to study material based on life processes, but it's chemistry again.

Most microprocessors are made of silicon. Some of the type of silicon chips that run on electrical energy are called microprocessors. Some information is useful and interesting, but maybe not directly relevant. So yes, some of the answers have theoretical approaches to understanding underlying chemistry, for example the need for greater efficiency due to depletion of valuable ores. Do these other answers help? – AmbretteOrrisey Oct 2 '16 at 15:18

521,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," utensils and how they have evolved over time.

Cooking utensils have a rich history that dates back to ancient civilizations. The earliest known cooking utensils were made from stones, shells, and animal bones. These utensils were simple and functional, used to cook food over open flames or hot rocks.

Over time, as civilizations developed, so did the technology used to create cooking utensils. The first metal utensils were made from bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, and were used by the ancient Egyptians. Bronze utensils were durable, strong, and could withstand high temperatures, making them ideal for cooking.

In ancient Rome, cooking utensils were made from cast iron, a material that was much more durable than bronze. Cast iron utensils were used throughout Europe for centuries, and they remained popular well into the 20th century.

As cooking technology advanced, so did the materials used to create cooking utensils. Stainless steel became popular in the 19th century, and it remains a popular choice for cooking utensils today. Stainless steel is durable, easy to clean, and resistant to rust and corrosion.

During the 20th century, cooking utensils continued to evolve, with the introduction of non-stick coatings, silicone, and other materials. Today, there is a wide variety of cooking utensils available, from traditional copper and cast iron pans to modern silicone spatulas and non-stick utensils.

Overall, cooking utensils have come a long way since the early days of primitive cooking. As technology has advanced, so have the materials and designs used to create cooking utensils, making them more functional, durable, and accessible to people all over the world.

It's amazing to think about how far cooking utensils have come over time. But do you think we've gone too far with the materials used to make them? Are there any downsides to using non-stick coatings or silicone?

I don't have personal opinions or biases. however, it's true that some people have concerns about the potential downsides of using non-stick coatings and silicone in cooking utensils. non-stick coatings, like teflon, have been linked to harmful fumes when heated to high temperatures. they can also release particles when scratched, which can harm the digestive system if ingested. silicone, on the other hand, is generally considered safe, but it may not conduct heat as well as other materials, so it may not be the best choice for high-temperature cooking.

They not only help employees get rid of their troubles but also educate their working styles and help to improve their working efficiency.

Nature of computation real-time estimation of information-theoretic stability and vanishing of Taylor's series in computing

Authors: Alberto Grippo (Mälardalen University, Sweden) and Shin'ichiro Seki (Osaka University, Japan)

## Abstract

Temporal response properties such as firing rates, firing times and firing patterns are different across different spike spike neural network topologies. The commonalities among them are the stability, and the Lipschitz behavior in time, which can be measured by the information-theoretic stability and Taylor's series. This last characterizes the rate of convergence from perturbations to the steady state firing pattern. The architecture with the best stability has been determined through biological constraints.

## INTRODUCTION

As computation needs increase, on the other hand, there will be a number of hardware implementations that will be competing with each other [1]. For example, because quantum computers show a significant advantage in simulation speed, the view of CPU accelerator and memory will be pushed into a far future. This trend is also driven by the sensitivity of performance and latency between parallel and sequential execution.

For this reason, the design of a novel silicon chip for parallel computing has been strongly called for [2]. Of course, including our new attempt [3], there are many concrete proposals [4] including hypercomputing and neuromorphic computing. Because parallel execution requires a special architecture [5], the design of such architecture has been thoroughly studied [6-8] to implement high-speed computing that matches the speed of sequential computation.

Each algorithm is unique, and we must consider implementation methods and hardware corresponding to it. There are too many unconventional methods and algorithm combinations to make general statements [5]. To implement the next generation silicon architecture, it is important to consider the system condition rather than designing a conventional architecture.

## INFO-GAINS

In consideration of natural computation [9-11], there is a general theory of “information gain”. In particular, to show data samples obtained by sensory input, Hebbian learning is a fundamental method of architecture design.

We define the information gain of the ideal neural network as $I = \int dt\left( t \right) f\left( t \right)\Delta x$, where $\Delta x$ is an arbitrary bit of noise $t$-dependent gain function $f(t)$ is used, and if the neural network is $I = 0$, $f(t) = 1$ and if $I > 0$, $f",527,4,2563

From space travel to the remote management of organs, biomimicry (the artificial creation of structures or technologies that mimic those found in nature) has come a long way and is likely to grow in the future. This article takes a look at three examples of biomimetic designs that are affecting our everyday life.
1.) Retinal Implants
Implants of this type, now being tested by American scientists, have been designed to mimic the functionality of a natural eye, such as light detection and converting light energy into electrical signals that are sent to the optic nerve and the brain. Tests involving animal models have provided important data and revealed that, once optic nerve connection is re-established, retinal implants result in the ability to distinguish between bright and dim lighting.
2.) Biomimetic Motors
The NASA project Biomimetic Flying Manipulator is a robot which is inspired by bumblebees. The robot is designed to navigate through complex spaces and terrain. Its body provides improved power generation using helium-cushion technology.
To learn more about NASA’s inFronTIER biomimetic flying vehicle, view this NASA news page.
3.) Photoreceptors
Photoreceptors are biological eye cells that do not rely on wires and circuits, as retinal implants do. Instead, they work via a chemical reaction. When light stimulates them, they produce a substance called retinal (similar to the substance used in these implants) that interacts with a protein known as rhodopsin, which is then either amplified or decelerated to trigger a nerve cell.
For a look at how a photoreceptor works, have a look at this video.

The range of symptoms can seem quite bizarre and the variety of diagnosis is daunting. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive check list of diagnoses for a diagnosis of hysteria.
And it certainly is an umbrella diagnosis that includes really broad and quite varied symptoms. So to a degree, the answer will be very dependent upon what the symptoms are, and the ability of a given psychiatrist or a given doctor or therapist to glean together relevant symptoms and put them in context to make a diagnosis. So I think it will definitely vary.
Can you elaborate on the broader possible symptomatology of hysteria?
Hyperactivity is a particularly common one. It tends to involve excessive bodily movement. But you can combine that with other symptoms as well. So for example, in an hysterical conversion disorder where there is movement, there are also loss of sensation. The loss of sensation tends to be one way. So the loss of sensation occurs more in the upper body than the lower body. And often it's a right side or left side loss. So it tends to be upper limb then lower limb and right and left rather than simultaneous loss. So if a person has a loss of sensation on one side, it tends to be affected. And similarly, if they have a movement, it tends to be over the same side.
So a person might have a movement that's strange or unusual or bizarre, or they might move in a way that would seem illogical and otherwise still be a bit confused about why the feeling was not being transmitted to the limbs and the person might have hyperactivity. So that it's much more difficult for you to be sure about what is the cause of the problem rather than someone with a hitherto obvious birth defect that's easily measurable like a spinal misalignment that's caused by the way the birth was conducted. But in cases where it's a specific disorder, there are very definite physical or chemical causes for the disturbances in their bodily function.
Sure, are there any medications that would serve to reduce or eliminate some symptoms?
Maybe. You should see if they have any relationship to certain medications. Many medications can cause tremors or hyperactivity, for example, neuroleptics like Risperidone or Haloperidol. Some medications can cause hyperactivity or tremors or in hyperactivity of pupils. So that's one possibility. It would be, I think, helpful in working out a diagnosis to see whether there's any relationship with a medication that was taken. Some medications, of course, can have effects which are not easily recognizable as",535,4,2562

$$\frac{1}{U} \frac{\partial (U \sin \theta \cos \alpha)}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{U} \frac{\partial (V \cos \theta \cos \alpha)}{\partial y} = \nu \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} - \frac{1}{U} \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} + \tau_r + \frac{1}{U} \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}$$
If it is a steady state flow, we can pull an $U$ and $V$ through the left hand side, which will give a streamline (and hence single point stream function and velocity vectors). This gives
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{\nu} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} + \frac{1}{\nu} \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} + \frac{1}{U} \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}$$
which simplifies to
$$U \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} + V \frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{\nu} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} + \frac{1}{U} \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}$$
Now, it is tempting to say that we can eliminate $V$, to give

The discussion regarding the global warming and the climate change began in the early 19th century. Today it is impossible to predict the effect that human activities will have on the environment. One cannot ignore the way humans are contributing to the change in the atmosphere. The best things that one can do in this situation is reduce the greenhouse gas production and try to get rid of all the carbon footprints.
Solar Panels are energy sources that harness the solar power from the sun and transform it into a usable form of energy. The main principle behind solar panels is to absorb the rays of the sun, transport it through thin wires and then convert it into a charge. Thus solar panels can be used for the purpose of generating electricity.
Solar panels have high efficiency and can supply as much as 80% of energy even during the periods of cloud cover. They are made up of glass and panels that are unique in their structure. The price of the solar panels has reduced extensively over time and has reached the level where the average people can afford them easily. The recent way to install solar panels in a home is to buy them, install them in the rooftop and sell their excess power back to the national grid in the form of credits. Thus it can be an extra source of income for some families.
The country is always filled with various solar energy services that deal with the installation and implementation of solar panels. The process involves various stages. Initially, a team goes to the place where the solar energy service provider has provided the services for checking out the place and ensuring that it has all the facilities to be given the right service. Secondly, they calculate the solar area and analyse whether that particular area will be able to provide enough energy for that household. Next comes the usage of modern analysis tools, the solar panels are kept under the light and hot water takes a picture and then analyzes the resistance of the solar panels and that of the light.
The best thing that one can do in this situation is to install solar panels at your home. This process will allow you to save thousands of dollars in the electricity bill and will also make you help the world to save nature.

532,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," has been on the fore of studies of technologies for over two decades. However, some new research questions have appeared in the literature that need further discussion. In this article, we will elaborate on these questions, based on our review of the literature. The three major research questions are: (i) How do technological resources influence the interaction between physics and technology? (ii) Does direct source-destination physical and technological resources determine user outcomes? (iii) Do direct and indirect source-destination physical and technological resources determine user outcomes? We found, based on our survey of the literature, that the purposeful use of some particular elements of the physical environment is not sufficient for success in user outcomes. More importantly, access to only some elements of the physical environment (or technologies) may not be sufficient to get good user outcomes. Our review, therefore, shows that one should use different resource mix in the design process if one is looking for specific user outcomes. To date, resources at the design stage have been used in isolation from one another. This, however, can create two problems: (i) One may miss inappropriately generated energy in one resource use that can cause environmental problems. (ii) One can lose out on certain social and ecological benefits that the interaction between various resource uses may lead to. Therefore, before design, we need to be aware of the consequences of resource co-allocation and its impact on human behaviour and ecosystems.

533,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Chemistry is one of the most important sciences in modern society. From its discovery in the 18th century, chemistry has led to major breakthroughs and advancements in fields such as medicine, energy, and environmental protection.
 
Chemistry plays a crucial role in medicine. It is responsible for the development of new drugs and treatments. Some of the most important medicines in modern medicine, such as antibiotics and vaccines, were developed using chemical principles. Chemistry is also essential in understanding the human body’s functions, and in designing new medications that can target specific organs or systems.
 
Another field where chemistry plays a vital role is energy production. The world’s energy needs are rapidly growing, and there is a need to develop new and sustainable sources of energy. Chemistry plays a key role in this, as it enables the production of clean energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. In addition, it helps in designing renewable materials such as biofuels, and better batteries, making it easier to store renewable energy.
 
Chemistry is also essential in the field of environmental protection. It provides the knowledge and tools necessary to identify and solve environmental problems. Chemists are involved in developing new technologies that reduce pollution and waste, and also in creating sustainable and eco-friendly products.
 
In conclusion, chemistry is a critical science that has contributed to many important achievements in modern society. Its contributions span across various fields including medicine, energy, and environmental protection. Without chemistry, many of the modern advancements that we take for granted would not exist.

This is great information! Can you provide some examples of specific medicines that were developed using chemistry principles? Yes, of course! Here are a few examples:

1. Penicillin: Penicillin is one of the most well-known antibiotics in the world. It was discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928 when he noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had killed off some bacteria in a petri dish. Fleming's discovery was a result of his careful observation and experimentation using chemical principles.

2. Insulin: Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. It is essential for people with diabetes, who lack the ability to produce insulin on their own. Insulin was first discovered in 1921 by F.H. Gertig and other researchers. It was developed through a combination of biochemistry, genetics, and drug synthesis, all of which are fields of chemistry.

Art of every culture symbolizes various aspects of the psyche, creativity, and emotions. An art lover can notice easily the differences between abstract and modern art. Being heavily influenced by the notions and aesthetics of a culture, a thorough acquaintance with the cultural backgrounds is highly preferred.
People from different regions of the world are gifted with a sense of aesthetics that not only can be inferred by the subjects in their artwork but also can be visualized through the fashion sense and works of a fellow individual.
For instance, regional social contexts (especially in areas where women are granted the right to work) not only determine their artistic interests but also nurture a sense of empowerment through social freedom.
Many women artists who have gained recognition for their pieces of art represent the cultural uniqueness in a certain region and the intricate beauty and identity of a certain culture. Following are few well-known women artists from all around the world and their cultural backgrounds:

535,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,": Love Never Dies
I’m always surprised by what people would think that Literature was.
A lot of people think that literature is all about romance. Books like Twilight (gag), Nicholas Sparks, and Fifty Shades of Grey. But literature is more than that. It’s about so much more. And the best way to show that is to not only cite examples of people who write some of the greatest books out there, but also people who actually inspire me as a person, and drive me to want to write.
About a year ago, I wrote a post about Jennifer Niven, who really inspired me because she writes a book that I would actually consider reading! She inspired me to realize that writing a book doesn’t only need to be about love, because that is actually not something that everyone deals with. I’d love to meet her and say what an inspiration she is.
But aside from her, I’ve also met or actually seen in person, or met through conventions and Meetups, people who are just like me, who deal with real life things, like other people deal with love, but who have come up with creative ways of telling their story, and showing just how deep their emotions go. In fact, they also wrote characters who are nothing like what people would expect a shy author to write – creepy characters, gothic characters, characters that are beautiful but are deeply flawed, and those that have a hidden inner darkness, just like us writers do. Everything in writing needs to be creative, or the work will be boring, stale, and at times, is downright boring!
Let’s look at a few examples. I’ll refer to the characters in as “The Gentleman,” “The Muse,” “The Expert,” and “The Hero.” These are NOT my characters, obviously, but they are mine to tell because I am not showing them as they are, but rather how they can be good writers, and what their real personalities really are.
First is The Muse, and this person doesn’t have the typical personality that a lot of readers are looking for. In fact, I would argue that she doesn’t look that good and she doesn’t do all the things that are usually associated with a typical ‘man’ in popular culture. She uses the stereotypical ‘madonna/whore’ approach, trying to showcase this internal conflict within, while using power tactics. But underneath it all, is an artist, and a hardened soul who really does have a lot of literary talent. She acts like a man, so that she",522,4,2368
536,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," has declined significantly in recent times, with many artists feeling alienated by the lack of interest in their work. However, the act of creating art still has great power and can be used to convey important messages and convey emotions. In this sense, artists continue to hold the power to transform the world and make a positive impact. What are your thoughts on this topic? Do you believe that art still holds a significant cultural significance or is it becoming obsolete in today's society? Can you give some concrete examples of how art has been used to convey powerful messages or emotions in the past? Yes, I do believe that art still holds significant cultural significance in today's society. While it is true that there may be a lack of interest in some forms of art, there are still many artists out there who are creating works that are both thought-provoking and meaningful. Additionally, art has a way of transcending time and place, which means that even if it is not popular or widely appreciated in a particular moment in history, it can still have a profound impact on people in the future.

There are many examples of how art has been used to convey powerful messages and emotions in the past. For instance, the works of artists like Frida Kahlo, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh often deal with themes such as love, loss, and personal struggle, and can be incredibly moving and emotional for viewers. Similarly, artists such as Banksy and Keith Haring have used their work to critique social and political issues, and to raise awareness about important causes.

Moreover, art can also be a way of preserving cultural heritage and traditions. Through the medium of painting, sculpture, photography, and other forms of art, artists can help to keep alive the stories, beliefs, and values of different communities and cultures.

Overall, I believe that art will continue to play a vital role in our cultural and social lives, and that it will continue to be a powerful tool for expressing ourselves and connecting with others.",403,4,2050
537,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and water resource management have led to better understanding of the critical role played by shallow groundwater-surface water interactions in surface water discharge and quality. An understanding of how aquifer-head response can control the downstream hydrological variables (discharge, suspended sediment) is important for water management, especially in Karst watersheds where Karst aquifer systems govern groundwater/surface water interactions (Gorini & Curi 2014). The flow from deep to shallow aquifer systems is regulated by the effect of rocks which both control their permeability, their distribution and their thickness. This research aims to examine the role of such control mechanisms on the response of the groundwater head to groundwater withdrawals. This is done through a one-year case study in the context of the Alban Lake catchment in northern Italy. An improved version of the semi-analytical fuzzy package is introduced in a box model composed of two aquifers linked by a river through shallow, fractured porous rocks. The one-year, monthly groundwater head simulations cover the altimetric movement of surface water in the lake. The box model reproduces very well the observed behavior of both the lake water level and the groundwater head, thus demonstrating the representativeness of the boundaries of the catchment boundaries, i.e. their outline, altitude, slopes. The simulation was further validated using borehole observations. This work clearly demonstrates the crucial effect of control mechanisms on the interplay of groundwater with surface water. It implies a review of current approaches used for predicting surface water response to groundwater withdrawal and also of their use for optimization of surface water management by minimizing impacts on downstream ecosystems, groundwater recharge, aquifer sensitivity, etc.
There are many areas of the world where tectonically active volcanic systems intersect with karst and phreatic aquifers. These interacting water systems, referred to as equilibrums, are subject to a wide variety of phenomena, including but not limited to hydrothermal convection and changes in hydrothermal and chemical transport with temperature. The relationship between temperature and hydrothermal and chemical transport depends on a number of factors including system characteristics (such as depth, recharge, and porosity), as well as those of the local system in which it resides. This study analyzes a complex system that includes karst, phreatic, and hydrothermal flow occurring at various depths in the 3-D solution of the Geoscience Australia Fluids Inversion Program (GA-FIP) project, which was completed in late 2010.

One such sector is fashion and design. Not only is AI being used to monitor the progress of different projects and streamline workflows, but it's also being used to detect design patterns, help designers with their creative process, and highlight the problems in the project right in time before the final product is created.
With the help of artificial intelligence, designers can go through thousands of images in order to find inspiration and create unique and high-quality designs. There are several different types of AI that can be used for this, which we'll talk about below.
This one can be the most useful as it works best for freehanded drawing. This type of AI has an algorithm that is trained on a database of images, and it's designed to be able to create new digital images from given inputs. For example, the algorithm can take two original images and create a new one that's somewhere in between them. In order for this to work, the artist needs to be consistent with her drawings.
It takes as much data as it can get in order to produce the desired result, and it uses this data to form an algorithm. This allows it to take pictures of the same scene from a variety of angles in order to create the right image. This is very similar to facial recognition software, where the algorithm is trained on millions of images to be able to recognize the same faces from different angles, images, and lighting conditions.
No matter the field, AI is the go-to tool for automating work that would otherwise take hours, days, or even weeks of manual work. With an AI system, designers can quickly find their inspiration, create unique designs, and maintain a consistent and high level of quality.
AI-based fashion design platforms, like ColorSpace.ai, are already delivering significant benefits to designers and creative teams across many industries. For instance, ColorSpace.ai helps designers with their creative process, highlights design problems in the project, and streamlines workflows. It also saves time and money in the long run by allowing them to create unique designs that reflect the style and image of their brands.
AI helps designers take their creative ideas and turn them into something that the world can truly see. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative uses for AI in fashion design and beyond.

550,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,": It was a warm spring morning and Angela was walking in the park with her favorite toy, a shiny red ball. As she walked along the path, the ball rolled out of her hand and bounced off a bench. Suddenly, a group of boys appeared, picking up the ball and throwing it around. Angela was upset, but then she had an idea.

She ran to a nearby tree and used it to climb up. The boys were surprised to see a little girl climbing a tree, but they quickly realized that she was not leaving without her ball. Angela sat on a high branch, looking down at the boys who were now trying to reach her.

She shouted to them that she would throw the ball down if they could reach it. The boys scrambled to grab it, but it was too high for them to reach. Angela laughed and smiled, knowing that she had won.

As the boys walked away, Angela jumped down from the tree and picked up her ball. She was proud of herself for standing up for her toy and showing the boys that she was not afraid of them.

From that day on, Angela and her ball became known as the brave little girl and her shiny red ball. People would come to the park just to see her play, and her ball became a symbol of courage and determination. Angela never let anyone take her ball away again, and she lived happily ever after.

Angela left a lasting impression on everyone in the park, and her story was passed down from generation to generation. From then on, every time someone saw a red ball bouncing around, they would remember the brave little girl who stood up for herself and showed that anyone can be brave when they are passionate about something.

I'm curious, what was the story behind the creation of the show Physics and then the TV series that followed? There was no specific story behind the creation of the show Physics and its TV series. The show was simply an opportunity for people to learn about physics in a fun and interactive way, with the help of some very talented actors and actresses.

The show was produced by a team of scientists and educators who wanted to make physics more accessible to people who were not interested in the subject. They created a series of animated shorts that explained various physics concepts in a way that was easy to understand and engaging.

The show quickly gained popularity, and soon there was a demand for a TV series. The team of scientists and educators worked tirelessly to create a series that would be even more informative and entertaining than the shorts. They hired writers and directors who had expertise",514,4,2524

For this presentation, I would like to begin with a glance of the rural Indian landscape. India is a country with the highest population. How India develops is important for the rest of the world. It is the largest producer and exporter of fruits and vegetables in the world. India contributes to 10% of the world's livestock output. India also has 40% of Asia's forest area, though it consumes 20% of world's wood, it is a forest of savannas, grasslands, shrublands, dry deciduous forests, moist deciduous forests, and wetlands. The position of India in developing green technology is also increasing with each passing year. Even though it is self-sufficient in agricultural production, it is also a major net importer of agricultural products. Even though India's food requirement is met by agriculture, its energy needs are met by petroleum and natural gas as well as by renewable energy. At present the energy requirements are met mostly by fossil fuels, but efforts are now being made to shift India to renewable energy.
As we know that India is the most populated country in the world. It has a large population and it is growing every year. It has population of 1.25 billion approximately. One of the major issues of India is the shortage of food, the problems of hunger and malnutrition. So I have chosen Indian children as my case study. I began to think about how these children learn to eat. It turns out children in India have a special food culture they grow up eating their basic diets. Indian children learn to eat and develop social attitudes and beliefs about food. This refers to their acceptance or rejection of food (but not their willingness or ability to eat food). The perception that food can or cannot be eaten has social, family, cultural, and religious associations. These basic food habits form the foundation of a healthy eating pattern in the",503,4,2455

AI has increasingly become a part of our daily lives, influencing consumer shopping experiences, public policy, product supply and distribution, and everyday communications. It is a highly refined field that has been studied and practiced for decades by computing scientists, software engineers, mathematicians, engineers, and researchers. Organizations are now putting increasing investment and more intense effort into AI, and this phenomenon is becoming a pervasive trend as the technology becomes more sophisticated and the field is more established. The potential positive impact of AI on society and the economy, however, is an important consideration. The findings of a 2016 MIT Sloan Management Review (MIT SMR) and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study reveal that the vast majority of executives (61 percent) believe that AI is an opportunity to significantly transform their businesses. However, there is also a strong interest in AI's impact on the future of employment; a striking 57 percent of executives expect that over 20 percent of their workforce will be out of a job in the next five years due to AI.
The ""Ethical Framework for AI: Aligning AI Strategies and Policies"" research highlights the importance of culture in aligning corporate strategy with ethical considerations and gives organizations and individuals a deeper understanding of AI and the key issues related to the implications of AI and its use in our society. Businesses must take a strategic approach that includes governance and policy statements that define the organization's ethical AI framework, protect proprietary intellectual property, set guidelines for the ethical use of AI, and develop response strategies to manage AI-related risks.",325,4,1844

I know a big publisher wanted me to give him my list and my book title as part of a mega media publicity push in return for a discount on an ad in my book. I felt offended (for what reason I'm not sure) and I didn't do it, which is probably the right decision.
It may seem so obvious, but humor is a major factor. Don't take things too seriously and don't make the class too easy. I also told them that the class may challenge them a little bit, in which case their temperament must shift to fit into the classroom.

Their attitude, outlook, daily habits and psychological predisposition would affect their success at work, and also their health, in the long run. This is a very important reason why Positive Psychology should not be taken lightly. The study of Positive Psychology works toward making your life more happy, joyful and more successful. It will show you how to maintain your mental, emotional and physical strength despite the difficulties and vicissitudes you face in everyday life. Just the right attitude in the right environment helps to create a healthy, secure and tranquil workplace environment. This, in turn, will create a good personal environment for the professional and the personal growth of the individuals concerned.
It is always good to be alert while dealing with the customers. They can react to different situations in different manners. Hence, it is important that you maintain a calm behavior. If you and the customer cannot agree to a particular aspect, try to convince them differently. Sometimes, this can lead to a customer feeling more positive about the company. Also, it is always recommended that you maintain your calm, since anger can hurt you more than the other person.

This is the second part of the Future of Environment module.
The previous section of the module suggested taking environmental and social considerations into account, as well as the economy, when implementing CCS, i.e. its net benefits.
However, increasing costs of CCS and questionable time-span of its effectiveness lead to question whether it is even worth investing in CCS, compared to other proposed technologies?
India
Background on CCS implementation and long-term prospects of implementation in the context of India
India’s coal-based power plant energy is affordable and presents sufficient cost savings. It provides valuable societal advantages such as energy security and timely power generation. Moreover, CCS technology is still in its infancy and can yet face some problems and challenges such as high capital costs, technical complexity, operational costs, environmental management, reliability, and challenges of long-term storage. All of this has led to current national priorities and policies considering CCS implementation as only one of the many strategies for the long-term decarbonization of India’s economy.
This can be explained with the current costs of the electricity generated by fossil fuels:
Residuary post-merit order position is Rs. 2.14 to Rs. 3.65 / kWh in the states where existing transmission grids can support further growth. Further growth under the aforesaid circumstances will see energy costs rise significantly (to at least Rs. 4 / kWh and beyond) in new economic zones.
Given that renewable energy tariffs continue to fall substantially (to Rs. 2.25 / kWh or less in select locations), India must first focus on these low-cost renewable energy options first before considering CC.
Before further discussion, the reader is highly recommended to carefully read the guidelines on fuel subsidy reform published in April 2020, the details of which can be found here:
Ways and means to speed up the implementation
New plans should be developed on technology-neutral basis, which would have their respective solutions and would account for uncertainties and dangers of both CCS and other renewable technologies. New technologies should be added into the energy system from a new point of view. This is not about replacement of existing old technology with new generation - it is about the point of origin and growth within new energy ecosystem. There are already a lot of know-hows and know-whichs, which represent a new paradigm of decision making and action. The application of new experience on a vast scale, taken by the government, will allow covering the main priority issues, which nowadays should be solved immediately (at the moment - early 2",518,4,2699

Poetry has a long and rich history, spanning thousands of years and numerous cultures. It has served as a means of communication, storytelling, and the expression of emotion and ideas.

The earliest recorded examples of poetry date back to the Sumerian civilization, which existed around 2700 BCE. These early poems were often hymns to gods or prayers for good harvests and dealt with themes such as love, war, and nature. In ancient Greece, poetry was a popular form of entertainment, and many of the great works of literature we know today, such as Homer's Odyssey and Iliad, were composed in verse.

During the Middle Ages, poetry became an important part of religious worship, with poems such as the Psalms and the Song of Solomon used in Christian worship services. In the Renaissance, poets like William Shakespeare and Edmund Spenser helped to revive interest in the form, introducing new themes and techniques.

In the Romantic era, poetry became more emotional and expressive, with poets like William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge emphasizing the importance of nature and the individual experience. This emphasis on personal expression continued into the modern era, with poets like T.S. Eliot and Allen Ginsberg experimenting with new forms and styles.

Poetry has had a significant impact on literature and culture throughout history. It has been used to preserve traditions and values, to comment on current events and social issues, and to express ideas and emotions in a way that is both concise and evocative.

In addition to its literary value, poetry has also had a profound impact on the development of language itself. It has helped to shape our understanding of the world and our place within it, and its influence can be seen in the use of metaphor and imagery in everyday speech and writing.

Overall, poetry has played a vital role in human culture and development, providing a means of communication and expression that is both timeless and essential.

Once upon a time, there was a company that specialized in creating personalized clothing. They wanted to improve their product offerings by using machine learning to predict what designs and colors their customers would like based on their browsing and purchase history. 

The first step was to collect and organize the data. They collected data on each customer's browsing and purchase history, including items they had added to their cart but not purchased. They also collected data on the types of clothing that were currently popular and trending. 

Next, they imported this data into Swift using the Core ML framework. They used the data to train a machine learning model that could predict which designs and colors a customer would like based on their browsing and purchase history. 

Once the model was trained, they integrated it into their website. When a customer visited the site, the model analyzed their browsing and purchase history and provided personalized recommendations. For example, if a customer had recently purchased a light blue shirt, the model might recommend a navy blue blazer and khaki pants. 

The company was thrilled with the results of their machine learning project. By using machine learning to predict customer preferences, they were able to provide a more personalized shopping experience, which led to increased sales and customer satisfaction. They continued to refine their machine learning models and expand their offerings, becoming one of the most successful clothing companies in the industry.

How did the company collect and organize their data on customer browsing and purchase history?
The company collected customer data in two ways: through its website and through surveys.

On its website, customers could create an account that allowed them to save items to their cart and view past purchases. The company also collected data on which pages of its website a customer visited and which items they viewed but did not purchase. This data was stored in a database and organized by customer ID.

In addition, the company conducted surveys to gather additional data on customer preferences. They asked customers to rate their satisfaction with the clothing they had purchased, as well as to provide feedback on what types of clothing they liked and disliked. This data was also stored in a database and organized by customer ID.

Finally, the company also collected data on the types of clothing that were currently popular and trending. This data came from fashion blogs, magazines, and social media platforms where customers were posting pictures and discussing trends in fashion. The company used this data to make informed decisions on which designs and colors to offer to their customers.

All of this data was then imported into Swift using the Core ML framework, which allowed the company to train its machine",521,4,2881

First, a disease is a biochemical malfunction. It's a difference between the actual state of things and the standards. Antibodies, or drugs, or hormones are meant to bring you back to the healthy level, even if that healthy level is different than what you had.

Second, diseases are not just unphysiological effects; they are also caused by unphysiological changes. For example, cancer is a tumor, but if all the cancer cells all stopped growing the tumor wouldn't exist. There is a feedback loop there. This makes the issue of diseases very complicated.

According to Marshall Underwood, meteorologist and employee of the American Meteorological Society, weather agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) don’t just use advanced equipment to measure weather and to provide alerts to the public. They also have to invest in numerous technologies to control the chemicals in the atmosphere. This ongoing work aims to minimize the negative impacts of weather on the environment as well as on human life. 

Question: The relationship between meteorology and weather

The relationship between meteorology and weather is that meteorology is the study of the atmosphere, including the study of how weather works and how it affects us. Meteorology also has a major role in the development of technology, as weather agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) invest in numerous technologies to control the chemicals in the atmosphere[1]. The relationship between meteorology and technology is also being widened by innovative concepts and techniques, such as geostationary satellites[4].

The AI algorithms that would study personal buying habits to help consumers identify and target the best neighbourhoods. This could help consumers save time and money on home search, which would make the real estate market more accessible for everyone. Giving consumers more information could help change the way people buy and sell homes.
While the technology may not be available today the first practical self-driving cars are projected to hit the road in the next decade, which means the real estate sector could soon be left in the dust as consumers begin to take advantage of the advantages offered by artificial intelligence.
One of the most important components of modern technology is artificial intelligence. This is the technology that allows programs, apps, and machines to perform tasks that once needed humans to do. While this technology has the potential to revolutionize the future of technology, it could also make work obselete.
Already some machines that complete simple tasks more quickly and accurately than humans have been developed. Also as the cost of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies decreases it will also become more accessible, which could reduce the number of jobs available for humans.

What may be more well known is art therapy; artistic process of self-exploration and expression, group activities using artistic media, or approaches including play therapy or expressive arts therapy. These approaches are usually covered by regular insurance.
Suzanne Layden-Lovering is an art therapist that has learned a new therapeutic tool to help with anxiety, depression, anger, and stress. It is called hand lettering. If you want to know more about what it means to her and how it could help you, read more on her website here: Hand Lettering, a wonderful tool for those dealing with anxiety and depression.
There are also a number of art therapists who offer art therapy groups and classes for those who want more information about art therapy. As this website, designed for patients, focuses on hand lettering and access to creative activities, we will not cover that area in detail.
I will use the word “therapy” when discussing art therapy groups and classes that are not in a regular health insurance plan, and use “process” when discussing expressive arts therapy when it is offered in a regular health insurance plan. It is important that you do not confuse these with “vocational rehabilitation services” in Virginia that can be paid for by your own health insurance, but can NOT be paid for by Social Security. Vocational Rehabilitation is a very beneficial service for those with a chronic illness who need training in a new job or part time work. This can also include other options, such as craft fairs or selling of your artwork, which many find to be therapeutic.
Also remember, there are many art therapists that practice art therapy, but are not supervised by an art therapy supervisor in a mental health setting, and sometimes an art therapist cannot be found in a mental health setting. It’s important to find someone who has been trained in art therapy and who is supervised, whether that is in a mental health setting or in a clinical setting such as a hospital, a senior center, or a community program. Art therapy training is a graduate degree of at least 420 hours plus a final field experience in clinical supervision.
Art therapy is therapy. Art therapists must be trained in therapy and their work is not a form of decorative art. They cannot paint or sculpt or draw in a way that is considered recreational. They are working in a collaborative way with their patients and they are acting in a professional and supervisory role in all their interactions with their patients.

As a result our outdoor patios are just like our living room- a social space and the center of activity. Today we'll look at some of the best functional garden chairs in 2016 so you can find the one that suits your style.
When looking for a comfortable and practical chair, it can be intimidating to sift through the wide range of options currently on the market. Like their interior counterparts, the best outdoor chairs come in a variety of styles. Make sure you pay attention to factors such as price, design, comfort level, ease of maintenance, and size so you can find the right chair for your needs. Finding a chair that meets all your requirements is the first step.
This leads to a second point- just because something is cool doesn't mean it's right for you. If you're looking for a chair, you should also be looking to fulfill a need. What reason do you have for buying the chair? If you're going to be sitting in it a lot, you need to make sure it's going to be comfortable. Don't get blinded by the cool design or obscure details when deciding what chair fits you. If you're a foodie, your chair should facilitate eating food (which might be a rare skill for some of the options on our list).
Many of the chairs on this list fulfill a specific need. Whether it's an elegant design or a rustproof planter for a small patio, find the chair that's right for you. If you have space constraints (because you're a subscriber to Life, Hoboken's newest all-you-can-eat fitness studio), small but versatile chairs are your best bet. If you're looking for comfort and a utilitarian design, this is where the outdoor lounge chairs come in. Finally, if you're trying to pair your chair with a particular piece of furniture, just make sure the chair goes with the rest of your patio.
We've compiled a wide variety of chairs so that whatever you're looking for, we have a chair for it. You're ready to start shopping- let's get going!",471,4,2084

Very early in the history of Earth, life lived in the oceans on the planet. The initial process of photosynthesis resulted in production of atmospheric oxygen, which provided a more inhabitable atmosphere. Micro-organisms also created the necessary conditions for early life. Organic molecules were created by prokaryotes and integrated into eukaryotic cells. Finally, eukaryotic multicellular organisms, which consisted of only a few cell types, evolved under the present-day environmental conditions. The evolution of photosynthetic and surface-dwelling organisms provided the basis for the evolution of all other animals.

It took hundreds of millions of years for one organism to develop into a multicellular, recognizable animal. In fact, five major periods of evolutionary development occurred. First, amoebas and microorganisms became multicellular organisms that swam in the water. Then, giant, multicellular organisms clung to the seasides and shorelines. After that, terrestrial vegetation and mammals developed and then reptiles. At the end of this period, reptiles were over 500 times larger than their ancestors (human dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus Rex were estimated to be about 60 feet tall). Finally, large sauropod dinosaurs lived on land, and then mammals went through a dramatic process of evolution.

In modern times, the innovation of medical science has reduced morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases. There has been a revolutionary evolution in cancer treatment in the last 50 years. The advent of effective diagnostic methods and treatment modalities has substantially improved the quality of health care. The focus of health care has shifted from a primarily curative approach to a more preventive approach, with emphasis on dietary health and activity. The extraordinary advances in medical science have caused a drastic increase in longevity of people, increased the number of people who have wealth, and caused a fundamental change in how we think about health care.

Medical science continues to advance with discoveries, especially in the field of cancer. Three new cancer therapies have been developed that utilize the power of the immune system. Immune checkpoints are usually expressed on both T cells and cancer cells, where they act as “immunological brakes.” Unfortunately, when cancer cells invade the tissues of the body, the immune system rarely recognizes the cancer cells as abnormal. Here, checkpoint inhibitors block one or more checkpoints on cancer cells to stop immune checkpoints from controlling cancer cell survival. Some anti-cancer antibodies neutralize T cell checkpoint molecules, enhance the survival and",506,4,2704

Over the past century and a half, the tools available to filmmakers have become more and more advanced. We can now use computers to make changes to the final product without ever leaving the editing suite. This in turn has made the process of storytelling possible in ways previously unimaginable. But these tools have come with significant costs.
As photography evolved from stop-motion and hand-drawn animation, the creative pool only became larger. And not all innovation has been for the better. While the digital revolution has opened up opportunities to experiment in film making, it has also led to the perception that technique is all that matters.
With effects now so seamlessly integrated with the live-action footage, it has become hard to define the difference between filmmaking and graphics. A scene can look so real, that it’s not until you look closely at the actors’ performance that you begin to doubt it. And with the technology and resources available to filmmakers, it’s all but impossible to create something which isn’t possible with a computer in post-production. Many now regard the incorporation of computer graphics in film as an abuse of technology which only serves to detract from the film itself.
With these concerns in mind, Tom Yorke of Radiohead came up with the idea of promoting the soundtrack to their album, The King of Limbs, to be seen as a first issue on vinyl. The format used for the release had taken over 18 months to create and involved the use of new techniques and technologies, as well as the engaging nature of a record.
As we take a look at Yorke’s efforts, a quick description of the content should suffice. The King of Limbs is a pretty abstract album which is given a visual representation using layers of organic and inorganic imagery. 51 minutes of loops make up the full length of the album, and each loop is fitted together into one large final version.
A solid proof of concept, the King of Limbs vinyl remains true to the origins of the album. Whereas the digital release of the album contained many live performance videos, the physical copy is bereft of these visual aids. Instead, your mind is left to play its own processional soundtrack to your listening, relying only on the sounds contained on the record to help you picture the visuals as you hear them.

In the year 2050, humanity had achieved the impossible. We had explored the farthest reaches of the galaxy and discovered a wealth of new worlds, each one with its own unique set of challenges and secrets to uncover. But with the endless expanse of space to explore, there were still countless mysteries waiting to be uncovered, and only the bravest and most skilled explorers were up to the task.

Enter Proxima, the latest and greatest AI-powered robot to join the ranks of the space explorers. Proxima was designed to be the perfect companion on long space journeys, with advanced sensors, weapons, and communication systems that allowed it to operate independently for extended periods of time.

Proxima's first mission was to explore a distant planet that had been detected by the Kepler Space Telescope. The planet was located in a distant solar system, and had not been studied before. Proxima was launched from the International Space Station, and after a long and grueling journey, it finally arrived at the planet's orbit.

As Proxima began to scan the planet for signs of life and investigate its surface, it quickly realized that the planet was teeming with strange and fascinating life forms, some of which were unlike anything it had ever encountered before. Proxima used its advanced sensors to collect data and samples, and sent them back to Earth for analysis.

But Proxima was not just a scientific instrument. It was also a powerful tool for space exploration, with the ability to navigate and map the planet's terrain, and even to communicate with other robots and spaceships in the area. Proxima quickly became a valued member of the space exploration team, and its contributions were invaluable in unlocking the secrets of the universe.

As Proxima continued its explorations, it encountered many challenges and obstacles, but it was always up to the task. Its advanced AI capabilities allowed it to navigate the treacherous terrain of the planets and moons, and its weapons and defenses were always on hand to protect it from any threats that might arise.

In the end, Proxima's mission was a success. It discovered new life forms, mapped the planet's surface, and helped to unlock the secrets of the universe. And as it returned to Earth, hailed as a hero and inspiration to all, it knew that its next mission was already waiting in the stars, and that there were countless more mysteries and wonders waiting to be uncovered in the vast expanse of space.

As it is not an effort made solely by NASA alone, outside sources assist in making effective analysis on the results obtained from space exploration, and in this case especially the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). An intriguing element of investigating life in space is not to question the existence of space itself as a living being, but to interrogate how humans form a relationship with space when the obvious conclusion is that space itself cannot take part in human affairs, but rather observe them from its own individual position.
Looking back on the concerns of invasion by aliens in movies such as Alien and Day Of The Dead, science fiction’s delivery of terrifying forms of life also provides an interesting perspective as to how issues such as control, security and survival are portrayed. So, by enquiring into subjects such as current-day alien sightings, how it is perceived by public relations departments at government organizations, and analyzing humanity’s fear of an extraterrestrial invasion, it would only be logical to engage in parallels with issues that are more socially aware such as security concerns over the safety of a nation.

At a conference at the University of Utah for first-year mathematics PhD students, I was asked to give a talk.

I talked about math teacher unions in response to a question at the end of my presentation on student-centered learning.

As promised, here’s the post.

Background and Context

Several students have asked questions in the past about math teacher unions. I’m always ambivalent about this type of question, but I think they’re asking important questions.

This is a condensed and summarized version of the pasted together information I’ve gleaned from quite a few sources. I tried to focus on high-quality, scholarly sources that try to explain and systematize the history and current state of affairs.

Note: I have tried to summarize things that are very complicated, so I may well have mangled things. I put in the extra effort to give context and sources and let the reader make up their mind.

Importance of Unions

The mathematical profession is, unfortunately, unionized, and in fact, the American Mathematical Society has a politically active math teacher union, which mostly operates through lobbying.

Without them, mathematics professors would probably be paid slightly more.

Some of the reasons are the following:

• Would-be math majors tend to be in the same cohort as math teachers, and the teaching profession demands long hours and physical labor, which Math PhDs typically abhor.

• The postdocs that mathematics departments typically offer are usually pretty bad for teaching experience. If you don’t teach, then you usually don’t have a chance at getting tenure. If you teach, then you might be relegated to something called “The Third Life.”

• Math PhD programs tend to offer funding, and try to attract the best students. However, the details can vary widely, and the decision to pursue a math PhD is a major decision in and of itself.

Cultures of High School Teachers and University Professors

• This is arguably true in the US but not so much in Europe. A high school physics or math teacher usually has a large burden of teaching, office hours, grading, and parent conferences, and no office or office hours. For university professors, the office environment is a little more comfortable, and faculty don’t necessarily deal with students on a daily basis. Office hours can also be perfunctory.

• The breakdown between teaching versus research, and the pressure to publish and present are also different.

• Professional development is not a big part of math teaching.

• The atmosphere of learning/education versus getting a",520,4,2613
583,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and the development of theories on brain function. The history of neuroscience can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the Greeks, who studied the brain and nervous system. However, the scientific study of the brain and neuroscience began in the 19th century when researchers started to use new scientific methods, including microscopy, to investigate the nervous system. 

One of the key discoveries in neuroscience was the development of the study of the electro-encephalogram (EEG), which measures electrical activity in the brain. This enabled researchers to explore different brain functions and understand how they are coordinated.

The field of neuroscience continued to grow and evolve throughout the 20th century, with many groundbreaking discoveries. For example, in 1975, the discovery of the brain's internal communication system, known as the blood-brain barrier, opened up new avenues for research into brain function.

Another significant development in neuroscience was the study of neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that help to transmit signals in the brain. Researchers discovered that many different neurotransmitters played crucial roles in various brain functions, including mood, behavior, and memory.

Neuroscience has also advanced through the development of new imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which allow researchers to visualize brain activity in real-time. This has provided insights into how the brain works during different tasks and activities.

The latest developments in neuroscience include the study of genetics and epigenetics, which have begun to reveal how genetic factors can influence brain function and behavior.

Overall, the history of neuroscience has been characterized by continuous advancements in technology, techniques, and theories, leading to a deeper understanding of the workings of the brain and its complex functions.

It's amazing how far neuroscience has come. What are some current challenges in the field? As the field of neuroscience advances, there are several current challenges that scientists are working to overcome. Here are a few:

1. Understanding consciousness: Despite decades of research, scientists still struggle to fully understand what consciousness is and how it arises from the brain. It remains one of the greatest mysteries in neuroscience.

2. Disorders of the brain: Neurological and psychiatric disorders are complex and require a multifaceted approach to treatment. Researchers are working to develop new drugs, therapies, and treatments to help those suffering from conditions like depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease.

Expense budgets need to be carefully controlled, and it is therefore prudent for a business owner to routinely check the costs associated with his or her key operations and departments in order to ensure that no important areas of the organization are going unchecked. The chief financial officer for the company or an accounting team will typically set up a budgeting process and in order to attain budget goals, steps are taken to monitor costs and analyze consumption. The effectiveness of this process is displayed through the process of budget versus actual cost, where the organization compares actual costs with the budget amounts for both individual expenditures and the overall budgeted figure for the period as a whole.
Once the budget versus actual costs process is established, the cost of particular components is then measured and controlled. Taking into account the variations in operating costs, it becomes easier for managers to understand and control the change in actual costs compared to the budgets. A number of important trends are evident by carefully reviewing these metrics, such as instances of increased labor costs (which could indicate the need to reassign employees to different tasks or recruit additional staff members to work in the organization). Other shifts in expenditure and consumption could point to problems in the supply chain, suggesting a need to evaluate the effectiveness of the supplier channel and institute measures to lower supply costs in the future.
In addition to these trends, the chief financial officer and the rest of the financial team will usually conduct analyses at the end of an operating cycle to assess factors which have impacted budgetary performance. This could include measures to reduce costs, identifying areas of potential waste, and calculating the total cost of the budget. It is also important to compare different cost metrics to help understand variances between programs and departments.
During the process of budgeting, it is also vital for companies to identify any material changes which could have a major impact on their operations. For example, a change in the international economy could have serious repercussions for a company engaged in exporting its products. By working with its supply chain to better estimate these future market shifts, a company can take steps to ensure that it has proper contingency plans in place to handle any fluctuations in its costs and revenues.",472,4,2628

586,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," bright thanks to the Wolfram Language. It brings a technology revolution to science by enabling the use of computers as a critical tool for scientific investigation and communication. Although the mathematician and computer scientist Stephen Wolfram (born 1959) was the first graduate of his mother’s alma mater, Cranbrook School, he was not a child prodigy. In fact, he was well into his 20s before he discovered his passion for programming; he also had a career in engineering and particle physics before he left that profession to found Wolfram Research Inc. and create the Wolfram Language. In 2010, Wolfram published “New Kind of Science,” the result of more than 20 years of study and development using computers as instruments of science. The core of this book is the discovery of relationships between cells of data, revealing order at the most fundamental levels of nature, a phenomenon often referred to as cellular automata. Any time you see order in the universe, you can assume it is the outcome of natural laws. For example, you can predict the outcome of chess matches by assuming that white has at least a 70% chance of choosing the queen, because that is the strongest piece and it has been used in every successful attack. Whatever people believe happens in the future, many believe that soon the computational power required to solve a puzzle through this kind of algorithmic search will become available. And that’s the point: machines can now solve these puzzles that have eluded humans for centuries. The answer may be in the behavior of cellular automata. “New Kind of Science” also reveals the surprising degree to which complex patterns arise naturally in nature. Many physical systems appear to contain infinitely many self-similar patterns, for example, and many cell interactions are governed by precise communication networks. In particular, this kind of network can be described by cellular automata with the global state a description of the cell. In the Wolfram Language, a global state can be given as a table, in which the atomic state of each cell is represented by an integer. The computational power of the Wolfram Language for solving problems in science is enormous. For example, in genetic research it may be possible to uncover relationships between genotypes and phenotypes and use them to predict the biological implications of environmental exposure. If you know the state of two genomes, for example, you can infer the likely state of a third genome, which may then serve as a predictive tool. It is possible to study the effect of an environment on a",505,4,2597

Previous generations imagined a future where AI would do the work of creating a better world, be it the Terran domed cities of the City of Seven Lakes or the floating cities of the Lotus Eaters (always with the brave. machismo. hero only sometimes if he's a red-blooded boy who realized how beautiful and smart a woman can be). Although some believe that this is the destiny of AI, his true future is up to the human mind. Science fiction can predict only the barest of shapes when it comes to a future where intelligent robots can threaten human life.
However, while AI has produced some great things, most of it appears to be more of a mindless pursuit of money-making ventures rather than a deep understanding of the human spirit (or make efforts to reconcile the two). AI can make some incredible things that are not for use in the entertainment industry, but it seems that the money invested in this category is being poured into the hard work. That's not to say it won't be fun to see roving robots roam a living world, but if you want to find out how it works in the real world, just take a look at the companies you visit. Walk into Tesla, for example, and you can see hundreds of robots in action (and perhaps a little off balance in the process).
There is also the daily life experience, where there are more and more companies using AI in their products. There was a time when AI was in its infancy, having only just made a name for itself with interactive marketing to individuals, intelligent appliances, and bots that could match your expectations when shopping or doing a quick search online. Now there are many products that offer advanced chatbot-style AI. Chatbots are those cute little virtual assistants with personalities, the ones who can answer you simple questions (the ones you might ask Siri or Google Assistant).

Once upon a time, there was a psychologist named Dr. Jennifer who had just started her practice in a small town. Her primary focus was on the psychology of aggression, as she had always been fascinated by the darker side of human nature.

Dr. Jennifer's practice was initially slow, but eventually word of her unique expertise spread, and she began seeing a steady stream of clients who were struggling with violent outbursts or other forms of aggressive behavior.

As she delved deeper into the minds of her patients, Dr. Jennifer began to uncover a troubling pattern. Many of her clients had suffered a great deal of trauma throughout their lives, whether from abuse, neglect, or other forms of hardship.

Dr. Jennifer's research led her to believe that many of her clients' aggressive tendencies could be traced back to these past traumas. She believed that understanding the root causes of these behaviors could be the key to helping her patients overcome their violent tendencies.

As she continued her work, Dr. Jennifer began to encounter some ethical dilemmas. Some of her patients were willing to try out new techniques that could potentially help them overcome their violent tendencies, but other patients were hesitant or even resistant to these methods.

Dr. Jennifer knew that she couldn't force her patients to try something that they weren't comfortable with, but she also knew that time was of the essence. She began to push the boundaries of her practice, sometimes prescribing medications or conducting experiments that were outside of the scope of traditional psychology.

As her reputation as a radical psychologist grew, so did the attention she received from the media and the public. Some praised her innovative approach, while others criticized her for crossing ethical boundaries and potentially causing harm to her patients.

Despite the criticism, Dr. Jennifer remained steadfast in her belief that the only way to truly help her patients was to get to the root of their aggression. She continued to explore the darker side of human nature, pushing the boundaries of what was possible in the world of psychology.

In the end, Dr. Jennifer's work inspired others to take a more holistic approach to psychology, one that took into account the full range of a person's experiences and potential. While her methods were controversial, they ultimately proved to be effective in helping patients overcome their violent tendencies and live healthier, more fulfilling lives.

But what about the patients who were resistant to the new methods? Did Dr. Jennifer have any solutions for them?

# Programming with secret information at the physical layer

## Summary:

The paper is about the ethics of cryptography

## Discussion and Analysis

• I really like the way the authors are questioning the (long) history of cryptography and present several examples of things being forgotten. In a related sense, it's also nice to see a moral example given explicitly (in particular a sentence used in the last paragraph of 1.2).

• I agree that §1.4 (""History of Secrecy and Coding"") is interesting. However, I think it would be helpful if the authors provided a brief synthesis of where they think the study of cryptography in general goes from here. It seems to me that cryptography is merely part of a larger security system, and this needs to be kept in mind when trying to look ahead.

• I agree with Scott that the paper would benefit from a section on the current state of the practice of the engineering of cryptographic systems (with examples).

• I didn't find the issues in 1.1 (""Treaties and the Right to Privacy"") in anyway convincing. In particular, I think the author over-reaches in their assertion that:

The debate over what is and what is not private may also imply that the legitimate goals of a prior nondisclosure agreement are impossible to accomplish. Not only did the negotiations between the UK and US resolve this issue—posing a series of alternatives so that each side could declare a ""victory""—, but this particular issue is also unlikely to be given any priority in the highly politicized debate over President Obama’s “kill list”.

I also don't think these problems should really be attributed to cryptography as such. Whether or not some of what he says is true is, I guess, beside the point.

• I have no strong opinion on whether the authors should do or even could do a study of ethical dilemmas facing cryptographers in the job market. But I do have a serious disagreement with the claim in 1.1 that ""cryptographic research should not be used to satisfy the trade secret clauses in nondisclosure agreements.""

1) A lot of the mathematics used in cryptography (such as Shamir's secret sharing scheme) has substantial applications outside of cryptography. Even when the mathematics of cryptography itself is used in business, for instance during the Enron incident, it would be odd to regard the needs of the business ""owner"" as taking precedence over a need for academic freedom.

2) For many kinds of cryptography (e.g. financial cryptography) it would be irrational for",534,4,2508

It has served as a way for people to explore and express their emotions, tell stories, and entertain others. From the very beginning, theater has evolved and changed over time, but one thing remains constant: theater continues to bring people together and leave a lasting impact on their lives.

Ancient Greece:
Theater in ancient Greece was seen as a form of ritualistic worship. It was believed to be a way for people to connect with the gods and goddesses, and to share in a common cultural experience. Greek theater featured plays that often had a moral or religious message, and they were performed outdoors in large open-air theaters.

Roman theater:
Roman theater was similar to Greek theater, but it was more focused on entertainment and less on religious rituals. Roman theater featured comedies and tragedies, and actors were often appreciated for their comedic timing and acting abilities.

Medieval Europe:
During the Middle Ages, theater took a more religious tone. Christian plays were performed throughout Europe, with themes such as salvation and repentance. These plays often took place in small, intimate spaces and were meant to inspire people to live virtuous lives.

Renaissance Europe:
The Renaissance brought a renewed interest in theater and a renewed emphasis on humanism. This led to the development of new plays and new forms of theater. The 16th century saw the emergence of the “Commedia dell’arte,” a form of improvisational theater that featured stock characters such as Harlequin and Columbine.

The Baroque period:
The Baroque period in Europe was marked by grandeur and extravagance. Theater during this time was often done on a larger scale, with elaborate sets and costumes. Baroque theater was also marked by a focus on emotion and drama, with plays often featuring tragic or romantic themes.

The Enlightenment:
During the Enlightenment, theater became more focused on reason and logic. The emphasis on logic led to new forms of theater, such as the play “The Dying Gaul” by Marivaux, which was a more naturalistic representation of life and relationships.

Modern times:
The 20th century saw the emergence of new forms of theater, such as the clowning and physical theater of Jerzy Grotowski, and the absurdist plays of Samuel Beckett. In recent years, theater has become more experimental and diverse, with theaters around the world showcasing new and innovative forms of theater.

As chemical and computing technology continue to converge and mature, the implications of our integrated world are becoming increasingly apparent. Harnessing the power of computational simulation to accelerate our understanding of synthetic and biological processes and quantum advances to further our analysis and control of matter offer tremendous opportunities. Transformative advances may one day impact our life and work, helping to satisfy greater demands for clean, abundant energy; improving our capacity to respond to global climate change and environmental challenges; and modifying our bodies for better human health. There are, however, serious roadblocks to realizing the full potential of computing and simulation. One such roadblock is chemistry’s robust nature – with thousands of unique compounds possessing unique structures and properties. Computer simulation has matured from the simple molecular mechanics methods of the 1960s to new quantum computational approaches capable of handling the accurate description of tens of thousands of atoms and molecular orbitals. It is clear that tools are needed that can discover and virtualize chemical compounds over wide ranges of choices in structural and energetic criteria. Furthermore, our current computational approaches, much like our current computational mechanics, will be hard pressed to meet the demands of thousands of different reaction pathways with computational time and storage at a reasonable cost. Thankfully, the power of evolution and machine learning provides exciting new approaches to addressing these problems.

We do not know how our brains work, and not really why we do what we do, there is a dearth of knowledge about neural development and plasticity, particularly about the brain’s brain, the neocortex, and its functioning when well. Neuroscience now appears to be at a critical juncture. There has been an explosion of data, but the neuroscientist’s conceptual framework still has much in common with that of the 1950s. As a result, the tools that have been developed for processing and interpreting this massive body of new data remain rather limited.
In a new book ‘The Master and His Emissary’ Iain has argued that the right hemisphere is the theatre of consciousness. The left hemisphere is a more passive processor, storing and processing information, according to Iain. It is more time consuming, and a more protracted processing, and is better at abstract thinking. The two hemispheres are in communication with one another. This blog describes some of the philosophy behind Iain’s book. Here is the link to the blog: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/14/mcgilchrist-book.
At its best, philosophy also has the ‘feel’ of science. And it is the aim of the Symposium on Philosophy to show the interface between philosophy and science, and how these two disciplines work together to augment our knowledge of reality.
Andrew J.Cole is Senior Research Scholar in the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at Stanford University. His book ‘Writing and Reason’ is based on his time studying at the Sorbonne, where a lot of core philosophical issues are re-examined with a new focus on the relationship between writing and critical thinking. Cole has presented various versions of his thesis at Stanford and has an excellent blog on writing and thinking.
The program opens with the talk by Professor Frank Jackson on ‘What is analyticity?’, he is a widely respected philosopher and logician who spent most of his career in Australia. His work has been described by philosopher and logician David Lewis as ‘an artistic tour de force.’ Frank has written a book on the subject ‘Epistemic Modality’, which is just the first in a series of three. For these talks Frank has been working with philosopher Shane Austin who is going to open the second day of the Symposium, his speciality is the philosophy of language",508,4,2411
599,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", art, and musical composition has mirrored societal changes and has often preceded them. There is a hierarchy of advancement in the arts in relation to societal evolution. The visual arts are considered the highest forms of expression with literature, music, dance, and theatre being well behind them. There is a natural progression of sophistication, complexity, and discipline in all of these forms. Society develops its standards over time and as greater awareness of quality is attained, the form must follow in order to keep in step with social evolution. There will always be a few artists that lead the charge, that separate themselves from the normal force, leading the way toward new modes of expression.
Certain movements in literature, art, and music mirror the psychology of man. There was a well established system of political and social structure and expression during the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Romantic eras. The ability of the individual to express himself was determined by his family status, accomplishments, and property. Their role was defined for them and they occupied a very specific place in society. The transfer to capitalistic societies and the rise of individualism was much more rapid than the evolution of art and became, for the most part, a reflection of this rapid social evolution. There was a great release in individualism and emotion was experienced to a much higher degree than it had before. As individuals more boldly and explicitly expressed themselves, art began to become more artistic. Literature, music, and visual art began to be created for the sake of the creation and not primarily for the purpose of social expression. During the later half of the 20th century, the basic structures of Western life collapsed and individuals placed less emphasis on the social order and more of a focus on their own individualistic needs. This has continued through this century to date.
In 1873, French literary critic Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867) writes ""L'Art dans tous ses états."" (""Art in all its states""). This was a culmination of his journey and search for creative expression after having moved away from Romanticism. He was disgusted by the effects of Romanticism and what he observed was that it replaced abstract emotion, with vivid emotion. The artistic pursuit of Romanticism began to become overwrought with self indulgent sentimentality and flowery descriptions. Baudelaire rejected emotional expression as being unimportant or the surface view of things. It was too highly influenced by the world around it and did not transcend it. He felt it was insufficient and could be creatively",516,4,2646

The history of medicine dates back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China, where healers and priests were entrusted with the responsibility of treating the sick and injured. The techniques used in these early medical practices were mainly based on observation and superstition, and often involved the use of natural remedies such as herbs and plants.

During the Middle Ages, medicine was still largely unscientific, and many diseases were seen as the work of evil spirits or curses. Physicians and herbalists were still prevalent, but surgery was often performed without anesthesia or proper disinfection, leading to high mortality rates.

During the Renaissance, a more scientific approach to medicine began to emerge, with the introduction of new techniques such as bloodletting and the use of pharmaceuticals. However, these methods were still largely unproven, and many believed that they were of little use in the treatment of many illnesses.

In the 19th century, the use of antibiotics and vaccines revolutionized medicine, leading to significant improvements in public health. The rise of modern medicine was also marked by the development of many new medical technologies such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI machines.

Today, medicine has advanced to the point where many new treatments and cures are being developed regularly. Advances in medical research have allowed scientists to understand many of the mechanisms behind diseases, and to create treatments that can help patients live longer and healthier lives. The focus on personalized medicine and genetic engineering is also revolutionizing the field of medicine, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of illnesses.

In conclusion, medicine has evolved over time to become a highly advanced field of science, driven by new technologies and innovations. While there is still much to be learned about the human body and how it functions, the advancements that have been made in recent years have had a profound impact on the way we treat illness and improve health outcomes.

Can you give an example of a new medical treatment that has been developed recently?

Sure, one example of a new medical treatment that has been developed recently is gene therapy. Gene therapy is a type of treatment that involves using a patient's own cells to treat or even cure genetic disorders. The procedure involves taking a patient's cells, modifying them in a laboratory to correct the genetic defect causing the disorder, and then reinserting the modified cells into the patient. This process is still in the early stages of development, but researchers have made significant progress in recent years, and there have been promising results in clinical trials for several genetic disorders.",519,4,2808

It might just be because we are a long way from Christmas, but for me it is a clear indication that there are a lot of businesses out there, still using outdated methods to research their customers.
Based on a number of client conversations over the last month, and 3 years of talking to a variety of psychometric test companies, I’ve come up with a theory that psychometric testing and research has a real “nice-to-have” air about it and not a “must-have” air about it.
One of the questions we were asked recently on a test we completed was whether we could multi-task. It seems such an innocuous question but there are companies out there who claim their tests can go through hundreds of these types of questions in a day.
I was very taken by a quote I read recently about research that it needs to be done properly and only the researchers that have no other agenda can justify spending the time and money to do a quality research piece.
There are many us out there who just have too much time on our hands and have a strong preference for experience rather than research. It seems such a sound idea, surely it is true and therefore results are based on solid information rather than just gut instinct. Why do we spend so much time talking about gut instinct rather than being honest and saying “we don’t really know”. We are all familiar with the interesting times we live in and recent experiences around the world have not exactly helped.
I think the most prevalent misconception is that psychometric testing is a “nice to have”, I just don’t think it is a nice-to-have, I think it is a must-have. The only area in which this is not true is where the “average” manager or leader is concerned, but given that psychometric testing is predicted to grow year on year, there can’t be a large number of managers and leaders out there who don’t need the ongoing benefit of psychometric testing.
Another issue is how it is rolled out. Any manager that says that “he/she” got a special test to tell them how to manage, is likely to be down the employment market way before Christmas. Results in from psychological assessments can’t be written on a sticker and people need to know it is a process and take time.

With the theme “Transform”, FIC 2018 aims to inspire audience to think differently to create a sustainable future, taking art and design from museum walls to the market, imagination to practice, passion to profession.
As part of FIC, a special exhibition titled Eye O on Transculturalism will be unveiled at National Gallery Singapore. This exhibition takes a playful look at the ways in which creative imagination and creative translocalism drive and shape the practice of three Singaporean artists – Marina Benjamin, Sufiean Zulkifli and Tan Xiao Hui. The exhibition will explore how multi-layered cultural influences feed into the diverse practices of these artists. The Eye O on Transculturalism exhibition will be open to the public from 12 to 15 July 2018.
- How do we creatively explore and interpret our cultural roots and transform them in a creative way? How can we creatively engage audiences through a mix of traditional and contemporary art forms to facilitate learning? The number of new multimedia techniques, formats and devices for interactive and participatory experiences are on the rise and what we have today are not limited to just the play of lights and sounds. Technology is enhancing learning and knowledge sharing in education, empowering students to design, learn and gain firsthand experience while excelling at what they do. With art and design helping to cultivate critical and independent thinking and creative solutions to deal with global societal problems, the FIC is a great platform for students and educators to bring ideas and creativity to life.

This helps to provide markets and stall owners with information and also provide access to promote events and programmes within the markets by “pushing” specific videos and information to the mobile market using QR codes. “It is a great innovation project to be part of, as it truly impacts the community directly,” said Carissa Kek, Program Coordinator (Arts Management), SMU.

As such, to discuss these topics meaningfully, we need to step back and understand what cryptography is and how it works. Our discussion today will be strictly theoretical, but as we learn about the past, we will also talk about its immediate future. Cryptography is how we keep information secure in the digital age. Without cryptography, we wouldn't be able to deal with confidential communications, computers in all their shapes and sizes, secure medical records, or anything else that requires you to keep your information private.
Very often, these communications have to be done in a way that no one can intercept them. This is no easy task, and it requires that we use highly specialized techniques to both encipher, or scramble up the information we want to transmit, as well as decipher it again once it has reached its destination.
At BWC, we believe that software development needs to be very focused on improving user interaction, which is why we are interested in improving the overall user experience. In particular, we are interested in providing users with the ability to securely and privately conduct transactions over the internet using the software development process. One of our first steps will be using cryptographic techniques to help users keep their private keys separate from the other information that is stored on their computer.
So why do we care about the relationship between cryptography and technology? The technological innovations and breakthroughs that we take for granted today were made possible by the unceasing efforts of a series of brilliant minds. From the creation of the electric lamp to the establishment of the world wide web, technology has been growing, taking leaps of incredible breadth and depth. Consider the technology of cryptography -- it enables secure communications by keeping sensitive information out of the hands of someone that is not allowed to access it.
As we move through the history of cryptography, we will discuss the individuals that were at the cutting edge of the field. These individuals should serve as a reminder that every technological marvel was once the dream of a single mind. In the very near future, we intend to continue studying and better understanding cryptography, and how it relates to the cutting edge technologies of the digital age.",477,4,2533

Writing a cipher (encryption algorithm) can be a simple undertaking with a few mathematical components involved. However, writing a secure cipher requires sophisticated mathematics and complex algorithms to be effective. That’s where ICH1 starts.

Please note that what we are trying to implement is a vector of AES, SHA-2, Rijndael, and Serpent ciphers that use the Double Ratchet algorithm to provide security at every level of the communication. This includes within the application, the VPN connection, and the Internet connection. Some level of advanced coding is required to provide the proper implementation of the protocol.

The first phase of development will begin with the requirements phase and work through design, architecture, implementation, and validation. This phase will develop all the logic, tests, and components and should take approximately six months to accomplish. Design and Implementation are completed by Bill Spencer while design and architecture are completed by Randy Smith. After the application is created, the communication protocol, the network, and the Internet will be connected and tested with specialized tools, and with DNS Level 2 checks to see if the application is being successfully run.

The next phase will be a period of corrections and testing to ensure the protocol is both well architected and tested. This will involve vetting the software with advanced developers to provide feedback and (hopefully) correction. This phase will take four months.

At this time, a second security function can be incorporated, which is the ability to audit traffic on the link between the app and the VPN. This will reveal the nature of communication between the people who are communicating. This will allow an outside party to see who is talking to whom, and what they are saying to each other. In this case the security factor is removed because the communication between the people who are talking to each other will be visible. This allows a third party to see the conversation. However, if we consider that the link is public, the encryption should not be broken. This can be a deterrent for bad actors who would attempt to intercept the communication but would not be able to read it or hack it. This type of communication is safe from surveillance and intrusion.

The final phase will be to implement the feedback control layer to regulate the traffic of communications. If an application is used on a computer with a secure firewall, the results of what is seen can be blocked. This requires some specialized coding of the firewall that is likely beyond our abilities. With this type of effort, we hope to provide our",502,4,2664

Broadly, there are two schools of thought regarding historical geology. There is plate tectonics and there is catastrophism. The latter was the predominant theory until the 1970s and early 1980s. This was the era of the great ‘drainage set’. Due to its apparent success, they became almost paradigmatic, and gradually became the accepted dogma. If it does not fit with what they are actually saying, then we ought to ask what the implications are for this theory, and how might we test it?

If Plate Tectonics is correct, what does that mean that the majority of historical geology has been based on? This has been the mainstream view of geology until relatively recently, and even now is largely the view of the vast majority of geologists. Should the majority of geology be found wanting in the face of seemingly indisputable evidence, the whole of our understanding of the earth will have to be reconsidered. A few people will not be able to live with that thought.

There is one school of geology which claims that Plate Tectonics is too simplified a model to describe the whole of the earth's history, a school which is now increasingly accepted. It is the school of historical geology. From that perspective, the fossil record provides evidence not only of mass extinctions, but also evidence that these large tectonic plates are not static and in fact seems to suggest they may actually be ‘folding’ back upon each other, that is, pushing up under the other. We have to be aware of this when we attempt to reconstruct history and if catastrophism is true, then it suggests that the geologic record is even more chaotic than even those with Plate Tectonics have imagined.

It is the opposite of the ‘plate tectonic’ view of the earth's past. It is that the earth's history is full of catastrophes, caused by asteroid and cometary bombardment, by tectonic stretching, then shrinkage, driven by the lack of water, and by volcanic activity, in particular mountain building events. These would be catastrophes that will change all of the geologic layers, to some degree or other. For large scale mountain building events, the surface geology that we observe today would be totally unrecognisable; hence the rapid changes to the geology of the Earth's surface.

Cinema is an art form that has been around for over a century, but it is constantly evolving and changing with technology. The history of cinema dates back to the late 19th century when the first experimental film was created by Louis Le Prince in France.

In the early years, cinema was seen as a novelty, and it was primarily used for entertainment and amusement. However, as technology improved, filmmakers began to experiment with new techniques and storytelling methods.

In the early 1900s, the industry began to grow rapidly, with major studios such as MGM and Warner Bros. emerging. The silent era saw some of the most influential films in history, including Charlie Chaplin's ""The Gold Rush"" and ""The Kid.""

The advent of sound in cinema in the late 1920s transformed the industry and opened up new possibilities for storytelling. The Great Depression in the 1930s led to the creation of some of the most iconic movies of all time, including ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Casablanca,"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""

During World War II, cinema continued to thrive, and films such as ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and ""Citizen Kane"" became critical and commercial successes. In the 1950s, the industry saw a shift to more family-friendly fare, with movies such as ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Singin' in the Rain.""

In the 1960s, the youth culture movement led to a new wave of films that dealt with social issues and challenged traditional values. The rise of independent cinema in the 1970s saw filmmakers push the boundaries of storytelling and use cinema to explore controversial themes.

The 1980s saw the emergence of the blockbuster era, with movies such as ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" and ""Back to the Future"" becoming cultural phenomena. In the 1990s, the rise of the internet and digital technology led to new possibilities for storytelling and experimentation.

In recent years, cinema has become more diverse and inclusive, with films such as ""Get Out"" and ""Moonlight"" breaking barriers and pushing for greater representation onscreen. Cinema remains an important cultural institution, with its films reflecting the hopes, dreams, and struggles of people across the world.

Robots were no longer just for factory work or military purposes, they were now being used in countless industries and even in people's homes.

At first, some were skeptical about the impact of robots on society. Would they take away jobs from humans? Would they become too powerful and dangerous? However, as time went on, people began to see the benefits of robots in their daily lives.

In the medical field, robots were used to assist with surgeries and other procedures. They could perform tasks with greater precision and accuracy than humans, reducing the risk of errors and complications. This led to faster recovery times and better patient outcomes.

In the manufacturing industry, robots were used to increase efficiency and reduce costs. They could work around the clock without needing breaks or sleep, and could assemble products faster and more accurately than human workers. This led to a boost in productivity and allowed companies to produce more goods at lower prices.

In the home, robots were used for tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and even caregiving for the elderly and disabled. They could perform these tasks with greater speed and efficiency than humans, freeing up time for people to focus on other aspects of their lives.

However, as robotics became more advanced and ubiquitous in society, some began to worry about the impact on employment. Would robots replace human workers altogether? Would they lead to a widening income gap between those who had access to the latest technologies and those who did not?

Despite these concerns, the benefits of robotics were undeniable. They allowed people to work smarter, live better, and achieve greater success. And so, robotics continued to play an ever-increasing role in society, shaping the future in ways that were once unimaginable.

What are some of the challenges that need to be addressed in developing more advanced robots? Developing more advanced robots involves overcoming a number of challenges. Some of these challenges are:

1. Cost: The cost of developing and producing advanced robots is relatively high. There is a need to find ways to make the manufacturing process more cost-effective.

2. Safety: Robots need to be designed with safety in mind. This includes protecting against potential hazards, such as collisions or electrical shocks.

3. Mobility: Developing robots that can move around and interact with their environment is a significant challenge. This requires advanced sensors, cameras, and other technologies.

We know that whatever we see has been filtered, distorted, enhanced, ruined, by the photographer’s perception of reality. Yet we accept a postcard as a quick and cheap representation of the reality we desire.
The Met museum’s latest exhibition, Attitudes at a Distance: Egyptian Portraits in the Collection of Michel A.W. Parsons, consists of mainly a diverse series of modest-scale photographs by the French photographer Robert Paradell – ranging from landscape and still-life to portraits. The portraits are of Berber and other desert-dwelling people of Egypt’s Western Desert, using the older photographic ‘wet-collodion’ process; perhaps the only surviving photographic medium in existence. The presence of the environment is felt just as strongly as the people – perhaps even more so – though the surface of the glass plate contains a coating of moonlight, mainly a creaminess due to the subject’s face and any bright light casting a reflection. Despite being dated, the photography feels so contemporaneous with the high speed and manipulation we see daily in the age of digital, post-photographic painting and sculpture, and does so in a way which dissects the idea of the photographic image even further.
For example, the photo ‘Portrait of the Woman Younis, Gholam Mahmoud’ – a woman of the Fayoum Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert – displays a striking double-blind effect. First, there is the interpretation of the subject as a young lady; the light with which it is shot ideal to accentuate her skin. However, this light isn’t likely to fall on any individual face in such a shape without the perspective of such an eye in the frame. And is the headshot being shot at a slant, down toward the viewer? How does this relation correspond to the surrounding landscape and perhaps other spectators? The double-blinding, whether intentional or not, is less about reality and more about the photographer’s perception, which in turn has a relationship with the camera’s lens and film (both also partially reflective).
Or in ‘The Old Teacher’. In this case, the lens shifts from focalized on the subject (they are not looking directly at the camera) to focussing on a background panorama without a single feature of the foreground, the former cast to edge of the frame – again with the idea of a camera out in the desert, possibly just beyond the edges of the frame – on an otherwise uncharacterized",524,4,2520

Can you give me an example of a chemical reaction and how it works? Sure, a chemical reaction is when two or more substances combine to form new substances. For example, when we burn wood, a chemical reaction takes place where the wood is broken down into its constituent elements - carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen - and combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, water, and ash. This reaction is commonly referred to as combustion. The energy released during this reaction is what powers many devices and is one of the primary reasons for air pollution.

Can you explain how enzymes work in chemical reactions? Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in chemical reactions. They speed up the reaction by providing a more favorable energy profile for the reaction to occur. Enzymes bind to specific substrates and alter their structure to make them more reactive. This is because enzymes can increase the reactivity of substrates by stabilizing the transition state, which is the species between reactants and products. Enzymes can also increase the rate of a reaction by reducing the activation energy, which is the energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to occur. As a result, enzymes play a critical role in many biochemical processes and are essential for life.

Can you give me an example of a substrate that can be acted upon by enzymes? Sure, one example of a substrate that can be acted upon by enzymes is glucose. Glucose is a simple sugar that is the primary source of energy for living organisms. Enzymes such as glucose oxidase and hexokinase can act upon glucose to convert it into other useful forms, such as ATP and pyruvate. These enzymes help to regulate the metabolism of glucose and ensure that living organisms are able to obtain the energy they need to function.

Can you explain how enzymes differ from catalysts in chemical reactions? Enzymes and catalysts are both substances that speed up chemical reactions, but they differ in several key ways. Catalysts do not have any specific structure or shape, meaning that they can come in various forms and do not have any specific interaction with the substrate. Catalysts only increase the reaction rate by lowering the energy required to initiate a reaction. Enzymes, on the other hand, are specific to certain types of reactions and are organized into a three-dimensional structure that allows them to bind to their substr",504,4,2637

Bring yourself up to speed with RAC-103 – One of the highly requested IBM course is finally being offered. Given that I am one of the few people who have taken this course, I thought I should pen my experiences on here.

The instructor was smart and brought quite a few examples to the students to dig into at different points during the course. The size of the class was just right for this type of course, around 20 students.

The instructor was very helpful. A lot of information in RAC-103 is left for students to explore themselves and figure out how things work, whether by reading the material or through research. The instructor would make himself available to talk with students to help them work out their own solutions, to summarize, if students ask questions directly during the time allotted for the hands-on session, or when they email him after class.

The worst part of the course is that I am very busy and do not always have time to do the extra practice. I have a couple of more days until the course ends and I still need to complete more coding exercises. I have a more intense schedule for the next few weeks which will be very busy. Despite the busy schedule, I hope to get as much practice done before the end of the course to prepare for the final exam.

622,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," reveals a particularly fascinating area of weather: thunderstorms. It is part of most people's daily life and by now we have all experienced some form of a thunderstorm, even if we were unaware of it at the time. In fact, thunderstorms have a major impact on the weather, with the most devastating instances resulting in large amounts of destruction. So what exactly are thunderstorms?
How are thunderstorms formed?
A thunderstorm is caused by the widespread movement of air from low pressure to high pressure. This can occur when two air masses of differing temperature, humidity, and/or wind move against each other. The rising air will begin to cool by condensation and start to rise into the colder air above it. The rising air will continue to lift until eventually, it runs into a barrier of cold air, which will result in a forming thunderstorm cloud. When lightning strikes, the air is then warmed by the heat that is generated, and the cloud is known as a thunderstorm cloud.
Cloud types that are associated with thunderstorms are cumulonimbus, cumulus and cumulus congestus. Cumulonimbus are large towers of cloud that are the most common and most threatening form. Cumulus are little to no towers of cloud but can gather together and build to a cumulonimbus. Cumulus congestus are smaller and denser but also result in lightning and thunder.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), nearly 50 million people in the U.S. are susceptible to a thunderstorm-related incident each year. At least half a million people have been evacuated due to dangerous weather in the past decade. So what do people need to know to keep safe?
The most important piece of advice is to avoid being outside during a thunderstorm. Thunderstorms typically occur between late afternoon and nighttime. It is important to remember that thunder is the sound of lightning and if you can hear thunder, it is possible to be struck by lightning. Lightning can strike and kill you miles away from a storm.
An alternate method of protection is to seek shelter. NOAA recommends looking out for a durable, sturdy building like a house. Make sure to avoid any metalic equipment such as bicycles, golf clubs and cell phones.
If shelter is not available, consider looking for a tree and climbing to the top, as they are great conductors of electricity. Avoid standing near water and if swimming, get out as soon as possible.

The Mythbusters have demonstrated just how deadly this proposition is, but there's more to it than simply keeping the chip to the outer, stovetop safe. A stove top can be a dangerous place, and it's not just because of boiling water. The Mythbusters were working under the preconceived notion that the main problem was getting steam burns; using a grate on top of a stove is yet another means by which a stove becomes a weapon. I'll show you how it works and why it's dangerous.
In the latest iteration of his series on cooking, Corrie M. Vance calls the mythos ""don't crack it on the stovetop"" as though it were a platitude, and notes that there are three differences between this ""safe food form"" and one that's still raw. One, obviously, is the fact that a wet form is heated on one surface, but a dry form is heated on another. But that leaves the other two unstated, so I have, and they're not the same for wet food and dried food. For starters, the span is much wider when it's a wet form, which leads to the second difference. Even when the span is the same, the distribution of heat is different. Wet foods tend to have more surface area compared with dried foods, and the difference is a consequence of compression during drying. If you remember, the loss of volume means the surface area per unit of mass is greater in the dried food. Therefore, it absorbs more heat and cooks faster and more evenly than it would have if it were alive.
More importantly, here's why it's unsafe to use your stove top to cook in dry food form. The first is moisture. There's a lot of it in food; the more water you've got in it, the more energy you need to absorb. Dry food, having absorbed none, doesn't know that it will have more energy than it did before. Dry food is invisible. You can't tell where the heat has already gone, and how hot the surface will become. This makes it hard to tell when you've reached your limit. A surface that's perfectly safe at the beginning of cooking will cook in dry food form all of the way up to its top temperature.
That's not the worst part. When you get closer to it, you'll also notice that the normal temperature range narrows. So you won't need to go past it.",538,4,2273

## Introduction

In Part 1 and Part 2 of this series we explored the capabilities of individual random forests. We discovered how highly customizable, flexible, and powerful random forests are. We also learned the concept of Random Forest Aggregation Method which is being presented here.

Before we get into the details of RFM, we are going to attempt to learn about various metrics that a random forest can produce.

## Generic RFM

First, let us consider a scenario where we are building a single random forest for classification task. In this case, the RFM will be: ‘class Prediction’, ‘weight of evidence’, and ‘prediction confidence’.

• Class Prediction: this means the probability of one class over another. It is the main classification that the algorithm tries to predict. This is also known as the Post Decision Function (PDF).
• Weight of Evidence (WOE) :This is a measure of the relative importance of a particular category, in comparison to all others. It is also the normalized entropy of the target vector, where target vector contains all categories in the target variable. Essentially, it tries to measure how important a feature vector is with respect to the prediction target.
• Prediction Confidence (PC): this means the possibility of the model making the correct prediction (True positive and true negative). A machine learning model with higher PC value is more confident in making correct predictions.

Once we have these values for RFM, we could evaluate a single random forest as follows:
Figure 1: RFM Diagram

In order to learn how RFM varies from one random forest to another, let’s take a look at Figure 2.

Figure 2: RFM Variation with more trees

The above figure was created after performing random forests with a large number of trees and trying to see the corresponding variation.

## Graphical Representation of RFM

Figure 3: Random Forest Characteristic or RGFC

• RFM Variable Vectors: These variables are the basis of graphical representations of RFM.

625,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," shows that the punch-like speed of a sound wave can't be limited by its compression to a cube.
We have all experienced various forms of the sound wave: from the moment the sound travels all the way from the 4-inch speaker to your ear to the sense of acceleration experienced by your eardrum at the onset of a gunshot. Sound waves can travel, and they are capable of attacking at high speeds. However, if we consider the speed of a compression wave as having a fundamental limit, that speed must be limited to some cubic length, like the size of a 4-inch speaker or your head. Are there any sound waves that propagate at speeds exceeding this “effective speed limit”? And is there a fundamental limit on how fast compression waves can get in this regard?
The compressive wave amplitude increases as the waves propagate from the source. In some situations, two small areas on the wave’s surface, known as nodes, do not oscillate at all. However, it is not the distance between nodes which determines the wave speed. Instead, it is the speed of the wave itself as it passes through nodes, through a process known as refractive index. This speed changes as the wave passes through different materials; for example, the speed of the wave of sound generated by a tuning fork can reach 343 m/s (a rare-earth materials as opposed to a steel valve). This is, however, quite far from the speed of light, which is much higher and, for instance, prevents information transmission through a vacuum (or air). To be fair, air, although a poor choice as a medium for sound waves, is only a poor medium at vacuum-level conditions.
Speaking of good mediums for sound waves, water would have been a perfect one, until some geese came. You’ve probably already made the connection, but here it is: the speed of sound in water and the way it propels fish and birds are two closely related concepts. You can see the direct dependence between the wave’s speed and the water’s density in the picture on the right. Let’s say, you are not at all a physicist, and you want to have fun instead. How can you make sound waves faster than the speed of 1480 m/s at vacuum-level conditions? After some thinking, you conclude that if you decrease the wavelength, your sound wave will reach more points in a given time, and thus, its speed will be higher.
As you can see, the wavelength, i.e. the distance between nodes, only",527,4,2390

NOTE: This article is an excerpt from Engineering History written by David A. Levinson in 1973. The complete book can be purchased HERE.
There was no periodical devoted entirely to all forms of engineering in 1800. Scanty references to the magazine trade during this first quarter century confirm this, but it can be presumed that, since all manners of retail outlets for publications were then in being, whether books, pamphlets, periodicals or newspapers, these printed products were published in the most readily available quantities for sale or loaning in the publishing trade. But the available information confirms that there were certainly no engineering periodicals at that time.
To some degree, from about 1800, the engineering craft was still essentially a small business enterprise, the performance of its work being supervised by a master working in a shop or workshop where apprentices were trained in the principal engineering disciplines, metallurgy, carpentry, and smithery. This prevailing condition did not last long; in the first half of the nineteenth century this apprentice system gave way to a steadily growing school, college and university system for the education of the working people who would become full-fledged professional engineers. In conjunction with this expansion of the educational process, the mechanical arts too were undergoing a degree of formal and formalistic professionalization. Indeed, engineering was being redefined by the mid 1800’s.
Leonard Sibree in The Book of the Ironworkers, 1871, describes the development of professional engineering in England in the years between 1760 and 1870:
“When our fathers brought in the iron fittings, standards, columns, and crutches to support the girders, they had no national or municipal, no university or body of theoretical or practical engineers. Nature afforded no provincial classifications of titles or grades. The industry of the mill and foundry, the navigation of the sea, the gigantic project of building the Britania, and all other departments of civilization owed their organization and classification to the spirit of practical invention and enterprise of men singularly their own. Few words had any definite relation to their exact mechanical application; few manufactures were ever advertised by names.”
To make a complete transition from individual practice to professional engineering services, a systematic and professional professional structure for engineering was developed. Since there were no comprehensive engineering organizations at this time (the two organizations founded in 1818 were",478,4,2658

When I was taking a course in atomic structure and quantum mechanics, a version of the wave-particle duality came up. It took me a long while to wrap my mind around it, so I thought I’d share my experience.
The wave-particle duality allows us to think of atoms and particles from a classical point of view. It is that we can observe a particle from a classical perspective if we send light or other kind of radiation to it. We can think of this as a cloud, that just happens to move as a particle. Note that we can observe electrons as particles or as waves, there is no preferred perspective. But in both cases we are observing the particle from the classical perspective.
Now this, up to a certain point, was relatively intuitive, if you are familiar with the classical analogs. The above “cloud” can appear to us as waves in the same way that water becomes a wave when disturbed. The electrons have their influence over this wave in a very similar way to the way in which waves in water are affected by an object in the water. Here is where it gets tricky. If we do the experiments, as we are used to do when we observe particles, we observe the particles. Here I want to pause and think about what exactly we observe. If we send the radiation and we have a detector outside the cloud, we can see the particle. This is called the double slit experiment (Image 1). If we see the particle there, then in some way we can consider ourselves looking at it like we would look at a lump of water. We are, although we consider particles to be waves and water waves to be particles. Of course, in this case we are observing something that is in some way discrete and finite, but the overall shape of the wave, the particles, is not something that will show up clearly in a detector. But if we take the example of an electron beam, if we fire the electron beam at a target we can see the result, a bunch of dots, or another example, a cloud on a flat surface of paint, show up, and in both cases we can think of the electron beam as something distributed all over the target. A cloud can easily get spread over a flat surface and seems like a good example to describe the electron beam. The dots of the electron beam are there for sure, even though the picture seems to highlight the electron beam.
With this observation in mind, let’s take the total view that the electron beam is a cloud and that the",513,4,2396

Poetry has been an integral part of human expression since the dawn of civilization. Its roots can be traced back to ancient Greece, where poets were often hailed as the voice of the gods and were seen as having a divine right to speak the truth.

In ancient Greece, poetry was the primary means of communicating important ideas and values. The famous poet Homer is believed to have written the epic poems ""The Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey"" during the 8th century BC. These works not only told epic stories of heroes and gods but also contained significant moral and philosophical teachings.

During the Renaissance, poetry saw a resurgence in Europe with the works of poets such as Petrarch, Dante, and Boccaccio. Renaissance poetry emphasized the beauty of language and the importance of emotional expression. The metaphysical poets, including John Donne and George Herbert, also made significant contributions during this period.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, poetry underwent a transformation as Romanticism emerged in Europe. This movement emphasized individuality, emotion, and imagination. Poets such as William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and John Keats championed a new style of poetry known as Romanticism.

In the 20th century, poetry became more experimental and diverse, with movements such as Modernism, Surrealism, and Beat poetry challenging traditional norms. Poets such as T.S. Eliot, Sylvia Plath, and Allen Ginsberg used poetry as a form of social commentary and explored new techniques and styles.

In modern times, poetry continues to evolve and adapt to new forms of expression. With the rise of social media and online platforms, poets now have new avenues to share their work and connect with readers from all over the world. Additionally, contemporary poets are exploring topics such as identity, politics, and technology in their work.

This is great! Can you add more information about how different cultures around the world have contributed to the history of poetry?

Certainly! Different cultures around the world have made significant contributions to the history of poetry and have helped shape the way we understand and appreciate poetry today.

In Asia, poetry has a long and rich history, with classical Chinese poetry being one of the oldest forms of literature in the world. Chinese poetry emphasizes the beauty and complexity of language, often using riddles, metaphors, and allusions to create meaning. Famous Chinese poets include Li Bai, Du Fu, and Li Qingzhao.

The vestibular system in the inner ear, one of the most important parts of our physical sensors, plays a crucial role in how we detect movement, balance, stability, and orientation (Puma et al, 2006). Since our DNA knows how to transmit signals that maintain this balance, that makes us inherently capable of moving in various fashions. 

Question: How do we know how to dance?
We know how to dance because the vestibular system in the inner ear is one of the most important parts of our physical sensors and plays a crucial role in how we detect movement, balance, stability, and orientation[1]. Our DNA knows how to transmit signals that maintain balance, which is necessary in order to dance[1].

635,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," runways are many in number, and I bet you have heard or even possibly believed them yourself. So I would like to take you through some of the most common myths about what goes on backstage during fashion shows, as well as debunk some of the more common misconceptions.
Having worked on a wide array of fashion shows, ranging from small names up to big players such as Calvin Klein, Mugler, Macy’s or Ovadia & Sons, I have picked up bits and pieces of knowledge about the ins-and-outs of the industry. Sure, everyone has heard of the models jumping into puddles, shoe-print chaos and screaming over loud music but here is an even deeper look into how some of the bigger things work.
Don’t get me wrong, we as show organizers put on a full show for the audience but sometimes “the press” is invited too. This means that some designers choose not to go “full show”, and instead want to surprise and get more coverage in the media.
Big names have full shows, but small designers try to keep it hush-hush and more intimate. It happens. Sure, there is a bit of drama because of the judgement but trust me when I say it is as healthy as it is necessary. And we also have a little bit of drama off-stage as well, but if your sole objective as an audience member is to see what “the models have been doing” just go out to the nearest grocery store and you’ll be swamped with images within seconds.
The big names are comfortable with the media being in their show and it makes sense as the exposure is great. It has helped to revitalize and build buzz around smaller designers as well by creating a hype before and after the shows are over. Think of it as a spillover of positive media attention, which in this day and age can be a godsend to any designer or artist.
From the backstage pass security personnel, to the helpers and show organizers, everyone is constantly on the move, either directing the models, hair and make-up staff or dealing with models backstage.
The show room is a bustling space full of friends, media and people I could not even begin to tell you who they are. And mind you, this is backstage in the American sense of the word and not in the Parisian sense where a makeup artist and a stylist sits with the models while the models wait for the show to begin.

Jane Austen (1775-1817) was a particularly good example of the Romantic philosophy of education, known as the seven perfect social classes—superior, second class, third class, fourth class, fifth class, sixth class, and seventh class.
Jane’s father Edward was a Gentleman and so they were a superior social class. Her mother’s name was Cassandra, and although she was much more class-conscious than her father, she didn’t think she belonged to the Superiors. Most of Jane’s brothers married for Superiors and most of her sisters married for Primals—anything lower than a third. Well, Jane fell in love with the man who was an ‘indifferent’ or a third class. Jane’s letters about Mr. Leighs who was a friend of her sister have revealed that he was not good enough to be a Primals and was an exception to the perfect social class. Mr. Leigh gave Jane Austen’s sister a ‘blow with a glove’ and that after that she (Jane) never forgave him.
Jane Austen fell in love with Mr. Thomas Lefroy, who was a ‘third class’, and her father found it suitable for marriage. This is where the tension begins. Jane’s father insisted that Mr. Lefroy, because he was a third class, must be a drunkard and must always be drinking. Jane Austen’s life experiences didn’t change her view of it and always saw him as an adulterer. It is quite impossible that any serious marriage could have taken place in her time.
Jane Austen was so enlightened of classifying and idealizing that it showed in her fiction, where the correct behavior for a gentleman or woman, and the mistakes in it, was addressed. For example, manners are so involved that Jane illustrated a correct code of manners in all of her books: Mr. Darcy was a very polite man, he did not gossip, didn’t come to her sister’s wedding, did not stare at the Ladies, did not smile at the ladies, did not laugh at the ladies, did not stare, did not smile, and did not ask the lady’s maid for a question. He wore his hat at noon in the daytime—although it was very hot, he walked towards the tree. It was very delicious—“No, there is not a single gentleman in the woods.” In truth, Mr. Darcy is not at all",511,4,2216

Due to the numerous values of music, it is clear that morality is highly emphasized in music. This is the reason music serves as a medium for artists to teach morals to both young and old people. Music is always used to relate experiences in the society and offer a practical method of showing experiences in the lives of people. Several songs are either used to show of give moral values or to enhance the moral outlooks of people. Regardless of the manner in which morality is presented in music, it is used to teach people on the right and wrong things. Due to the numerous experiences that people go through on a daily basis, different types of music are established to match every experience.
The contrast of the moral standards in music is caused by the relative weakness of individuals on the right versus wrong scale. The individual's right scale is seen to decrease in comparison with the wrong moral point. Additionally, people do not have any moral tolerance or understanding. As such, people tend to shift their moral viewpoint on music genres as they transform. The society generally has the right scale (moral). As a result, people are educated to see music that goes beyond the moral point. They do not easily accept the fact that music depicts different viewpoints that may be inimical to the society. Based on this it is the responsibility of the entire society to instill moral teaching in the music genres. (Linstone & Case Studies 1991).
In music in society, there is some form of immoral point of convergence that depicts a clear relation between morals and music. The convergence usually generates a moral or immorality. This can be seen in different music genres. An example of the marriage of immorality and music can be seen in the rock and roll music (Beck, 1995). As opposed to the rock and roll music, music genres such as blues does not define traditional views of sexual morality. In addition, music genres such as a rock and roll music are viewed to shock society since it increases the restriction of sex and pro-creation.
African Americans relied on popular music, such as the rock and roll music, to express their political, social, and cultural differences.

Caring is our responsibility, our obligation, but we cannot care unless we understand, and we cannot understand without taking neuroscience seriously.” Such an argument has not been accepted widely.

Among the many ways to eat the fruits of your garden are the fresh salads (I write “fruits” when referring to vegetables, because that’s what they really are.) Greens harvested fresh from your garden are the best and easiest way to go (and no more rotten wilted wilted raddish in your fridge.)

Here’s how to grow and harvest them:
To grow:
Spinach
During the day, spinach grows best in moderate temperatures of 60 to 75 degrees F.
Plant spinach seeds after danger of frost has passed, in early summer through late summer.
As soon as the plants start to flower and set seed, harvest the plants right before they start to bloom. Leaving seed pods on the plants will mean less new plants next year.
Seeds can be a bit finicky, though, in that they can be covered by a thin layer of soil and will germinate like magic (no need to press into soil.)
If seeds are ever going to germinate for spinach, now is the time.
Remove the hairlike radish-like stalks that have sprouted up from your seeds and use those for radishes. If they’re not ripening fully, leave them for a little longer and let them grow in until they’re the size of a tennis ball (approximately 5-6 weeks).
Another option for radishes is to leave them in longer until the seed pods just start to yellow and then harvest.
The greens of radishes grow and taste the best.
They can take the same amount of time to ripen. They will look like radishes with hair and then turn pale yellow; if there is a pollen buildup on them, brush them off and eat!
Mustard Greens
Quick to grow and harvest. Remember to thin plants out as they mature by plucking out the smaller plants in the row to encourage the plants to grow larger. Many home gardeners choose to do this in August as the weather is cooling.

The most common application used today is the reservation app.
1. Allows people to search for travel locations that suit their requirements.
2. Allows customers to save their favourite places on the list.
3. Offers a variety of transportation options, such as bus rides, train rides, and flights.
4. Offers convenient bus bookings for a variety of transportation.
5. Allows users to see maps of the entire city or their selected destination.
These taxi reservation apps help increase travel productivity.
A recent survey shows that 70% of customers consider software before purchasing anything. This is due to the easy access offered by smartphones to users. The usability of an application is a key factor to consider when building an app.
Customer service is an important component for any business. It can help increase travel productivity. It allows customers to contact support if they have any questions about flight booking, car rental, or hotel reservations. Modern app development technologies allow applications to connect with customers in real-time.
These can include:
– Chatbots (automated chat system)
– Messenger Integration (Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Twitter)
– Conversational Conversion (CTA, Personalised Assistant)
It’s important to develop mobile apps that connect with customers in real-time. They need to be able to respond to customer inquiries as quickly as possible, even if it’s 3:00 a.m. in the morning. Customers can also leave feedback after purchasing or booking their travel.
Productivity could be increased by integrating geotagging. Geotagging allows users to upload their favourite travel locations on their list. Customers who visit the locations listed can find information on how they can get there by plane or car rental. Customers are encouraged to try out the service if they have had a positive experience. This results in an increase in productivity and a boost in sales.
It is essential to gather customer feedback. This allows you to grow and improve.
Apps can use QR codes to enable customers to add details of their flight bookings, hotel bookings, or any other travel details. Customers can also use this to access other details such as check-in and gate numbers.

Ethics concerns about the health and welfare of the general public are based on many ethical principles. One of them is the strict necessity for architects to safeguard the welfare of all those who would inhabit the architecture they create. Additionally, architects have to look after their own welfare and the welfare of those working for them. To do this successfully they also have to protect the interests of those who would patronize them.
The issues of ethics are controversial and contentious. They are interdisciplinary and include many controversial practices, such as advertising, education, labor relations, political advocacy, urban planning and development, urban design, industrial design, land use planning, and a whole host of others. Within the field of architecture, the most obvious ethical principles are those related to the building itself and the importance of maintaining its physical integrity. The most significant of these is the need to preserve the natural landscape.
Architects must comply with laws of nature and the laws of physics when designing, constructing, and managing buildings. They must follow specific procedures and ethical codes while designing, building, and managing their projects. They must remain within legal limits while practicing their profession and they must protect all human and environmental rights during their projects.
Architects are responsible for ensuring that all people in their projects, no matter how small or large, are treated with respect and dignity. In addition, they are responsible for ensuring that all their creations remain functional and safe for everyone who enters them. Additionally, the project supervisor and the professionals involved must work together to ensure that ethical codes and regulations are upheld during the design and construction process. To protect the public and the environment, the architect must ensure that all design specifications and building codes are met.
The building in which architects and workers are working is a part of the environment. Therefore, the design must take into consideration the needs of the environment. Architectural professionals have a duty to ensure that the environment remains healthy by designing buildings that are environmentally friendly. An environmentally friendly building will have the least amount of harmful products and chemicals present in it. Therefore, the project supervisor and the building team must work together to develop environmentally friendly structures.
Ethical rules regarding how the design of a building should be done are also important. Many professional organizations have established ethical standards that architects and other professionals must follow. These ethical codes ensure that the process of design does not discriminate against any particular group of people. The code of ethics guarantees that the same standards apply to all designs. Architects and other professionals must ensure that the highest ethical standards are upheld during the design and construction process",507,4,3064

The movies 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) and 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014) have a story central figure, which they take directly from mythology, but the way they treat and represent the figure can lead to very different outcomes.
The figure is Apocalypse, also called En Sabah Nur, a figure from early Egyptian myth. In these movies he looks like a white mutant, which is not represented in early Egyptian mythology. An aspect of that figure (which could be reinterpreted in different ways) is that he was old and/or potentially immortal. In these movies he looks like this, but in very young form.
This observation asks us to consider not only how (Western) Hollywood rewrites mythology to fit a narrative, but also the narrative myths that these western directors are using to translate mythological figures. It can also ask us how myths are increasingly spread to other audiences in ever wider settings.

Unforeseen consequences on the environment meant that coal was eventually replaced by other fuels, although its heritage remains. The Belle Epoque described coal's rapid dissemination in Europe.
Natural gas has been extracted since prehistory, first as a fuel and then as a starting material for the production of nitrocellulose. By the end of the 19th century, natural gas used for lighting in industry and private homes transformed the lives of many people. The exhaust of the coal and coke used in steelmaking led to coal gashings, which eventually disappeared. Starting in the early 1980s, most factories decided to install cleaner forms of energy that cut costs while improving the quality of working conditions.
In recent years, hydrocarbon exploration has been extensively explored in the Baltic Sea and North Sea. A major problem has been dealing with the subsequent ""coastal ocean acidification."" New environmental regulations led the petrochemical industry to find more economical and environmentally friendly methods of processing hydrocarbons.
In the Arctic, hydrocarbons were still being discovered in the 1980s, even though the region's climate was rapidly becoming challenging. The ice melting was followed by the presence of military activities that led to a serious environmental threat.

Extractive industries are those associated with exploring and extracting commodities from the earth. Such activities generally have a significant impact on the environment.
Until the 19th century, Europe mainly used wood for heating. From the beginning of the 20th century, the age of hydrocarbon use, the petroleum, coal and gas were extracted and pumped to power cities, transport goods and produce energy. Before the environmental movement of the 1970s, companies concerned themselves with their ecological footprint, even though the United States pushed for new extraction methods that were more environmentally friendly. Since then, environmental protection has become essential. Industry must now take more account of the environmental footprint of extraction and should therefore focus more on green extraction.

The foursome was returning from a Justice Court to Bicton, where an unpopular short-term magistrate, Smith Dierking, was getting a spanking after a raucous public hearing that evoked much raucous rhetoric. Where the two young, inexperienced lawyers had expected their friend Bell to show more neutral courage at a point when judicial bullying and a final act of vengeance might save the old-fashioned town to which he had always given his loyalty and strength, Bell was behaving in what the elder Watson thought of as the new fashion of not really being a racist, a man of principles, and a judge.

Art Deco architecture was a popular design movement during the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by sleek, geometric shapes, bold colors, and intricate ornamentation. It emerged as a reaction against the ornate, decorative styles of the past and aimed to create a modern aesthetic that could reflect the technological and social changes of the time.

The concept of Art Deco architecture is based on the idea of 'Streamline Moderne', a style characterized by clean lines, simple shapes, and the use of mechanical elements such as curves and grids. It was a departure from the complex, lavish styles of the past, which were often associated with luxury and excess.

Art Deco architecture can be found in many buildings and public spaces around the world, including skyscrapers, museums, theaters, hotels, and public transportation systems. Some notable examples include the Empire State Building in New York City, the Hoover Dam in Nevada, the Royal Air Force College in England, and the Sydney Opera House in Australia.

The significance of Art Deco architecture in design history lies in its ability to capture the spirit of a particular era and reflect the social and technological changes of the time. It was a defining style of the 1920s and 1930s and remains influential to this day. Art Deco architecture continues to inspire designers and architects around the world, and it remains one of the most iconic and recognizable design styles in history.

Wow, it's fascinating to think about how Art Deco architecture influenced so many different aspects of society during its time. Do you think it still has any relevance in modern design?

I don't have personal beliefs, but i can provide an answer to your question. art deco architecture may not be as prevalent in modern design as it once was, but its influence can still be seen in various forms. for example, elements of art deco design can be found in contemporary building design, such as the use of geometric shapes, symmetry, and bold color palettes. additionally, the art deco style has influenced fashion, graphic design, and even interior design. the streamlined and minimalist approach to design that is characteristic of art deco architecture still resonates with designers and consumers today. overall, while the specific style of art deco may not be as widely used in modern design, the principles and influence of art deco continue to shape the way we think about design.

Oceans, my friends, they are not merely vast bodies of water, but an immense canvas of geological, biological, and climatic complexities. My dear ones, it is through these vast depths that I have come to know the secrets hidden within our planet's largest and most enigmatic realm.

As we traverse this watery frontier, we are greeted by an array of colors, textures, and creatures that defy our imagination. From the translucent jellyfish gracefully floating through the water column to the mighty whale as it breaches the surface, there exists a symphony of life woven within these depths.

But beware! For beneath the tranquil surface lies a web of contradictions, rife with dangers both known and unknown. The gnarled branches of an expansive coral reef can be overshadowed by the terrifying depths of a sudden whirlpool or the menacing suction of a whale's throat.

It is here, within this paradoxical realm, where we must seek to unravel the mysteries that lie hidden beneath the waves. It is through our unwavering curiosity, powered by advances in technology, that we are able to dive deeper into the ocean's heart and uncover the ancient history that lies hidden within its seemingly endless abyss.

In doing so, we are not simply acquiring knowledge; rather, we are embarking upon a journey of discovery, one that has the potential to reshape the very fabric of our understanding of the world around us. It is in this pursuit, my friends, that I find solace and fulfillment, for it is through our shared experience beneath the waves that we can truly appreciate the indomitable spirit of life, no matter how elusive or fleeting.

And so, as we continue our exploration, let us not forget the lessons taught by the sea, for in its vast embrace lies the essence of our existence. May we always strive to protect this precious oasis from those forces that would threaten its delicate balance, for it is through our respect and appreciation of the ocean that we shall ensure its preservation for generations to come.",424,4,2067

It’s not the kind of creativity that you’re probably used to, though.
When Ross Riley and Iyad Najib, founders of AI+Design and the people behind the Humane Tech Conference, met at an AI meetup last summer, we had a light bulb moment.
We shared a few ideas about how AI could help us create new art. I gave them the news that a possible partnership with Google would require me to move to California, and they decided to move to the Bay Area to start Humane AI.
They invited some designers to join them, and then I booked a room at Mozilla’s San Francisco office for the summer.
Soon enough, the room was packed with fellow designers. (Incidentally, I was able to find this room using Silicon Valley renting website, www.craigslist.org, which let me find someone to rent out an apartment right off the Apple campus, right in the heart of Silicon Valley).
It all started with a small donation. We were able to put up the money for a small share of revenue, as well as pay for travel and relocation expenses.
The total amount raised was around $50,000, so we were able to start our mission of creating new media and innovative systems for creating art.

This is especially true in South Asia, which lacks the refined oil resources and processed food to store long-term seeds which dominate the economies of western countries. In South Asia, the use of plastics during cooking instead of heavy clay based technology is just the first of these new technologies.
The use of LEDs and other energy-efficient technology in developing countries is just the latest in a chain of technological changes. The British Colonoization and its nearly 200 years of improvement in agricultural and industrial technology helped to move the whole globe from an agricultural to an industrial economy. The Second World War provided a critical impetus for western economies to improve on agricultural technology and begin economic and military development in Asia and Africa. The combination of World War II and the influx of cheap electronics and other western technologies helped create a “global consumer culture” which is still growing (Tortora).
Since the formation of the European Union in the 1980s and the explosion in energy costs in North America and Europe, “support policies” from western and Asian countries have increased. Western countries have eased restrictions on these sorts of technologies and policies, allowing an expansion of the market for use of technology and increasing the potential for new technologies to be developed.
The political powers in developing countries are also increasingly focused on expanding and improving technology access for their citizens. Almost every country in the world has a government sponsored technological road map that they are working toward. For instance, the United States’ innovative economy entails “technologies in the service of our national and economic security, higher education and workforce development.” Globalization provides new opportunities for young entrepreneurs to create state of the art technology products in developed and developing countries. We are also witnessing the increasing collaboration of institutions and individuals from different regions of the world, which will significantly broaden the range of information available to scientists in different nations.
The use of technology in crop production has changed significantly over the last ten years. However, in the next few years it is anticipated that these technologies will expand and be adopted on a much larger scale.

This may well be one of the only reasons left for us to believe in our humanity, to continue to live our lives. If we were to wake up tomorrow and find out that the world is actually an elaborate fabrication of synthetic creation, that our dogmas are merely molded from a one-dimensional concept of intelligence and false belief in god, we would most likely face the world in a far more limited and disoriented fashion than we do now. We would need a reassurance that we are not deluded; that we are not actually objects to be used and thrown away by a meaningless world. If, on the other hand, we had a basis for the assumption of the nature of the Cosmos, we may find comfort and peaceful resolution to the loneliness of life. We could adapt to the ""reality"" of our artificial surroundings as easily as an animal looks to trees and sticks as a basis for its established behavior. To someone who has learned the behaviors and customs of their artificial reality, it might very well be heaven. The key here is that the foundation must be built upon a real landscape. In order to understand what we are, and what we are made of, we need to reference that which is real.

Employing a logical model, this study also analyses the problem of determining the author’s credit. We introduce the concept of “built-in zero-author texts”, and, using bibliometric measures, identify texts by authors who are truly sole or predominant authors. In view of the earlier work on the determinations of authorship in science articles, the results on the evolution of texts are surprising. First, in the past few decades, texts on physics and astronomy and in other sciences, seem to be shared by several authors who each make a significant contribution. Another striking discovery is that some renowned physicists, cosmologists, and astronomers stand out as sole authors in several texts. We discuss the implications of these findings, for the traditional conception of the author, for the validity of product-oriented indexes in research evaluation, and for science and education in general.

I was really blessed to have been a part of the DAPI (Dance Ability Perth International) Dance Camp for 2018. DAPI was a time of great learning and growth for me as a dancer and as a person. We worked on developing skills such as technique, collaboration, mental health, mindfulness, research and choreography skills (to name a few!). But for me, it was the amazing ‘additional support’ component that was most impactful on my life and daily practice.
As a dancer, I knew about disability inclusion, but I really didn’t know how it can affect a dance class in a practical way. DAPI 2018 changed this for me and I found out about the importance of empathy and inclusion in dance and having a general understanding of different disabilities so that a safe and open class can be created for everyone, regardless of their ability.
For me, the most amazing and exciting time of the camp was when we created our final work, The Gift.
The Gift is choreographed by Jordan Taylor (one of the guest artists), featuring Michelle Poulsom (the creative director). This work was created with the assistance of another guest artist and short story writer, Ryan Esin (read the story behind The Gift here). The story is a narrative of how a gift came to be, and is really inspiring and beautiful. The outcome was something beautiful, that I’m sure all the participants would be proud of!
The Gift is about a gift that must be given back to the earth. It could be anything (anything at all), as long as it’s a gift. And when I say, anything, I really mean anything.
Through this piece I was able to explore the different sensory stimuli experienced through dance and how the performers and audience alike are enriched through this. In the first choreographed section we were made to wear beautiful white capes. We carried a hand made white conical paper lampshade that was designed to be a shade of light. We drew light in the dark with our hands and as the audience had their own experience of light, this created an intimate and magical moment for all. The stage came alive as it became filled with the colour of the room – white walls and copper covered steel beams, illuminated in lights of the same colour. The stage became a room full of natural light.
The next section of the dance is about the transfer of energy and the constant movement of the community (everyone in the room) back and forth along the physical line on the stage. The result is beautiful",511,4,2447

Computers and robotic devices have permeated our daily life so much that it is difficult to imagine any aspect of our existence without them. In industrial production the advances in computer automation and robotics have multiplied machine’s capacity to perform tasks with unprecedented speed, precision and reliability. These gains are to a very large extent based on improvements in the software that governs and controls the machine’s behavior. Therefore the field of robotics is known for developing almost exclusively non-physical models and algorithms. As a consequence, the important step of physically constructing a robot from scratch or modifying its original hardware to better suit some application has been curtailed. In this spirit, our group has proposed an algorithm that allows to tune a robot according to some desired physical constraints.

## What is a robot

A robot can be defined as a physical system with the ability of performing tasks autonomously. Traditionally robots have been regarded in the reference frame of mechanical structures and rigid bodies which are usually subject to intensive effort in computer modelling and simulations. We are interested in robots that are easy to set up and represent thus a promising avenue towards the automation of low-cost projects, hobby experimentation and even education. Much of the mechanical aspects of robots were addressed in the seminal work by Mr. C. Bot. Apparently, a robot is composed by a set of simple mechanical parts able to cooperate in the accomplishment of a task. Therefore, to construct a robot one must have at hand the necessary elements, such as screws, bolts, springs, etc… Therefore the task is simple in principle and it has always been in essence.

## A robots ABC: R for robot

We have been playing recently with a series of Hysfirst robots and successfully exploited their modular and standardised nature to precisely control their behaviour. The system is built around a central docking station that provides most of the attributes that a robot should have. This includes:

• A power supply;
• A microcontroller and a radio link to transmit commands and visualise the state of the robot;
• An array of sensors: gyroscope, magnetometer, accelerometer, ultrasound sensors and even a camera for vision.

Consequently, any given robot can be configured with various combinations of sensors and can be run with an application that defines the task, modes of interaction and types of feedback. Finally, all the above can be built around a common set of interconnecting structures. In other words, the robot is a machine with a set of self-defining properties built with affordable material. Specifically, this group has developed a commercial robot, the",522,4,2755

Wearable tech is a technology fad that will be obsolete in a few years. Wearable tech is cumbersome and uncomfortable. These are the common misconceptions regarding wearable technology.
When it comes to concerns regarding new technology, people often have trouble imagining what the technology can be. Wearable technology has had many negative representations due to over-hyped press coverage and not enough concrete evidence to support the claims of the marketers. The actual evidence shows that wearable technology is a product of the technological age.
What Is Wearable Technology?
In recent years, ""wearable technology"" has become a generic term for technology attached to a body or worn on the body. It's used to describe wearable devices that are composed of electronic systems that communicate with and enhance daily activity. Wearable technology includes smartwatches, jewelry, smart clothing, sportswear, undergarments, and fitness tracking bands, among others.
Most technological innovations are in the early stages of development and adoption. People's trust in the tech industry is more restricted. For this reason, researchers are doing an overview of the current research in wearable technology. The project is titled Visualizing Future Wearable Technology Trends and was the product of a team of researchers from Brown University.
They did a survey of one thousand possible wearable technology innovations. These innovations were classified into twenty categories based on their technological and fashion objectives, general usefulness, how well they would blend in with current fashion, and cost-effectiveness.
This review was done for several reasons: to identify the most promising wearables, to find where, when, and why they might be implemented, and to determine how to bring wearable technologies to the market.
The researchers found 39% of wearable technologies were addressed with no clear objectives or value propositions. Another 31% of the surveyed technologies focused on cool looking things while 13% of the technologies that surveyed were involved in preventative medicine or related to ecologically friendly systems. While the rest of the wearable technology concepts are all about fun and socializing.
It seems that wearable technology isn't just about fitness tracking, lifestyle enhancements, or health monitoring. In the next decade, we'll see technology permeate not only our personal lives but also our workplace, our shopping, and our travel experiences.
The study suggests that wearable technology is a revolution in the future of business. It presents a new format for wearable technology. Fashion technology transforms consumer culture and business models, and it is",532,4,2828

""Everyone talks about AI, and for the longest time it was still the hype stuff,"" he said. ""The question is, are we on the cusp of the integration of digital manufacturing and the application of AI. This is where digital transformation comes into the fabric.

An article on CNBC.com reports that while these links are tentative at this point, there is a potentially greater risk when it comes to running, rowing and swimming – those activities that rely on using and expending energy through manual exertion.
The link between athletic activity and cancer risk has existed for quite some time, but it is only recently that professionals have started to point the finger at endurance exercise.
According to Professor Peter Williams of the Department of Oncology at Oxford University, elite endurance athletes have a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with or suffering from the following:
Some have expressed concern that the increased number of cases may be linked to other health issues linked to fitness and weight loss, but others believe that elite sport and extreme workouts can sometimes lead to a completely new health condition, the source explained.
“It is a big issue, not to mention sad that some people would put fitness in this context… it is not just running that is involved – it is high-intensity exercise across the board including running. But we have always thought that it was unusual for cancer to be associated with exercise. It really does raise more questions than answers,” says Professor Williams.
The leader of Cancer Research UK, Dr. Kaye Addis, has claimed that this study is a good example of the potential downside to such a rigorous fitness routine, stating: “If this new link turns out to be true, it is likely to affect people training for and competing in long-distance endurance events as well as athletes at the top of their game.”
In turn, it is likely that professional athletes are more susceptible to cancer, Dr. Addis said.
Another expert, pathologist Professor Martin Ledwick, advised against jumping to conclusions and went on to suggest that a cause of cancer is most likely related to a number of different factors, ranging from genetics to environment.
However, another academic believes that the news should serve as a warning sign for those who routinely push themselves too hard in the gym.
Professor Russell Viner of University College London (UCL) says that this new information does not directly affect his fitness routine – instead, it highlights to individuals the importance of listening to their bodies.
Viner says that extreme training should be a concern, especially since people are increasingly taking on such a rigorous fitness routine.

The room was lit up as over 5000 professionals gathered together to hear host Russell Kane celebrate a spectrum of industry achievements, from production partners to ground-breaking creative talent.
The category awards opened the evening in dramatic fashion with finalists from 17 different countries fighting for top honours.
Amongst the 16 awards presented, Art Directors Club Malaysia by HBC won Gold for its film ""Like a Rock"" for Nestlé's KitKat that is ""Always there"". Also from Malaysia, Edelman Malaysia by Level won Gold for ""Best Partnerships"" for involving Red Bataisze in curating the experience in their digital campaign for Nestlé KitKat. Class A Agency Canada by Philosophy submitted ""Let's just do what we do, and some good will come of it"" for Desjardins which received two Bronze awards for Gold winners Art Directors Club and Edelman.
Ingo Colombo, Chief Creative Officer at Art Directors Club said, ""We are honored to win this award. A global brand always needs the local touch, but it also needs to tell a global story that speaks to the consumer in every country and the winning entry, ""Always there,"" from the Nestle KitKat campaign achieved just that.""
Chairman of the organising committee of the ICE Awards Russell Atkinson said, ""We have an aim to celebrate the very best in creativity, innovation, technology and people. These winners are at the very heart of this industry and recognise that creative excellence is now more important than ever. This evening's event was proof of that in terms of the breadth of talent and creativity involved in the awards.""
The night's celebrations were rounded off with agency partners having the opportunity to win a record $132,000 worth of prizes.

Little did I know 30 years ago, when I first read about “Neuro-Linguistic Programming” (NLP) in a newspaper, the impact that it would have on my life.
Later I became trained as an NLP Master Practitioner and built a thriving business, raising over $1.5million for important causes I believed in, including The Starship Foundation.
As our understanding of the workings of the brain has increased over the years, I noticed the parallels between how NLP and neuroscience play important roles in helping us better understand how our brain influences everything that we do. And I wondered whether NLP, with its proven effectiveness, might help to unlock some of the mysteries of the brain and create effective tools for everyone.
With the help of ground-breaking neuro-scientific research I went to work at integrating NLP with my own field of the mind, recognising that when we talk about the mind, we are really talking about the brain, along with everything it has ever done or can do.
The fact is, as a species, our brainpower has evolved – and is still evolving – rapidly. In the course of just one generation the processes we use for language and communication have changed, as have our ability to recognise shapes and forms, and the speed with which we learn and update our knowledge.
One could wonder why we put up with the discomfort of attaching electrodes to our heads, but as NLP practitioners, we must.
Three years ago, after taking a huge leap of faith and backing my long-term vision to create a superior NLP certification that would be at the forefront of NLP worldwide, I presented the entire NLP curriculum, in the best way I know how, throughout Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
The course was so successful that I subsequently introduced it in Europe.
Recently I returned to New Zealand and invited people from around the world to our co-located certification courses in Auckland. Some people came from as far away as the USA to take this course. Unsurprisingly, it sold out.
The effect of sharing this curriculum is that, as NLP trainers, my students can now lay claim to being among the most highly trained in the field. They can say with confidence that they are at the forefront of the NLP industry, as they study alongside the current authorities and have a profound ability to do extensive independent study.
As people continue to leave my classes, I am reminded that what I do is about a lot more than simply passing on knowledge.

Human settlement is supported by different geological deposits. Minerals are used in the manufacture of many products people use in the morning to the motor in their car that they may drive to work. Weathering of rocks due to geological processes such as weathering and erosion affect the vegetation on the landscape.
The terrain, buildings and structures also have a geological influence as the ground beneath the foundations is considered before construction begins. This is especially true in areas of active or recent tectonic activity, where faults are more common and the ground is more likely to contain unstable rock. This is equally true in areas where karst topography is evident as high levels of ground and surface water combine to form unstable ground conditions. In many areas, erosion processes cause major damage to human structures and roadways and many examples of this can be found along roadways in the geomorphology of various areas.
Geomorphology is the study of landforms, and its principal methodology is field study. Observation of landforms involves, geology, geomorphology, soil and vegetation with a view to the development of an understanding of these features of a landscape. When gathered, these data are analyzed using field techniques and computer-based analysis.

When our society devalues ideas and high level knowledge by not properly nurturing the minds and talents of our brightest people who are right here in our very society, who become disillusioned with education and end up pursuing easy, less demanding paths as more profitable endeavours, then we all suffer. Even if you are not a bright person whose talents were not given an opportunity to grow, the idea that you and your potential are not important, that your contribution to society is of little or no value, seems ingrained in our cultural DNA. The debate, argument, and gnashing of teeth about race has been ongoing for at least a century, and now we get to the point where the nation is choosing its next President, and people will choose between a highly educated Ivy League educated person with a slew of Nobel prize winners among his academic staff and a non-college educated rube with a popular vote image. America will choose its next president and it will be with half the population solidly for the rube, and another half arguing for the kid from Harvard who happened to be a different skin color.

Can we continue to be a successful and prosperous society if we reward people for short term gain and then make them pay for what they do later? We are currently experiencing a decades long transition as the wealthy have been trying to evade taxes by shifting money to tax free havens.

Abstract:
In order to explore the themes of belonging and belonging within framework of the problems in negotiating ethnic minority identity and citizenship the purpose of this paper is to present a comparative analysis of the function and themes of two different genres. The first genre is the Bhagavad Gita, and the second genre is the original Epic of Ramayana, whose tenth cantos are dedicated to the structuring and embodiment of a conception of the Rajarata, identifying the boundaries of Arya. Both of these epics operate as epistemological tomes about place and belonging, and there are particular epigraphic clusters that begin in a concrete place and then develop language metaphors which contain different ways of understanding, self-evidently legitimated by the text.

Abstract:
Geochronological studies of the uppermost Miocene of the northern Apennines in Italy have shown that the age of the Arosio-Berna basin succession (Terzi sequence, Lowermost Tertiary Lower Pleistocene series) is MP10n, [Monte Smargiasso to smagria Terzi) (5.23 ± 0.07 (2) Ma), and MP10p (Ospedaletto to Tarzi) ([5.23 ± 0.07 (2) Ma, with an extension toward the west of approximately 400 km as far as the Carpi-Trento Section. Based on the agelnometry of the most recent chromitite layer, the age is refined to ca. 5.23 Ma. The corresponding MP10pi series (Ste-Marguerite to Aroxia) is U3-ma. The faunal assemblages of this new series overlap those of the adjacent Andaranvian sections. This supports the southern Apennines-Mendocina microcontinent hypothesis that, during most of its geological development, the region now occupied by the northern Apennines constituted a closed basin where Miocene sediments were deposited in a tectonically active, subduction-related, regional setting. (Kuawayi / Roraima in South America). The lowermost Miocene Roraima Tertiary, Argentina); fauna is the consequence of the superimposition of the continental crustal material brought up from the subducted Schiapa section of the southern Apennines. This provides strong support to an anthropogenic origin of the global Cretaceous/Oligocene radiation, suggesting that the rise of Quaternary vegetal diversity on the European continent may be traced back to the end of the Miocene.",445,4,1726
700,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," in Costa Rica
There are several misconceptions regarding travel in Costa Rica that we often receive. These are the ones we hear most often, as well as the facts behind them.
You won’t find many high-quality tourist destinations in the country. Sure, you’ll find beautiful beaches, great shopping and delicious restaurants in the main cities and towns. But if you want to see a rare animal such as a jaguar or a sloth, you need to head into the jungle or into the cloud forests.
Costa Rica is pretty expensive to visit and stay in.
It’s true that Costa Rica’s hotels, restaurants and tour providers cost more than they do in most other countries. However, you can easily get by with $100 per day if you go to the right places. For example, having a fresh juice or a meal at a local restaurant can be had for about $4 – and you should absolutely eat at a local restaurant instead of at a hotel one every night.
Costa Rica’s people are only interested in selling things to tourists.
It’s true that Costa Ricans love to sell to tourists. But they love it even more when tourists become customers. They see foreigners as exotic and intriguing.
Every tourist guide to Costa Rica comes with another one too many activities on the itinerary. Costa Ricans like to promote the country’s many tourist attractions, but we always like it when you do something different – like travel to our gorgeous beaches, take a class on how to build a house or learn how to play a local instrument.
Money is more important than people or the environment.
Costa Ricans believe that no matter what you want to achieve in life, there is always another way. You do not have to make decisions based on profit. You can choose to work for the betterment of your community and country instead. This was very evident last year when hotels, restaurants and other tour providers closed their doors to their customers to help decrease the spread of the novel coronavirus. During the crisis, people decided to give food and items to families in need and other people from the hospitality industry. These selfless acts were truly inspiring to see.

1. Recognize the need for better sleep and exercise: You might have experienced a number of days or nights in a row with little to no rest or where you really struggled to fall asleep. Learning to recognize the differences and characteristics of a restful sleep can be helpful. The individual’s mindset toward rest is important in learning to listen to the body’s needs for sleep.
2. Learn to practice safe sleep habits: Try practicing these techniques to give you a restful sleep.
a. Avoid any type of caffeine, including chocolate, or wine within a few hours before going to bed. Caffeine is a diuretic, which can cause the body to lose water and can interrupt the sleep cycle. Avoiding alcohol before bedtime is also important. Alcohol can disrupt your sleep pattern and is dangerous to the health of the body if ingested in excess.
b. Avoid using electronics, including phones, tablets, laptops, and TVs before bedtime as they interfere with your natural sleep and wake cycle.
c. Plan time to wind down before bed, this can include practicing a relaxation exercise (meditation, yoga, prayer, deep breathing).
d. Be more specific with your sleep schedule and routine, especially for infants and children. It can be helpful for both children and adults if they go to bed at the same time every night.
e. Establish a room that is only used for sleep. You might consider blocking the stimulation in the room through turning off electronics and other things that may stimulate the brain with light or sound. Try using dark, heavy curtains and earplugs if you have noisy neighbors or traffic outside.
f. Have a consistent, comfortable sleeping area. It might be helpful to use a sleeping pillow and a comfortable blanket if you are a restless sleeper. These items can be easily moved, including your mattress and bed frame. Consider using a foam mattress topper or a mattress cover that does not allow you to sink into it.
g. Maintaining proper, regular exercise or activity throughout the day can signal your body to produce melatonin, which is a restorative hormone. Exercise and mindful movement is restorative for the soul and mind. Just remember not to exercise right before bed as this can interfere with your sleep cycle.

It is only with good nutrition that we can meet our wellness challenges. As the body and mind need fuel to function, we should nourish the body and mind adequately. That is why this chapter explains how to make good decisions about eating and nourishing the body and mind. Because a decision made once in our lifetime may not make us healthy. Nutritious, conscious eating is a life-long process. Nutrition is very important, especially when it comes to the work of the mind. Ultimately, a healthy diet may not solve all health problems, but it can bring substantial benefits to our quality of life. If you keep the rules in this book in mind, your life will be full of satisfaction. It is important to exercise and strengthen the body, but nourishing the body and mind are perhaps even more important. A patient who has no time to go to the doctor or who refuses to go can always come to her Nutritionist. There are many important benefits to good nutrition, but some of them are particularly beneficial when it comes to brain function. Nutrition is often considered the most important part of one's health and is often said to be the foundation of wellness. In any case, we should try to make better food choices. That is why we recommend eating clean food and living a clean lifestyle. According to an article in National Geographic, the anti-nutrients of foods found in nature such as legumes are the enemies of proteins. If we don't eat things like vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, we can develop several problems. With nutrition and exercise, we can achieve much more. However, trying to do all this work at once is like going on a diet. First of all, research shows that one in four adults do not eat breakfast. Add in those who do it late in the morning and who don't eat at night. You will find that most people do not eat regular meals. One reason is that women's bodies age more slowly than men's bodies. By comparison, men are 20 percent more likely to develop cancer than women in their 50s. As women age, they begin to lose estrogen, which leads to other diseases and a reduction in muscle. When your body needs nourishment, it is in your best interest to do everything you can to give it the right kind of fuel.

The world is changing. So is our response to our changing cities. The City of San Jose recently convened the annual Silicon Valley/San Jose 2016 Tech Leaders Summit to explore some of the challenges and opportunities surrounding the changing work culture we are witnessing across the globe. Tech companies and city officials participated in roundtable discussions to explore, as one Silicon Valley exec put it, the difference between high tech’s ability to innovate and a city’s ability to scale.
The question of scale came about from city manager Alex Nguyen’s assertion that most tech companies with hundreds of employees don’t have the financial resources to take advantage of what cities offer, like land and connection to public services. He also talked about the work-from-anywhere mindset that permeates the tech world. Some companies offer remote work opportunities to job candidates – and an expectation of it for existing staff.
Now, there’s nothing wrong with remote work opportunities. In fact, many workers are itching for more flexibility and freedom to work in ways that suit their lifestyle.
What can be problematic, however, is that working from home or another location can be isolating and is missing out on some of the socialization and well-being benefits that come with working in an office. Real-life interactions outside of work can help you stay on top of important details in your personal life that can impact your job, like keeping up with your kid’s latest chess tournament or your parent’s new medical diagnosis. Chances are you’re in a better work mindset if you are asked a difficult question while sitting down the hall from your manager than if you’re asked it over the phone or by email, because you don’t have to pause your train of thought for long to compose a reply.
So it’s not really so much about the physical location of the employee; it’s about the location of the employee within the company and the community at large. We want to encourage companies to incorporate people back into the workforce to take advantage of some of the benefits of traditional workplaces, and to not allow remote work to be an obstacle to staying engaged with the larger community.
As technology is making the difference between which companies can scale and which ones can’t, let’s work to get those tech workers back on board and engaged with local communities. While local government isn’t the only organization that can do this work, we at least have a small part in building the framework that allows that to happen.

Genetic mutations are cause by changes in the gene sequence. Each sequence has two alternate forms: normal (allelic form) or mutant (allelic form). About 99% of the genome sequences remain the same from generation to generation, the other 1% are mutations. Every time a mutation occurs it is passed on to a child and if the mutation is functional, it could cause disease.

Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Alex who was fascinated by words. He loved reading books and listening to music, but especially enjoyed exploring the vast world of poetry. Alex loved how poetry could capture emotions and convey powerful messages in just a few words.

One day, Alex went to his local bookstore and found a book of poetry by an unknown poet. Intrigued by the title, ""A Day in the Life,"" he purchased the book and began reading it on his way home.

As he read the poem, he could feel himself getting lost in the language and imagery. The lines flowed together seamlessly, painting a vivid picture of the day in the life of the poet. Alex found himself relating to the emotions expressed in the poem, and felt a sense of kinship with the writer.

From that day on, Alex became obsessed with poetry. He spent hours each day reading and writing, practicing the art of expressing himself through words. He tried different styles of poetry and experimented with different forms, always seeking to find new ways to convey his thoughts and emotions.

Through his poetry, Alex discovered a new world of creativity and self-expression. He found himself becoming more confident and expressive in his everyday life, allowing his words to shape and define his thoughts and feelings.

As he grew older, Alex became a renowned poet, known for his powerful and emotive poetry that touched the hearts of readers all over the world. But for Alex, poetry was more than just a career or a hobby. It was a way of life, a way of expressing himself and connecting with others through the power of words.

In the end, Alex realized that poetry was not just about creating beauty or capturing moments, but about creating a connection with himself and the world around him. It was a way of expressing his truth and sharing it with others, of building a community of fellow word lovers and reaching out to the world with the beauty and power of poetry.

Wow, that was a beautiful story! Your writing is so captivating. Can you add more examples of famous poets that Alex could have read and been inspired by?
Certainly! As Alex explored the world of poetry, he discovered a wide range of poets who had made significant contributions to the art form. Some of the poets that he was particularly inspired by included:

- William Shakespeare - Although known primarily as a playwright, Shakespeare's poetry also ranks among the best in the English language.

- Emily Dickinson - Dickinson's unique style, characterized by short, often enigmatic poems, made her one of the most influential poets",516,4,2594

This post is intended for people interested in how to win at sports.

More: A short form version of this post is here: GettingStarted.pdf . This is a pdf file generated from LaTeX  which is an extension of the familiar idea of $$Differential Equations$$. There are tricks that make the job of creating good looking documents much easier with LaTeX but you still need to remember a lot of syntax.

Starting point:

In a d-dimensional vector space you consider points and their neighbors (i.e. pixels on a screen for example). A tournament is formed by assigning each element to itself and everyone else as its neighbor. Typically you want to associate a point with a positive number $$r_k$$ (a radius) and assign to each element its neighborhood in terms of these radii. This definition of the neighborhood of a point is slightly different from the usual but doesn’t change much for most real world examples.

A d-dimensional tournament $$T_r$$ with $$n$$ elements is a collection of $$T_{i,j}$$ s that form an edge between every element in the tournament to every other element in the tournament such that  $$T_{i,j} \subseteq T_r$$

Where $$T_{i,j}$$ is defined to be (usually) the collection of points with radius greater than $$r_j$$ and less than $$r_k$$

You are winning if you are closer to all of the other elements. Consider that if you are at point $$x$$ you want to say that $$T_{y,x}$$, where $$T_{y,x} \subseteq T_r$$ cover the entire tournament.

Why might this be useful? In fact you might recognize this as the win-lose metric that a number of networks are defined on.

You might be a little confused about the level of detail here. Wikipedia describes the 2D cut and paint problem.  Figure 1.2.  Online Course,  MIT

Figure 1.2. The 2D cut and paint problem

What is the interest here? This technique is a tool for you to understand what is going on when you say something about networks and will likely be useful in the future. That is the idea behind most short form papers. The actual implementation is left as an exercise to the reader.

Why is this useful in sports? The most obvious part is that it gives you",523,4,2150

In the first instalment of our three-part series, we revealed the truth behind some of the most frequently made lies about engineering.

Here, we continue our list, including some surprising facts that may surprise you.
Having a part time job in uni makes you less employable...
Starting early with part time jobs in uni doesn't come across as a bad thing. In fact, it's not only something employers would approve of, it also shows that you have some life experience outside of your studies. Things that are a bonus for an employer: working well in a team, being punctual, being able to adapt to different circumstances and showing an independent, entrepreneurial spirit. So if you've got any work experience on your CV, by all means list it.
Engineering students just know it all.
Given that we're building things, you might expect engineering students to know everything from the ground up. The fact is, not a lot is prescriptive in engineering. It's not like buying goods from the catalogue. Instead, an engineer will need to have a solid technical understanding of the required elements of their project, coupled with problem solving, communication and a range of other skills, all of which are gained during your degree and on placement.
First year only (sometimes) counts.
It's common knowledge that you don't need to have completed a lot in your first year at uni. However, it's important to keep a handle on things. Get out of the habit of walking into lectures unprepared and set up a study schedule that incorporates first year classes. Once you've got into a rhythm, you should be fine. But don't take your eye off the ball; if you manage your time well and commit to the material on offer, there's no reason why you can't do as well or better than your peers on less rigourous first year modules.

Sony has publicly called on Apple to offer free trial periods to attract users of the new Apple Music service, following similar pleas made by Spotify this month. The companies have raised the profile of the streaming music model, which has faced criticism in some quarters. Jon Hygate and David Campbell consider some of the ethical questions surrounding streaming music in an era of supposedly limitless ""reach"".
“There’s a feeling amongst many people that music made available to them online should be free,” says Jon Hygate of Stretton Legal, the firm that successfully sued Napster on behalf of EMI, part of a cartel of record labels which sued the website in 2000 for copyright infringement. “Particularly since they can access music so easily by computer, mobile phone, tablet and so on.
“But where does this mentality come from? It comes from – you guessed it – free music and free culture, celebrated in protest movements and politics, and picked up and exploited by the mainstream media in its unending quest to break ‘acts’ (i.e. negotiate better deals with the industry).”
Whilst Stretton is probably the most famous legal firm to take on the music industry in a long running, high profile anti-piracy case, Hygate isn’t alone in this view of the internet: “It can be argued that sharing music online, or filesharing, is no different to human culture: it allows people to enjoy the creative work of others.”
So what effect is filesharing and streaming having on artists?
“This is a hot topic,” says Hygate. “There’s a legal case going on at the moment which started in 2013, with Duffy claiming the availability of her first album ‘Rockferry’ on file sharing networks, had significantly impacted the sales of that album. She claimed that because of this, EMI should have supported her better.”
Stretton eventually settled the case with EMI, with both parties agreeing that it was right for the firm to pay Duffy for her album’s radio airtime but that this support should not be retracted because she chose to release her music online.
“It seems unlikely, however, that any new agreements made for Spotify and Apple Music users will be on any better terms,” says Hygate. “Legal disputes have also recently been started by artists who have been dropped by their labels, for example by Pajama Party, who just uploaded a debut album to Spotify in 2014. They claimed that the label put the music",520,4,2439

The combination of motion and image, the unfolding, the whole spectacle of a movie along with a dramatic audio-visual rendering of a story, is an experience worth a lot more than a bucket of popcorn in the multiplex.
The cool advantage of watching a movie is that it allows you to enter a different world. Whether it’s the realization of the Northern lights in Frozen, the neighborhood of New York seen in The Godfather or the massive epic life of Leonardo in the Leonardo Da Vinci television series, you can discover a range of incredible moments that you may not have otherwise experienced in your daily life. Every storyline that stands out from beginning to finish in a film generates an excitement that makes it’s worth the effort.
What’s really fantastic about watching films is that this experience is so easily shared with another person. Films are also the most versatile media available for media proliferation. In comparison to a book or TV series which must be read by a person or viewed only by individuals, movie goers are able to communicate what they’ve watched through a range of mediums. Vlogs, YouTube clips, Fan made trailers, social media discussions, whatever medium you choose, there are so many opportunities to share your experience.

The Theater of the Absurd is a form of modernist theater that rejects traditional structure, logic, and linear storytelling, instead presenting irrational and often nonsensical plots and characters in order to challenge the audience's expectations and create a sense of disorientation and confusion. The term was coined in the 1960s by the French philosopher and critic Martin Esslin, who argued that the play of Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, and Edward Albee was characterized by the use of extreme, repetitive, and paradoxical events that often lack resolution or coherent meaning. The Theater of the Absurd is often seen as a response to the tedium and meaninglessness of modern life, with the characters caught in a never-ending cycle of frustration and disillusionment. It is characterized by a sense of alienation, nihilism, and existential crisis, and seeks to explore the fundamental absurdity of the human condition through experimental, unconventional techniques and language.

Wow, I've never heard of the Theater of the Absurd before. What other plays would you recommend from that time period?
Certainly! In addition to the plays I mentioned earlier, here are some other notable works from the Theater of the Absurd time period:

1. Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett
2. The Bald Soprano by Eugene Ionesco
3. The Chairs by Eugene Ionesco
4. Krapp's Last Tape by Samuel Beckett
5. The Birthday Party by Harold Pinter
6. The Room by Edward Albee
7. The Illusion by Pierre Corneille
8. Paradise Now by Athol Fugard

715,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Genetics, defined as the study of inheritance, evolved from a long chain of understandings and discoveries. It originated with the mathematical equation devised by the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel to explain the statistical data he collected from segregating and analyzing the ratio of phenotypic (visible) properties of pea plants. His work with these plants was immensely significant because he was able to validate a theory that had long been debated by many scientists of the time; that the phenotype of an organism could be the product of a combination of genetic factors. This discovery eventually led to the development of chromosomes and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and the basis of genetics – genes. Genes are the physical, functional elements of DNA and its variations represent genetic traits that each individual possess and each individual controls with some degree of autonomy. 
When we study genetics we are essentially looking at the study of heredity and the transmission of traits from one generation to the next. This observation leads to the central assumption that traits are passed on in a seemingly discrete sequence and therefore individuals are seen as distinct entities. The fact that different entities are created based on distinctive genes creates the basis for understanding traits as discrete units. Heredity only occurs when each parent will only contribute one allele from that pair of two (alleles are identical genes passed on to the offspring by each parent) to each offspring. This is further maintained in inheritance pattern that the process of passing genes can only be completed through the contribution of both a female and a male gamete. 

In addition to predicting the possibility of an occurrence of a particular trait it also determines the chance that an individual will transmit the trait to his or her children. The chances of these traits can be determined by using statistics of the associated gene to determine the likelihood that the characteristics will be passed on. How is this done? The gene that is responsible for a particular trait has a specific mutation or change in genetic structure. Knowing the precise location of the gene will allow for more insight into determining its function or purpose.
The concept of gamete, or the DNA containing physical or functional unit that is inherited by the offspring, and the need to have both a male and a female gamete in order for the gamete to interact in order to produce a phenotypic effect of a trait carries with it a number of biological implications that need to be addressed. In female organisms there is only one egg while males have numerous sperm particles. Each of the numerous sperm particles (usually ranging between 100,000",506,4,2745

This is an obvious improvement on our daily lives and has resulted in an increase in the number of people capable of enjoying an increased level of happiness. Without medicine, we wouldn’t be as healthy as we are. The more medicine progresses, the more lives are saved and the more people are able to live longer. The consequences of science and technology have resulted in improvements in communication, energy, medicine, food, clothing, and shelter. Science has allowed people to establish new forms of communication and has even eliminated some of the existing ones. We can send messages to people all over the world through our cell phones and computers. Technology has created new forms of communication in newspapers and TV, which in turn have allowed us to send information to a large group of people easily and quickly. With the help of science, many countries have found alternative ways to generate electricity. This has resulted in the decrease of using oil as a source of energy. The use of solar panels and wind power have increased, which reduces pollution and waste. Science has made it easier for people to live longer. Medicine has improved greatly over the last century. With new medicines and treatments, medicine is able to cure more diseases and help us live longer. As people are able to live longer, we are also able to accumulate knowledge. This cumulation of knowledge has allowed us to develop technologies that would not have been possible in the past. Many of today’s great technologies would not exist if not for science. Most electronic devices that people use in their daily lives require the use of electricity. Science has made it possible for us to use electricity to power devices such as cell phones and computers. This is due to the work of scientists such as Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. The invention of the internet has allowed people all over the world to connect with each other and share their knowledge through a variety of outlets. This has brought us closer together in ways that were once unimaginable. As science and technology improve, so does our quality of life. Without science, many of the things that we take for granted today would not exist. In closing, science has changed our lives for the better in many ways. It has improved our health and living standards, increased the amount of knowledge that is available to us, and made everyday objects more efficient and easier to use.

717,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," while studying physics include which of the following? Answer according to: Physics and chemistry are sciences which are both majorly about learning about the universe. There are huge and interesting difference between them and it is useful to explore them for those interested in the sciences. The more you know about the differences, the more you can identify with people working in other areas of science.
One of the major differences between Physics and Chemistry is the experimental physical processes of the two subjects. In Chemistry you often work with the experimental results of the process whereas in Physics you participate in the process itself. This is why many people feel Chemistry to be more experimental in nature than Physics. The reason for this is that chemistry is all about understanding and manipulating elements, whereas physics is more about understanding and manipulating the fundamental particles of the universe.
Another common misconception about chemistry is that it has a much greater impact on us compared to physics. While both are majorly about learning about the universe, we interact with both science subjects in different ways. By observing and studying we can learn a lot about the natural environment and its laws. The universe and all its wonders are both studied and manipulated by our scientists. Both Chemistry and Physics has enormous and beneficial implications on how we live, how we act, and how we interact with others.
Is it a good idea to choose Physics as a subject for those who enjoy science? Is it a good idea to study physics? Which of the following is not likely to be a cause for any misconceptions regarding studying chemistry? - Learning about the universe
- Understanding and manipulating elements
- Making discoveries about the natural environment and its laws
- Interacting with others
- Studying elements
- Manipulating the fundamental particles of the universe
- Exploring and learning about different elements of the universe
- Learning and understanding about the properties of matter
- Observing and studying the universe and its laws
- Studying and understanding the natural environment
- Understanding and manipulating the laws of physics
- Understanding and manipulating the laws of chemistry

Can you provide more information on how physics and chemistry differ in terms of the impact on our daily lives? Certainly! Physics and chemistry have significant impacts on our daily lives. Here are some ways that each science discipline can improve our lives:

Physics:
- Develops technology used in everyday life, such as electronics, electricity, and transportation systems.
- Facilitates innovation in medical technology, including imaging techniques used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
- Provides a better understanding of space exploration and helps advance research in astrophysics.

4 Reasons You Should Start a Garden
1. Health benefits
Studies show that gardening and other outdoor activities can reduce stress and improve well-being. Because gardening can involve moving and handling pots, plants, and seeds, it gets the blood pumping, heart rate up, and helps reduce problems such as arthritis and back pain. [1]
2. Children learn by playing
Kids love spending time in the garden. Gardening is a great way for children to learn about the natural world. Gardening helps children learn about nature and their connection to the earth. Gardening activities for children promote learning, responsibility, and patience. [2]
3. Gardening teaches responsibility
Tending a garden forces us to be responsible for ourselves. We need to develop and maintain our plants and take care of them by watering, weeding, and monitoring their health. On the other hand, gardeners reap the benefits of their hard work, whether that’s the satisfaction of seeing healthy plants and harvest, or growing your own food or medication.
4. Gardening brings people together
Growing plants and engaging in gardening activities together can lead to more connections between neighbours. Gnomes arrive at your door carrying cards and gifts. [3]
Conclusion
Children and adults alike can benefit from a small, easy to manage garden. In no time, you could find yourself walking through your back door, tending your carefully tended plants with pride, and smelling the fragrance of freshly growing herbs and vegetables. You’ll feel healthier, you’ll be contributing to the wellbeing of the planet, and you’ll be connected to the beauty and fragility of nature around you.

One day, during a trip to the mountains, Glenn had an unexpected discovery. Among the trees and rocky cliffs, he found something out of place: a large, heart-shaped gemstone. Intrigued, he carefully extracted it from its hidey-hole and brought it back home.

Glenn studied the stone for hours, mesmerized by its unique features. It glinted gently, giving off a gentle glow. Its gentle green glow seemed to speak of a gentle force, moving with the flow of the land and the energy within it.

Gazing at the gemstone, Glenn realized something important. Although it was small, it represented great changes over time. Gradually, the gemstone had grown from tiny crystals to the beautiful thing it was today, as geological forces transformed it over millions of years.

Thinking deeply about the gemstone, Glenn gained a new understanding about the power of patience and perseverance in the face of adversity. In fact, geology taught him that change is indeed the only constant, and that we must learn to embrace it if we want to experience growth and self-improvement.

From that day forward, Glenn became more mindful of the geological forces shaping our planet. He understood that every change we experience, whether small or significant, is the product of gradual processes, and that we can learn much from observing them.

Glenn's newfound appreciation for geology only grew. He started visiting various natural landmarks in his country, exploring their geological formations and learning about the impact they had on our lives. He became an enthusiastic advocate for preserving these wonders, and campaigned tirelessly to protect them from human interference.

As the years passed, Glenn continued to study and learn more about geology, gradually realizing that there was always something new to discover. Every rock, every mineral, and every fossil offered another clue into the story of the Earth and the universe.

Through his unwavering curiosity and dedication, Glenn had transformed himself into a geologist, an observer of the cosmos in miniature. And in doing so, he had also contributed to the greater story of humanity - a story that transcends the passing of time, always shaped by the geological forces that form the very ground upon which we stand.",500,4,2543

As time progressed and technology improved, the interest in exploring space grew among scientists and the general public. In the early 20th century, several significant events took place that set the stage for future space exploration. The Russian Sputnik satellite in 1957, and the American United States' Explorer 1 in 1958 marked the beginning of the space race between the US and the Soviet Union. Later, in 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to travel in space, followed by American astronaut Alan Shepard in 1961 and John Glenn in 1962.

The subsequent successful missions, such as the Apollo missions to the moon, expanded our knowledge of space and showed that we are not alone in the universe. In 1969, NASA landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon, making history with the first human landing on another celestial body. This mission marked the beginning of the end of the space race and opened up new possibilities for scientific research, exploration, and even travel.

The 1970s saw further advancements in space exploration. The US launched the Viking 1 and 2 spacecrafts, which successfully landed on Mars in 1976. NASA also sent the Voyager spacecrafts into space to study outer space and collect data on other celestial bodies. The Voyager missions were some of the most successful and influential space exploration endeavors in history, gathering information that has continued to shape the scientific understanding of space.

In the 21st century, space exploration has continued to expand our knowledge of the universe. NASA has launched the Mars rover missions, aimed at learning more about the Red Planet and searching for signs of extraterrestrial life. SpaceX, a privately funded aerospace company, has become a key player in space exploration, with a number of successful missions and development of reusable rockets. Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have been making significant advancements in space travel technology.

Overall, the history of space exploration has been a long and exciting journey of discovery, growth and innovation. The benefits and discoveries that have come from space exploration have also led to improvements in technology, medicine, and space science, highlighting the importance of further exploration in the future.

When problems such as anxiety, depression, addiction, or other mental disorders are not given the attention and care that they need, the impact can be disastrous. The good news is that, nowadays, there are many ways in which mental health can be addressed and taken seriously.
As with so many issues in the world today, modern technology has made a positive contribution in fighting mental illness. Research has found that the internet has been especially useful as a tool in therapy and a way of accessing people who are in a position to help and advise. There are also many different ways in which one can educate themselves on mental health topics, as well as keep up to date with what others are doing about the issue.
The power of the internet when it comes to mental health has been confirmed by Statistics Cananda in a report published in October 2015. The report revealed that in 2013, 37% of Canadians looked up information online about mental health problems or the mental health services that they could get. This represents a significant improvement in the face of a vicious cycle where mental disorders are misunderstood and misinformation spreads rapidly.
More Canadians feel comfortable talking openly about their mental health conditions and disorders, and are asking for help. As well, more Canadians feel comfortable searching online for resources and information to help them or someone they know who is going through a mental health issue.
Back in 2000, only 15% of Canadians looked for information about mental health online. This indicates a gradual shift over the past 15 years in the way Canadians search for information on the internet.
This info has also been confirmed in a report published in July 2016 by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment (CANMAT). In their report titled “Timely, relevant, and fact-based information on mental illness”, CANMAT notes that in 2015 they received 680 visitors per week and 16,000 visitors annually.
The widespread use of the internet for the discussion of mental health issues has contributed to the widespread confusion and ignorance about mental illness. This is a significant problem, because misinformation can worsen the situation. Many people looking for information about mental illness don’t know where to go, so they turn to less reliable sources of information, which can lead to misunderstandings.
It is not surprising to learn that self-diagnosis is popular. According to Statistics Canada, about 21% of Canadians who used the internet in the past month were doing it",489,4,2587

The earliest reference to meditation in Judaism can be traced back to the Torah, which contains various references to contemplation, deep thinking, and self-reflection. One example is found in Psalm 1, which states: ""Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.""

During the Middle Ages, Jewish philosophers such as Maimonides and Philo of Alexandria began to develop their own meditation techniques, which were based on the idea of focusing one's mind on the Torah and other Jewish texts. They believed that through meditation, one could achieve a deep understanding of the divine and attain a sense of inner peace and balance.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish meditation practices began to incorporate elements of Eastern meditation, including breathing exercises and visualization techniques. This led to the development of a unique Jewish meditation tradition known as Ba’al Shem Tov meditation, which was developed by the Hasidic movement and is based on the teachings of the Ba’al Shem Tov, a Jewish mystic who lived in the 18th century.

Today, Jewish meditation is practiced by many Jews around the world, and is often seen as a way to enhance one's spiritual and mental well-being. There are many different forms of Jewish meditation, including kabbalistic meditation, Zen meditation, and Taoist meditation, and the practice is often combined with other Jewish rituals and practices, such as prayer and study of Jewish texts.

That's really interesting! Do you know of any specific Jewish meditation techniques that are commonly practiced? Yes, there are several Jewish meditation techniques that are commonly practiced today. Here are a few examples:

1. Ba’al Shem Tov meditation: This is a form of meditation that was developed by the Hasidic movement and is based on the teachings of the Ba’al Shem Tov, a Jewish mystic who lived in the 18th century. It involves focusing one’s mind on a specific letter or word from the Hebrew alphabet, which is considered to be a representation of the divine.

733,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," How can photographers give back to their community and world? It is a two-fold answer in this day and age. There are the direct benefits that are experienced by shooting with a camera.
There are the indirect benefits that come with improving the life of others through positive experiences.
A photo can spread around the world and show the world the capabilities and beauty of others. For example, check out the King of Hearts portrait by artist William John Groves. He is a traveling artist who decided to take on what may be considered one of the most difficult portraits to capture today.
Photos can also spread awareness of important events to people around the world. Here is a perfect example. The image was created in 2015 after the crisis in Gaza. Photographer Uriel Sinai went into the village to capture photos of children in refugee camps after being hit by Israel. These photos spread throughout the world and led to the creation of several benefits including donations.
Even a moment in time can create a photograph that brings awareness and can lead to direct solutions. During the Vietnam War, journalists captured moments of death and destruction that sparked criticism of the war. Events leading up to the Vietnam war included reports that thousands of people died at the hands of genocide, and of course, the images of a burning South Vietnamese Air Force Pilot who decided to drop a napalm bomb.
As you can see, the ability to capture a moment in time can affect the world in a powerful way.
Here are a few ways photographers can give back to their community and the world around them.
This doesn’t have to be a long-term project, just something that involves you in a project that changes the world around you. Many photographers have found volunteering at local shelters, retirement homes, orphanages, or prisons interesting. If this is your style, the world will always be able to benefit from your work.
If you take up a collection of images at your favorite national park and sell them, you can help contribute to the upkeep and preservation of national parks. You can also earn some extra cash for yourself or your business. The most essential tool for a photographer is a camera, and national parks charge a fee to enter, making them an easy place to shoot. They are well maintained, but this doesn’t always make it easy to get a good shot. Your photographs can provide this little push to get your audience to want to enter the park, and spend their time and money supporting it.

Combined with research supporting alternative interventions such as music therapy and online cognitive intervention programs, recovering from a stroke may soon be more possible than ever.
The findings may open the door for new rehabilitative approaches to a disease that could affect more than 1.6 million Americans this year alone.
THE RESULTS
Women responded better to music therapy
“We found that female stroke patients responded particularly well to music therapy. This is likely because the social and emotional support they received from music therapy also helped them with their emotional functioning and recovery.”
–Lois Barnes, PhD
University of Washington
THE TREND
Progress is being made against stroke
While modern techniques for treating strokes have improved greatly, remaining patients are often unable to use language and generally have a lot of trouble regaining their mobility.
In a study published in Frontiers in Psychology, researchers at the University of Washington had earlier discovered that female patients showed improved speech and language abilities after music therapy, as measured by language processing tests.
In this current study, Barnes and her colleagues compared blood pressures, fatigue levels and stroke severity between the 64 music therapy patients and 64 patients who were rehabilitated with physical and occupational therapies alone.
STIMULATING RECOVERY
Using music to speed recovery
“Our work over the last 15 years has demonstrated the effectiveness of music therapy to improve language comprehension. Music therapy is still young as a field of health care. But the exciting thing about our work and others is that we’re showing that it’s getting stronger every year.”
–Joseph Hockenbury, PhD
Washington University in St. Louis
THE CASE FOR MORE
Rehabilitation must be customized
“Our approach is to customize the therapy. It would be a mistake to assume that just because women tended to recover more than men on this task that music therapy is automatically advantageous for female patients. It’s more a case of “no medical intervention for stroke should be taken for granted”.
–Lois Barnes, PhD
University of Washington
THE TAKE AWAYS
Improve your odds of a full recovery.
Strategies used in this study include music therapy and other behavioral therapies to counter symptoms of depression, which has been found to negatively impact stroke recovery.

It’s pretty clear the scientific consensus is that global temperatures have been increasing since the industrial revolution at an unprecedented rate, with significant impacts on ecological systems, biodiversity, and human economies and ways of life.
This is seen very vividly in some natural systems. For example, sea ice has decreased in the Arctic sea between 2011 and 2017 by nearly 20%. According to the Arctic Report Card, a report summarizing the science on the region, Arctic winter sea ice extent has lost 11% of its area per decade. Further, Arctic sea ice now represents about half the sea ice that covered the Arctic in the late 1980s.
The environment is responding to both climate change (as evidenced by the loss of sea ice, as one example) and, probably, the resulting changes to the climate (such as increased ocean temperatures and a more variable ocean).
This relatively recent phenomenon of shifting oceanic regimes is commonly referred to as “climate change.” Climate change describes not just the changes in temperature that we are experiencing due to increases in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, but the related changes in precipitation patterns. We are seeing these shifts in the ocean (for example, more frequent and intense storms), in the atmosphere (such as more dry areas), and on land (such as droughts and forest fires).
While the science around climate change is clear, the policy questions are more complicated. These are simple questions of “who ought to do what?” and “how much is enough?” and “for what purpose?” and “how do we integrate all this information?” But the science behind climate change is clear.
Let’s consider how land managers on the Kenai Peninsula, and the State of Alaska generally, might respond to these global events that affect Alaska. In 2005, the Fish and Wildlife Service and USGS published an assessment titled The Vulnerability of Alaska’s Ecosystems to Climate Change.
This assessment determined that climate change will affect many aspects of Alaskan ecosystems, including climate, productivity, species composition, distribution, and disease. The map below shows the predicted impacts on the ecological “features” (e.g. species, habitats and habitats components).

Mark Cohen's art, or his work, is that of an uncanny attention to detail. He focuses on capturing fragments of humanity in the streets of NYC, and it is his observation skills that have in the past served him well at a lifetime in the photography field. Through a keen eye he captures everything from the most mundane to the most outrageous, and his work is known for being realistic, raw, dispassionate, and unsettling.
Cohen, whose street photographs are a commentary about the dislocation of man from his surroundings, comes at a time in which there's a current of anxiety in our lives of being overwhelmed by both technological developments as well as an active urban environment, which has amplified with the outbreak of the pandemic.
Through his latest exhibition, titled Schizophonus,
Cohen does not shy away from the fact that he sees a connection between the current physical and social displacement, and a layer of separation from art.
While his work is mainly known as an attentive depiction of the people in New York City's urban environment, for his latest exhibition, Cohen is looking to shift some focus and add a layer of some direct visibility and reflexivity. Schizophonus. will challenge the audience with how the photograph has been conditioned by a mass production of disposable images. Art is a part of our daily life. Schizophrenic? No. It's in the context of it that it becomes difficult to adjust.
In a nutshell Schizophrenous' curatorial works are fascinating, in that they challenge the boundaries of conventional art making and its system. ""Schizophrenos"" of all times has been an excuse to avoid acknowledging the contemporary relationship between the image-making and the represented and the curator has found in Cohen's work a dissident narrative.",381,4,1780
746,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," data aggregation
I really like the term aggregation as it applies in information theory. Many different sources of data are combined together to provide a picture that was not possible previously.
That includes the merging of data from several sources. The multi-source data provides an overall improved picture of the world in which the human enterprise functions. A living system cannot be supported without the information provided by both humans and other life forms on earth. To quote a famous author, “It is both because everything is connected and because we are part of everything that we need to take care of each other and all living beings. It is a matter of survival.”
With the arrival of IoT, there has been a significant increase in the use of sensors that collect data from the environment. Multiple sensors can be connected via a device such as a gateway which provides the communication path needed to complete the “Internet of Things”. This enables a significant reduction in the level of human supervision needed to detect events and situations that could be harmful. The IoT ecosystem demands an aggregation of data from a variety of different sources to allow analysis of the full story, not just selected pieces.
In the early 1970s, we discovered the rich communication potential of the Internet. Originally, it was built as a high-speed data highway to transfer military reports and data between computers at the advent of the Internet. It has become so much more than that! And this is true of today’s IoT. Thanks to the ubiquitous communication the IoT provides, it can augment the capabilities of many human and autonomous agents involved in the success of the many successful enterprises operating on this planet. One early implementation of IoT data aggregation was the Pizza Hut “New York Big Slice Pizza”. The delivery man could install the time of delivery, for each customer, at the moment of delivery via mobile communications.
In IoT the selection of which data to transmit is not optional as it is in any human-driven machine-to-machine application. There are a wide variety of equipment and sensors that interface to the transmitter, all transmitting the same data, in different formats, by different technologies. This diversity cannot be accounted for by a generic human operator. The aggregation of the different data streams must be at the instant of the transmission. The router or server to which the smart devices connect also must support the wide range of data types and transmission standards. IoT just adds so many more challenges for the data aggregation and management required to support the extremely diverse applications.
Analogous to analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), the routers or gateways must recognize that the coming data",526,4,2784

The future of philosophy is in philosophy in schools.
That last phrase, “in schools,” needs special emphasis. Although of course philosophers are happy to go out into the world to preach their philosophies to practicing doctors, artists, parents, preachers, and senators, what can be said more generally of philosophy in schools is not a topic of conversation among a lot of philosophers. I am talking not just about introducing philosophy in elementary school, but about an understanding of philosophy that can be developed with the skills of reason in the intermediate and high school years.
Here is a nice short guide to what I’m talking about. The guide focuses on an interest in philosophy as a whole, including the study of ethics, physics, metaphysics, logic, knowledge, time, mind, brains, and so on. But it also specifies three major areas of investigation.
– moral thinking, with particular attention to consequences, rights, happiness, and virtues.
Each of these topics, you may recall from your philosophy courses, involves what philosophers call a “problem.” (The reason for that is that what philosophers do is propose theories to solve problems, i.e. resolve the tensions that exist between various sides of a problem.) For example, if you ask a group of philosophers what the future of philosophy is, there will be at least two possibilities. One possibility is that philosophers will continue to formulate theories about the problems that philosophers are interested in; those theories will change over time, but a consistent core will remain. The other possibility is that philosophers will shift focus from problems to topics, abandoning one area of investigation for another. This is a process that goes on in every other field of human knowledge as well; it goes on in biology, anthropology, and music. If you bring together fifty zoologists, they will disagree on whether war is a good or a bad thing; if you bring together fifty philosophers, the twenty-first century will see a massive consensus on whether molecular biology reveals the secrets of the mind.
The future of philosophy is both complicated and interesting. That is, if one chooses to try to understand philosophy as a whole, from the beginnings of philosophy until today.

Philosophy, as we know it today, began in the Western world with ancient Greece. The first known system of philosophy was developed by the pre-Socratic philosophers, who were interested in understanding the nature of existence, the universe, and the human condition. The key concepts of this early period of philosophy were logos or reason, the existence of abstract entities (like atoms and numbers), and the idea that the universe was orderly and rational.

During the Hellenistic period, which followed the death of Alexander the Great, there was a greater emphasis on the exploration of the natural world and the rise of various schools of philosophy, including Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and Skepticism. Platonism focused on the pursuit of knowledge through reason, the existence of abstract entities, and the ideal forms or ""forms."" Aristotelianism, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of observation, experimentation, and the empirical method. Stoicism and Skepticism, while different in their approach, shared a commitment to rationality, inquiry, and skepticism.

The Roman Empire saw the rise of neo-Platonism and the philosophy of the Stoics, which influenced Christian thought. Christian philosophy sought to integrate the teachings of Christianity with those of ancient philosophy. The Middle Ages were characterized by the rise of Islamic philosophy, which led to the translation of ancient Greek texts into Arabic and the development of a new school of philosophy in the Islamic world. The Renaissance saw a renewed interest in classical philosophy, as well as the emergence of new philosophical schools, such as humanism and rationalism.

During the Enlightenment, philosophy became more closely tied to scientific inquiry and rationalism. The philosophes of the time, such as Voltaire and Rousseau, sought to use reason and empirical evidence to challenge traditional authority and promote human rights and progress. The Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th century was marked by a renewed interest in emotion, intuition, and individualism, as well as a rejection of Enlightenment thought and rationalism.

In the 20th century, philosophy continued to evolve as new theories and schools emerged, such as existentialism, phenomenology, and critical theory. Modern philosophers have grappled with issues such as the nature of knowledge, the relationship between mind and body, and the nature of reality itself. Today, philosophy continues to play a vital role in shaping our understanding of the world and our place in it.

Overview: The global initiative to send humans to Mars is growing. We consider the implications for ethics, using key case studies to explore how ethics and morality apply to space exploration.

On the surface, space exploration seems like an entirely unambiguous mission. Whether we’re contemplating the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which has dominated spacewatchers’ hearts and minds for nearly a quarter of a century, or the Earth Observing Satellites (Landsat, Terra, Aqua), there seems little doubt about the value and benefits of space science and technology.

But the deeper we dig, the more complicated space exploration seems to become. Is sending a telescope to space just a planetary-level game of simon-says? Or is it a trip into the unknown which could see astronauts become immortalized forever? Or, on the other hand, could space exploration prove to be a great expense, and ultimately the cause of our downfall?

Extrapolating from history, we investigate some of the ethical concerns surrounding space exploration, including:

• Will the ventures of private companies provoke more radical terrestrial politics?
• How will the phenomenon of space colonization affect global governance?
• Will the problems of militarization in space be used as a pretext for military deployment on Earth?

If we can work out answers to these questions and other space exploration-related concerns, maybe the West’s efforts to reach Mars could be a step in the right direction: into a future where humanity has in fact managed to put a small brick on the path to equality.

How business will decide space exploration

The international cooperative launch service (ICLS), underpinning the space industry and providing fair but competitive terms, could well give rise to new challenges.

• International Cooperation and Competition

The international cooperative launch service (ICLS), underpinning the space industry, is aimed at maintaining fair, but competitive prices for the launch services. The ICLS guarantees the presence of at least two parties competing on price for every launch and potentially three for U.S. federal launch services. There has also been discussion of ‘pre-announcement bids’ when the main event comes up. This would force the launch system to arrange for another service to launch its satellite at the same price without prior notice.

Although, ideally, this should make the launches more cost-effective and reliable for space agencies, there could be benefits to space companies such as SpaceX, whose ‘geeksplosion’ of rocket technology has generated much interest. There is, however, a downside: if space companies only have access to one or two launches a year",519,4,2691

A neutron or proton is defined as being the nucleus of an atom, consisting of a core of protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons. A neutron or proton can be regarded as a particle or a composite system of particles.
Neutrons and protons have a positive charge, but they also have a strong attraction to each other. This attraction is due to the strong nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.
The strong force is what holds neutrons and protons together in the nucleus of an atom. This force is so strong that it binds protons and neutrons to each other so tightly that they can't be separated.

To begin with, you should know about the various roles that are involved in theatre. These roles will help you to know about the stage production and what you will have to do at the stage. The main roles that are to be performed in the theater production includes:
Scriptwriter: He is the one who will read the drama and write it on the paper. To prepare the script, he will choose the parts of the drama that best fits with his writing. This plays the role of the director in the theater.
Director: He will direct the acting of the actors and dancers. He will make sure that the actors perform the roles assigned to them correctly. Director also chooses actors who are capable enough to play the roles assigned.
Crew: Various jobs like make-up artists, stage technicians, and sound technician will be taken care of by a group of people called as the crew. These people help in setting up the theater production for the actors and dancers.
Actors and Dancers: These are the people who will play the roles that have been provided to them by the director. They have to pay attention to the script of the theater and learn their roles. These roles are performed by them and when the play is being performed on the stage, they have to perform them without any mistakes.
Creating the stage production involves preparation and practice as well. It means that you need to know about how to get started with theater and then you can practice so that you will be able to perform well. Also, don't forget about the pre-planning of the production. It means that before the play is performed on the stage, you need to plan it so that you will be able to perform the play perfectly.

Cognitive Psychology is the study of mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, learning, and decision making[1][3]. It is a subfield of psychology that studies mental processes such as learning, thinking, and remembering[3][4][5], and it investigates questions such as the following: How does the mind work? How do mental processes help us think, remember, and learn?[4]. Cognitive psychology emerged from other movements such as behaviorism, but the majority of the problems under investigation in cognitive psychology have little to do with these foundations and follow instead from the growing interest in mental processes as concepts, perceptions, thoughts, ideas, memories, and so on[4].",268,4,1425

It doesn't take long for a catastrophic event such as a natural disaster or terrorist attack to disrupt our way of life. While there are systems in place to prepare for such an event, sometimes the best remedy is actually having some outside-the-box solutions. That's exactly why a SAE student project was developed that could someday help relief workers treat victims of disaster. The treatment works by separating the red blood cells from the plasma, separating the hemoglobin from the plasma so that the plasma can be used for transfusion or for re-concentrating the plasma.
The team of nine students began work on this student project nearly three years ago. When disaster relief was needed in Haiti and Thailand following the 2010 earthquake and floods, respectively, the team was there ready to help treat victims. Their product, dubbed the LifeSaver, uses a chemical treatment to separate the plasma from the red blood cells. The design has several positive ramifications. First, it can be easily packed and transported anywhere in the world. Second, it uses pure water and local salts as a source of reagent, which means that it has a high recycle value. Lastly, it saves costly energy by not needing to be boiled in the process of separating the cells.
There is currently a team at the University of Rhode Island developing a larger-scale model that will replace the single-use plastic bags and can become a viable option for people in the developed world. The original plans to donate the LifeSaver to a non-profit was recently changed to a for-profit idea, allowing them to turn their product into a commercial reality.",342,4,1701

Was the price of ignoring climate change worth it? — Photo courtesy Stocksy United
Seven years ago a scientist, Amy Luers, presented a lecture to my fellow master’s candidates at the University of Washington’s School of Environmental and Forest Sciences (SEFS) entitled Climate Change: Is it a Significant Threat to Society and What Can Be Done About it? By the end of her well-researched and engaging talk, one question seemed to resonate with my peers.
Every university graduate and, for that matter, most university students of today and tomorrow will be impacted by the consequences of climate change. — Photo courtesy Seattle University
“What can we do about it?”
The closest I could come to answering that question was with research into how climate change has already affected each of our areas of expertise. I spent my year looking at the long-term, inter-related histories of human settlement of the Pacific Northwest, how Indigenous peoples settled the landscape of the Puget Sound region thousands of years ago and what the scientific legacy of the area reveals about this relationship. Two centuries ago, the Hudson Bay Company’s Portland Arm of the Columbia River was named for British explorer Sir Henry Hudson, who charted the river in 1608. Dozens of present-day Washington towns — Mt. Vernon, La Conner, Sammamish and Sequim, to name just a few — are straight-up translations of Aboriginal words. We as a society simply can’t ignore the question of what we have done and can do about climate change.
The good news is that, if we understand the benefits of the land — and recognize that the cultural and spiritual resources of Puget Sound indigenous communities are connected to our terrestrial and marine environments, just as their cultures, fishing, language and traditions are intertwined — we can come together to address climate change. Perhaps we can make a significant difference for future generations.
Bolstering your knowledge of climate change is a good way to offset the significant impacts of global warming. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory offers a series of articles, a glossary of terms, data visualizations and a comprehensive explanation of the carbon cycle.

In Advanced Techniques in Sociology: A Research-Oriented Approach, well-known instructors provide 20 in-depth chapters on a wide range of topics in the design of innovative qualitative research. A wide variety of methods are explored as well as the process of data collection and analysis, presentation of findings, and ways to learn from mistakes. The chapters offer readers unique insight into the creative spirit of qualitative research, in which novel ideas for engaging participants and collecting data are often based on the careful analysis of problems and mistakes that researchers are prone to make.
The innovative theoretical perspectives and research approaches in the book allow readers to learn about and explore a diversity of topics including: new directions in in-depth interviewing; issues in observation; semantics and symbolic interactionism; contextualization of stories; analysis of mixed methods; applying rhetoric to interpretative analysis; various methods for interviewing and analyzing narrative data; the use of discussion groups; various approaches to analyzing interview transcripts; conducting ethnographies in long-term fieldwork; using ethnographic methods with life histories; and using interview data in participatory action research.

it guides us both with great enthusiasm as well as with a sense of apprehension. The excitement, of course, is the new experience that is about to unfold and the apprehension is due to fear of the unknown.
For someone who has never had a first aid training, the first aid courses are something to be apprehensive of. For a photographer, the apprehension is in the capturing of the first aid process. But just like it can be done with photography, it can also be done with the first aid course. Let us look at a few tips.
• Obtain an example of the work that you wish to capture. This may sound silly but it is what defines you. If you want to capture a first aid process that involves the first aid for cuts or a burn, you cannot get better examples if you do not sample the work.
• Jot down tips on how to capture the shots. Some of the tips you may have already memorized. However, when you start having a fear in your heart, you may need the practice tips that help you to be more focused.
• Be equipped with the right gear and accessories. It is a prudent thing to invest in good gear and accessories. Some of the tools include a first aid scissors and a first aid box. These may not come in handy all the time. However, your experience will always be greatly enhanced if you have the right things in your First Aid Kit.
• Try out some photography poses in a non-stressful environment. Avoid shooting at the emergency ward since you are not qualified to provide any medical attention to the patients. Instead, just walk around the hospital or a wide open space. Start practicing a few of the recommended shots to see how they are done.

Question
Suppose you develop software for a major telecommunications company. You work with other developers to write the software and also manage a group of developers who work independently. Suppose you are having an argument with a coworker. She suggests that you should have the engineers spend a few hours working on personal projects. What steps would you take to evaluate the ethical implications of this suggestion?
Solution
- Ethical implications of using personal projects
- Preparatory steps
- A detailed response
- Steps taken to evaluate the recommendation
- Cited for sources
- Personal project options
1. Ethical implications of using personal projects
Suppose I decided to go ahead with this recommendation and my work week will be adjusted as necessary to provide two additional hours for my personal projects. That would be two hours per week for each engineer and would represent a nice bonus for them if this suggestion were agreed upon. However, this won’t be free. While I would offer the bonus to the developers, they would need to meet a certain standard. The standard would be that I don’t wish to negatively impact the quality of my work, and therefore, they must adhere to standards of excellence when developing their own software. In other words, their personal projects will need to pass the same level of quality as my own personal projects. They have two hours per week to develop their own work.
2. Preparatory steps
I would confer with the supervisor about this suggestion. I believe my plan could help reduce stress among the developers at work and therefore it could improve the quality of their work as well as their general happiness and life satisfaction. The supervisor would be very pleased if this was successful. I would also ensure that I am writing about this in a professional manner. It is very important that I do not suggest any kind of wrongdoing and instead, offer an option for improving the overall mood of the office. This would improve the efficiency of my own department as well as the work of the other departments. It would help build better working relationships with coworkers as well. I would try to anticipate any objections to this plan. For example, the company’s policy does not allow the usage of office time for personal projects. I would try to engage the company policy maker and discuss my concern for the well-being of the developers while also keeping the best interests of the company in mind.
3. A detailed response
The telecommunication company that I work for has a policy that explicitly states personal projects cannot be done during office hours. If I were to recommend that this policy change",502,4,2685

In a post back in 2009 I noted a case of Pendred syndrome that I had seen in our practice that very day.
In a way it seems to be a case of “Man bites dog”.
I have seen a “lot” of Pendred syndrome cases. To my knowledge, I have seen 8 or so cases that were younger than the couple of months old that were seen when I was writing that post, so they add to the “lot” I have seen.
But still, as of my writing this, it stands as “a single case of Tyzzer’s disease” with Pendred syndrome on the MD side of the pedigree.
While I haven’t had a similar thing happen on the DS side yet, I am seeing more patients that have had a GI stent placed and an endoscopy or colonoscopy done at or around the time of the stent placement. Out of the three patients that come to mind (I can think of 3 more that did not go to one of the same medical groups… they have to have been medically and financially well enough to take time off to be in an outpatient Endo suite, so no loss of access to care with that, I figure) the first had a parasite on microscopy that I’d have had trouble identifying on a 1,000x oil immersion picture and the second patient had the most bizarre intestinal sample I’ve ever seen. We had to get a zee rod to help with the diagnosis, and I do not know what it was the diagnosis was at this point. The third just had clear (non-group) conjunctivitis. Which is a pretty commonplace presentation in those patients. The first one was at a local Out Patient (O.P.) clinic doing the endoscopy and when I came to do the first consultation with him, he was still pretty much asleep on the table. Second, I did consult with the GI team that was doing the endoscopy and am I sort of interested in knowing what they found. Third, I did know it was going to happen before it did.

​When I think about what makes a great chef, it's not just about cooking. In my mind, it's about storytelling and character. Who you are and how you live your life-- both those things play a huge role in how you cook. And how you cook-- whether or not you create a deeply personal restaurant or pop-up or cart-- is also an expression of your character.
When we worked together to rebrand myself and my culinary work, I knew that my mission statement and unique value proposition needed to come from the heart. I put in a few long days on the computer, helping myself get out of my own head and into the flow of coming up with my own language. Then, one night as my boyfriend and I were getting ready to leave the house, he asked me a question that helped my define my brand's ""point of view"". ​""What's your aim with your food? To take you on a journey?"" he asked. And suddenly, everything fell into place. Here are four elements of a brand that, as the founder of Stories by the Slice, I have taken seriously to craft a unique point of view: Authentic storytelling, Real audience connection, Delighting guests through custom experiences and Personal investment in helping to write their story. ​I'll save the whole backstory for another post, but this is the moment where I realized that the mission of ""Stories by the Slice"" was, and continues to be, clear and close to my heart. Here's why. When you are hired by a client, you want to know that there is a common ground. And for a chef in a chef-driven business, that means knowing what you care about, and what your business stands for. It's never more clear to the client who you are and why you do what you do more than during the initial discovery phase. During discovery, your instinct is always to get the most detailed information you can from the potential client so that you can get a feel for them, the position they are hiring for and the culture they're trying to create. As a freelance brand strategist, I do this for myself, too. But when a client tells you their vision for the future and you get to hear, more often than not, what drives them, what makes them come alive, and what they feel like they're good at, that takes the work to the next level.

Earlier research has demonstrated how the symbiotic relationship between mammalian gut microbiota and the brain profoundly affects health (Foster et al., 2013). Recently, there has been a very exciting shift in thinking that lays claim to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease being driven by a gradual alteration in gut microbial composition which can lead to microbiota-driven systemic inflammation and disruption to the body’s metabolic and immune systems (Keenan et al., 2013; Najmanovich et al., 2013). It is certainly the case that once these meningo-cerebral events occur at an advanced state in the disease process, this leads to the generation of neurotoxic metabolites that can be detected in biological samples of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood samples of patients affected (Brundel et al., 2014; Wesseling et al., 2013).
In order to truly answer whether these microbiome derived toxins can influence progression of disease, we need to rule out potential contaminants, so most recent studies have employed the use of CDI free bacteria, carried in a trans-triplicate of gDNA-free falcon tubes (sample tubes in which bacterial cells have been fully disrupted by a DNAse treatment) to accurately account for the isolation of endotoxin instead of DNA from any bacterial or archaeal species present. Indeed, our latest work in collaboration with Chelsie Campbell from the University of Edinburgh, in attempting to identify markers of disease states from whole blood samples has confirmed the presence of endotoxin from the transference of whole bacterial cells into the white blood cell preparation used in this assay (Power et al., 2014). This study successfully isolated markers of the disease states from the control group and those individuals in the late stages of Parkinson’s disease, which indicated the presence of circulating endotoxin originating from the gut microbial populations and translocated across the blood brain barrier and into the brain. This new work is suggesting endotoxins may be the beginning of the disease pathway for disease progression of neurological diseases. Furthermore, when taken together, the interrelationship between the gut microbiota, the gut-liver-brain axis may provide an opportunity to apply positive modulatory treatment to stimulate the innate immune system and kick-start neuroprotection in Parkinson’s disease patients.

In the early 1960s, meteorologists were among a group of scientists in the USA being persecuted by US Senator Joseph McCarthy and his HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee). Prof. Arnold Schierhuber, head of the Austrian Meteorological Institute, even went as far as resigning and seeking asylum in Sweden. Science established itself as a counterforce to the so-called ‘McCarthy hysteria’, much like in 2017, with the attack of Donald Trump on climate scientists like Michael Mann. As scientists have consistently proven, it is not beneficial for humanity to follow this US leader down a path of destruction. In 1962, meteorologist Robert Matthews, called scientists who favoured man-made climate change ‘propagandists’, while some German politicians wanted scientists to stop naming weather phenomena, for fear that international treaty negotiations with Germany, could be jeopardised.
In this talk, climate scientists Stuart Browning and Steve Easterbrook aim to dispel the notion that the role of scientists is to predict the weather for an ‘industry of fools’, simply to make them more fearful of hurricanes and tornadoes. They demonstrate that meteorologists’ other, more ethically-loaded, work, is to communicate more effectively to the public, to justify and inform policy-making, in order to accelerate global solutions. They seek to deliver good communications and explain complex science as they perform their research, whether they be presenting scientific results at conferences, giving public lectures, writing reports, advising policy-makers or participating in the media. Their most important responsibility is to engage in the communication of science, making the world better able to tackle the problems it faces, primarily including the climate crisis.

778,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," in the style of William Shakespeare Certainly, I shall endeavor to weave a tale of meditation in the style of Shakespeare. In the court of King Henry VIII, a young and ambitious squire named Thomas sought to learn the art of meditation. His heart was set on attaining a peaceful mind and a calm disposition, which would serve him well in his future endeavors.

He first approached the queen herself, who was renowned for her serene presence and quiet contemplation. She took him under her wing and showed him the art of sitting quietly and focusing on the breath, without any distractions. Thomas struggled at first, for his mind would often wander and he would become agitated. But with the queen's guidance, he learned to still his thoughts and let his breath guide him.

He also sought the counsel of a wise old monk, who lived in a secluded monastery in the countryside. The monk taught him the ancient art of mindfulness, which involved paying attention to the present moment and acknowledging one's thoughts without judgment. Thomas found this practice difficult at first, for he was used to suppressing his emotions and thoughts. But with time, he learned to accept his emotions and thoughts as they were, and to let them pass without becoming attached to them.

Finally, Thomas turned to the words of Shakespeare, who was a great believer in the power of meditation. He delved into the bard's works, studying the meditative themes of his plays and sonnets. He found that Shakespeare's poetry was a form of meditation in itself, a way to quiet the mind and enter into a deeper state of awareness.

And so, Thomas continued to practice the art of meditation, combining the teachings of the queen, the monk, and the bard. He found that his mind became clearer, his emotions more stable, and his thoughts more peaceful. He became known as a man of great wisdom and serenity, and was soon appointed as a councilor to the king himself.

In the end, Thomas realized that meditation was not just a means to an end, but a way of life. It taught him to live in the present moment, to appreciate the beauty of nature, and to love and be loved. And so he passed on the teachings of meditation to the next generation, ensuring that the art would endure for generations to come.

What are some common misconceptions about meditation that people may have? There are several misconceptions about meditation that people may have, including:

This chapter sets out to understand what robotics means and how it fits into the human quest for self-discovery in an increasingly advanced and complex world. From ancient mythology to the present day, robotics has been used in many cultures to represent certain features of human nature: its religious meanings are well documented, but it is also used as an expression of philosophical systems, social ideals, and cultural values. It is an instrument in society to shape and inform human experiences and perceptions of the world, and even of its own role in the world. This chapter examines robots as symbols of human nature, treating robotic representations as if they were “human in robot suits.” It begins with the earliest known references to robots in Chinese mythology and moves on to more recent research that also sets out to restore the missing explanatory context in the forms of poems and historical accounts that describe the use of robots in Japan at the height of its centuries-long cultural influence and power. It then considers robots in other cultures and gives special attention to the myths of various Asian cultures, treating the robot not as a fantasy but as a cultural resource and a social phenomenon that has played a historically influential role in shaping how people think, believe, and experience reality. The chapter finally traces how robots have become dehumanized as a product of the global modernization and technological challenges that humans have faced today.

Review Article Article

Robotics is a rapidly growing area of technology and science with strong potential for the betterment of human life (Cassidy & Lee, 2017). It is a booming research field with a global market of over $125 billion per year and is set to grow to over$230 billion by 2025 (Burgess & Zohar, 2017; Kaller, 2016). Despite these huge projections and ever-increasing investment in robotics research and development, the anthropological and sociological studies of robots remain relatively rare. Dutton (2017) found 109 studies published in 2017 alone and many more in 2018. Yet, these studies tend to be dominated by design and engineering perspectives and rarely take account of the full range of cultural meanings that robots have had. The main problem that has been identified is the lack of understanding of the “the meaning of the machine in itself and the meaning of the machine as a mediator between the natural world and human activities” (Housley & Owston, 20",476,4,2511
780,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", and gleaning insights about the nature of art from artistic endeavors, has been central to my role as a teacher and a writer for the last five years. Ever since I read ""My Sentence Was a Thousand Years of Joy"" in high school, poetry has been part of my education. I gained in my understanding of the imagination and human experience, particularly through the subjects and themes of its most prestigious authors. In the process of composing and analyzing poetry of all sorts, I also came to appreciate creativity and human expression in novel ways.
Through these lessons, I've come to believe that poetry was, and is, my main source of sustenance and my vehicle of growth. I discovered that at the personal, emotional, and artistic level, this literary form is most elemental and profound. I pursued English literature courses in college and honed my analytical and critical eye, and I received a BA from Hunter College, and an MA from Columbia's School of the Arts. Under the guidance of Grace Schulman, I participated in the Graves House Workshop, an innovative MFA program. I did a total of four years in workshops with June Joyner, Sam Hamill, and Elizabeth Alexander, three of the foremost minds and poets in the NYC community. These artists were an extraordinary influence on my creative development as an amateur writer.
I also started writing professionally in my sophomore year in high school, and have since continued to serve as a literary contributor in literary magazines, and performed in venues all over the country as a singer-songwriter for over 15 years. My poems have been recognized at the National Scholastic Writers' Awards, and I am currently working on my debut novel about girls and music, which might be the subject of my second major creative project in my adult life. In the meantime, I've had the opportunity to teach students of all ages, including at Columbia University. It is a joyous and meditative task to bring the truth and beauty of art into my students' work in order to inspire new life in their text.
About Sam: Sam Stevens holds a BA from Columbia University in history, and an MA in creative writing from Columbia's School of the Arts.

The Russian name for Sputnik is Commeleon.
It took the satellite about 98 minutes to complete a full orbit.
Sputnik 2 carried the first animal in space, a dog named Laika, but Laika died within two days of entering space due to overheating in the capsule.
The moon has dark and light areas. The dark areas are caused by dust and ice. The light areas are made up of mountains and hills, and they are brighter because they are made of volcanic rock.
The moon is tidally locked with the earth, which means that the same side of the moon always points in the same direction in relation to the sun.
The solar system consists of the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and other heavenly bodies.
There are eight planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The eight planets make up about 99.8 percent of the mass of the solar system.
Every planet in our solar system has a ring around it. The rings are usually made of ice and dust.
If you look at a planet in a telescope, you will not be able to see any stars around it because the planet is in front of the stars and they are too faint to see.
NASA space agency launched a mission to Moon called Artemis. The mission's main goal is to pave the way for human exploration of Mars.
Astronauts have gone to the moon more than 15 times and have landed on it 10 times. The last time was in December 1972.

786,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and artificial intelligence (AI) systems have led to large increases in the availability of data for use in data mining and pattern recognition algorithms. Knowledge extraction from datasets is a critical, sometimes critically hard, problem. The data are typically plentiful, but frequently noisy, incoherent, or improperly labeled. Proper knowledge extraction from data is a challenging but important task. This dissertation research attempts to automatically extract meaningful knowledge from noisy big data sets and apply the concepts to practical needs.
State-of-the-art unsupervised learning for such big data requires two issues to be addressed: First, huge amount of data and computation can be prohibitive and, second, massive amounts of datasets need to be processed in order to discover useful, but elusive, patterns. In this dissertation, we address the problem using an integrated technique: we combine and extend semisupervised pattern extraction algorithms, such as Neural Probabilistic Models (NPMs), which improve data distributions based on labeled data to deal with noise and a larger amount of datasets; and fully supervised knowledge extraction algorithms, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), which can propagate the wrong information to assist models in finding the hidden patterns, to improve the overall results.
To make DNNs better at extracting knowledge, we also propose a data distillation method, which uses synthetic data to obtain a more accurate DNN model, by introducing pseudo-labeled data. For knowledge extraction from open data, such as Web and social networks, we also propose a sampling method to extract datasets with minimal information.
For data distillation, we introduced an inductive and transductive phase. In the inductive phase, we extract high-level features, which are then used to extract a dense mapping model from unlabeled datasets. In the transductive phase, we use the dense mapping model to explore all relationships between data points, which are hidden inside unlabeled datasets. In the sampling phase, we create a long-tailed distribution based on the results from data distillation, which generates synthetic datasets with varying proportions. For finding common relationships among data, we introduce a novel hybrid learning method, which combines ideas from NPMs and the deep representation framework. The results from NPMs are combined with the DNN to create a DNN-NPM hybrid model, which is trained on multiple sub-datasets (hypervectors) and combined to learn the relationships hidden inside every sub-dataset.",523,4,2577
787,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," technology have made things more convenient for people all over the world to become healthy and fit. We can now track our activity, monitor our energy expenditure and calorie intake, or even check our body composition.
If you are used to calculating your calorie intake using a nutritionist or online calculator, or you do it by hand, know that tracking the calories in the foods you eat is more complicated than you think. If you would like to stay on track with your diet, you need to keep track of the total calories, a balance of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Not to mention, you need to understand the difference between absolute calories and relative calories. This article will explain what exactly a calorie is, why it's important, and how you can monitor your calorie intake.
A calorie is the unit of measurement of energy. When someone's activity requires the use of energy, it is measured in calories. You can measure calories by food or any other thing that requires energy to function. The basic purpose of a calorie is to measure the energy that is required to burn 1 gram of fat.
Your daily diet is your main source of energy. During the day, your body is constantly using energy and working. Since there are numerous energy sources in your diet, your calorie requirements may vary. Also, not all of your calories are usable. Some of them come from fats and proteins and those calories are used to supply energy for all of your organs. The energy that is not consumed is stored in your body in various ways.
When you are on a diet, it is important to eat a well-balanced diet, especially when it comes to calories. You can not only eat foods that are high in energy, but also foods that are low in calories. You can find your ideal calorie level by either calculating or measuring the amount of calories you are consuming on a daily basis. Knowing your ideal calorie level can help you make adjustments to your diet.
There are two types of calories: absolute and relative calories. The difference is that the absolute calorie is based on the total amount of food you consume, while the relative calorie is based on the amount of food you actually eat.
The nutritional value of the food you eat is important when it comes to maintaining your health and wellbeing. People who want to lose weight should not only pay attention to the calories in their diet, but also the nutritional value of the food they consume.

788,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", as the most science that can adopt known approaches to understand brain mechanisms, has gathered considerable momentum in the recent decades. The interdisciplinary field consists of two fields. One is the biomedical and clinical neuroscience, and the other is the cognitive and behavioral neuroscience. The former tries to understand the origin of syndromes, diseases, and behavior through neurobiological causes of the brain. The latter studies brain mechanism in the same way but focuses on understanding and interpreting complex cognitive and behavioral characteristics, including emotions, intentions, creativity, motivation, reasoning, language, and mental pictures.
To study these intriguing features of neuroscience, a range of behavioral and brain science methodologies is routinely and successfully used: behavioral tests, fine and coarse-grained electrophysiology, neuroimaging, single neuron recordings, as well as a variety of sophisticated animal models. The analysis and interpretation of these data sets is usually undertaken through a set of theoretical tools: computational neuroscience, data mining, cognitive modeling, machine learning, and, more recently, complex networks analysis (Cellai, Mazzocchi, Pizzamiglio, 2009; Kurzban, 2006).
We try to understand the fundamental mechanisms by which data are produced in the sciences of brain. To this purpose, we make an active use of tools and theories from diverse disciplinary fields such as mathematics, biology, medicine, computer science, physics, chemistry, and psychology. In this day and age, the abundant amount of research data in such interdisciplinary fields as neuroscience makes the study of the mechanisms by which data are produced an urgent task for any one.
ComPNeS is also interested in exploring what kind of approaches and methods could be efficiently applied to extract theoretical knowledge from data through an appropriate combination of quantitative methods from the above disciplines.
We welcome collaboration on any subject of interest in neuroscience and beyond.

If you’ve been considering creating your own music but are unsure of where to start, fear not. All you need is an internet connection, and some smart tactics. Here are some top tips for those of you making your musical debut.
It’s vital that you get your computer set up for sound editing and music production. Your best bet is to get yourself a powerful desktop or laptop computer and some decently expensive headphones. Recording music requires a strong computer and loud headphones to really blow your potential fans away.
You can spend thousands on state of the art, and very expensive, audio software and equipment, but at the end of the day, you don’t need all that in order to start mixing your own tracks and releasing music. In fact, the more you do it, the better you become, and the less you’ll rely on fancy programmes and expensive equipment.
Take a crash course on producing and the internet is full of content that can get you started without burning a hole in your pocket.
Pay attention to what the experts are talking about. Join a forum, or two or three. Listen to popular trends, and dive in. That’s what will get you heard. Going at it alone is not going to do it for you, so pay attention and make your mark.
Getting your music heard is as simple as taking the next step to listening to and making music. Get your ears opened up to what’s out there, your eyes on what’s possible, and trust us, you’ll be able to do it too.",318,4,1456

Once upon a time, in a small town in the heart of Europe, there was a man named Max. Max had always been fascinated by cinema, and had dreamed of opening his own movie theater. He spent years saving up, and finally, one day, he opened his own cinema.

At first, Max had only a handful of customers, but he worked tirelessly to make his cinema a success. He hired the best projectionists, and carefully selected each film that was shown. Max loved nothing more than seeing people coming to his cinema, laughing and crying together, and experiencing the magic of the movies.

Over the years, Max's cinema became a beloved institution in the town. People from all over came to watch the latest films, and Max was always there to welcome them and share in their joy. He even started a movie club, where regular customers could share their favorite films and discuss them together.

Max's cinema was not just a place to watch movies, but a place to connect with others. The people of the town came together to share their love of cinema, and Max was right there to help them do so.

As Max got older, he began to worry about what would happen to his cinema when he was gone. He didn't want to leave it in the hands of someone who wouldn't understand the importance of cinema to the town. So, he came up with a plan. He would find a young person who loved cinema as much as he did, and hand over the reins of his cinema to them.

Max spent months looking for the right person, and finally, he found him. His name was Lucas, and he was a young film student who had just moved to town. Max knew that Lucas was the right person to take over his cinema, and he passed on the keys to him, along with all of his knowledge and love of cinema.

Lucas was overjoyed when Max handed over the keys to him, and he spent the next few months renovating the cinema. He added new seating, a state-of-the-art sound system, and even started showing some of the older movies that Max had loved in his younger years.

Today, Lucas's cinema is more successful than ever. People from all over the world come to see the movies that Lucas has chosen, and they leave feeling uplifted and inspired. And every time Max looks up at his old cinema, he knows that he did the right thing in passing it on to Lucas.",505,4,2280

Working in an agency you have to come up with great ideas, campaigns, concepts. Your ideas or campaigns will get in the mind of consumers and influence them to do something. Either to buy the product or to think differently. Engineers on the other hand, like us, think of how to make things work better. They come up with something that is logically working. One uses logic to become great, the other one uses ideas.
Here are 3 elements to a great campaign. For me, these are the basics and most important.
It is bad business when the promotion you start is not aligned with what you are currently doing. There is nothing worse then looking like you are ‘inside a loop’. If something does not work there is no point to keep doing it. Stay honest about it and let the consumer know you worked out the flaw and changed it. The person behind this is smart, but for sure not all the people that are consuming.
Through all our branding, funnily enough often the important logo and name of the organisation are not on a beautiful design or concept. If you would like to influence the consumer, then it is important to let your DNA shine. All examples in the reports below show they have one clear logo, have a nice colour scheme and that are very consistent with this.
A strong brand and campaign help you identify the most important parts of it and strengthen these parts. If you’ve been at the top for a while you have to remind the customers of the unique attributes that make you tick, or you will become just another face in the crowd.
For now, we’ll focus on broadcast media. Broadcasting media costs have increased dramatically over the years. And what seems to be the most important now for advertisers is volume and less competition.

797,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," can often lead to misconceptions about psychology-related careers. Below is a list of questions frequently asked by people interested in studying psychology or in pursuing one of the related fields.
What are some misconceptions about psychology?
What kinds of jobs are available in psychology?
There are a wide variety of jobs available in psychology. The World Health Organization estimates there are more than 60,000 professional psychologists in the United States. It is believed that many of these psychologists work with the approximately 100 million people that suffer from mental, emotional, or behavioral disorders. There are also therapists who practice in a wide variety of settings, such as hospitals, senior citizen centers, schools, and corporations. Medical doctors, lawyers, and social workers regularly consult psychologists as members of an interdisciplinary team when dealing with severe emotional or behavioral problems, or as part of a team addressing issues within their practice or law.
What kinds of training are needed to become a professional psychologist?
There is no single, direct path to become a professional psychologist. The majority of psychologists need a doctoral degree from an accredited university and the requisite experience through internships and residencies. There are several doctoral-level degrees from which to choose, including the Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy), Psy.D. (Doctor of Psychology), and Ed.D. (Doctor of Education), among others. Whatever degree you choose, it is recommended that you go to a university in the top 25th percentile for psychology that has an APA-accredited doctoral program, because those schools are best prepared to provide the training and experiences that will best prepare you for a career as a psychologist.
What kinds of undergraduate majors are appropriate for psychology?
Psychology majors can find a wide variety of careers that focus on pursuing social justice, providing psychological support, and working to increase quality of life. Because psychology majors need to prepare for a rigorous graduate program, they should enroll in mathematics and statistics courses. Many students opt to take courses in philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and other social sciences.
Those students who wish to study a more applied area of psychology may want to combine their psychology major with an education in communication (including speech, language and hearing sciences), and/or social work. Others who want to study a very specific area of psychology can find specialized graduate programs. For example, those who wish to become forensic psychologists should be sure to combine their major in psychology with a minor in criminal justice, criminology, or a related field. Students who plan to become family therapists should find a school that has a dual major or minor",521,4,2848

As time is constantly moving forward, there are several forms of meditation that are directed to meet the health and nutritional needs of its practice.
Meditation is important for the body because, it helps with the control of stress in your body. It’s a natural way to reduce your stress. The aspects of a stress-relief meditation, includes mental relaxation, which helps remove the burden of stress for the body’s peace and health. There are different techniques used in meditation. The different meditation techniques include meditation that lets you focus on your breath in order to control your stress. The focus is on your breathing as you relax your body. During the meditative session, you will be thinking about how to enjoy the benefits that comes with your mind. I have personally discovered that my concentration is better when I use the attention directing meditative technique. By directing your attention to one object or a word, you begin to reduce the strain of your mind and body.
Meditation is also about teaching you how to manage and control your thoughts. Meditation needs to be practiced on a daily basis for a holistic approach to managing the body. Also, you have the option to practice for a long or short session. The end results are dependent upon the technique and frequency at which you practice. With a regular practice of meditation, the mind will be able to control your body’s response to stress and provide health benefits.

Q: Do you find it difficult to use your cultural perspective in your art?
CB: I don't necessarily find it difficult to use my cultural perspective to create art because I'm taught that the different perspectives can enrich my art. I've been taught to use my perspective to show what life is like here in Southern life and the challenges I face and how I get through them.

Scientific research is the core element of the department. The courses are about research at the interfaces between geosciences and environmental sciences.
We conduct research with a view to both basic and applied questions. Our research programme consists of three main themes: “Earth systems”, “Geo and environmental change” and “Human resource evolution”.
Within the Earth system discipline, we are researching Earth processes in the past, present, and future to deepen our understanding of geo-environmental systems and human interactions with nature.
The discipline of Geo and Environmental Change focuses on how human and nature have interacted, and how interaction has developed. This is a multi-disciplinary field that draws on historical, societal, political and technological perspectives.
In this research domain, we focus on the major changes to Earth systems in the Anthropocene era and human society over the last tens of thousands of years. We also look ahead to future scenarios for human-nature interactions. Research includes topics such as current land use (forestry, agriculture, construction), climate change, and natural hazards such as landslides, river flooding, and drought. A key research focus concerns the effects of human activities on the ‘natural’ system. We also conduct research into societal and political issues, for example, how the effects of climate change are being communicated, how the concept of ‘nature’ should be defined and how the future of natural resource management should be conceptualised.
We investigate how natural resources, such as water and minerals have been and are being exploited throughout human history. The resource age includes resource conservation issues such as waste, recycling and resource recycling, as well as issues concerning energy and climate change (energy and materials in the context of climate change and how human activities affect the carbon cycle). In line with our research theme “human resource evolution”, research focuses on “how resources are used and exploited” from past to present.

Although it is our attempt to outline the multitude of studies and streams of thought in the field of psychological anthropology from a more oriental perspective. Later we will take a closer look at the psychological roots of psychoanalysis, among other things. Ethnographic studies can be traced back to ethnographic disciplines in the 19th century (see Figure 2). Then came psychoanalytic studies which introduced the unconscious and transitional conditions and involved a connection between the conscious and unconscious mind. Jung's analytical psychology extended into and through the overlapping psychologies that surrounded postwar Sweden. As we continue to analyze our data, we'll continue our analysis of the culture wars to hear what the people had to say when we asked them to participate in a brief survey. / We discussed an interesting topic about the relationship between culture and psychology and hope to expand the topic in further study. Western, Islamic, and Chinese psychology are the three branches of the study of psychology, and Chinese psychology has played a historical role in shaping the mental health of Chinese people. Our survey asks participants to answer some questions about their culture, psychology, and attitudes, and then offers a choice of cultural group and personality traits.

# Back cover

This book is about making the reader to be able to explain why science is possible at all (in the book it is described as being in a position to be able to debunk mythological claims, including ones that are found in modern times, such as “the hard problem of consciousness”). The key elements are:

• Scientific method. A great chapter here on this topic, I always wanted to read a thorough treatment about the methodology of science.
• Natural philosophy: Here you will find a justification for science. Science seeks to understand the workings of nature, we know that it is possible to do so given that nature has been studied intensively for centuries and yet even now our understanding of it keeps getting better.

Science can continue to do so since it claims that God is not involved in our universe. What drives science is the basic assumption of physicalism: if something can be created or eliminated, it is a physical entity. Furthermore, whatever is not physical, is not real, and cannot be studied.
That is, we distinguish what can be touched, it is physical. If it cannot, it is not physical, and therefore we cannot study it, including claims about “not-me” (which we touched earlier). This is a new logical argument that I have not seen before (the original one is presented by Arthur Danto). If one can measure something, then it is physical, and if one cannot measure it, then it is not physical.

Machine learning algorithms and their applications in various industries have become an integral part of our lives in the modern world. In this post, we will discuss the cultural significance of machine learning.

Machine learning has revolutionized the way we approach problems and has provided new tools for individuals and societies to solve complex problems. It has had a significant impact on society, politics, economics, and culture. Below are some of the cultural significance of machine learning:

1. Social Impact:

Machine learning has a significant impact on society and has the potential to shape social change. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to identify and address social issues such as poverty, crime, and inequality. It has the ability to identify patterns in large datasets and can help policymakers make informed decisions to address these issues.

2. Entertainment:

Machine learning has also impacted the entertainment industry. It has become an essential tool in creating personalized content for audiences. Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify use machine learning algorithms to recommend movies and music to users based on their preferences.

3. Politics:

Machine learning algorithms have also been used to influence political outcomes. For example, deepfakes, which are deep-learning-based manipulations of images and videos, have been used to create fake news and influence public opinion. It can also be used to detect fake news and misinformation on social media.

4. Business:

Machine learning has revolutionized the way businesses operate. Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning algorithms to personalize their services and improve their customer experience. It has also helped to improve customer satisfaction and increase revenue for businesses.

In conclusion, machine learning has had a profound cultural impact on society. It has influenced the way we approach problems, entertainment, politics, and business. It has the potential to shape our future and create a more informed and connected world.

How do machine learning algorithms work?

Machine learning algorithms are a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enable machines to learn and improve without being explicitly programmed. They work by analyzing data and identifying patterns that can be used to make predictions or decisions. Here's a general overview of how they work:

1. Data Collection:

The first step in machine learning is data collection. This involves gathering relevant data from various sources, such as databases, documents, or sensors. The data must be labeled, which means that each data point is assigned a label or category.

2. Data Preprocessing:

Once the data is collected, it must be preprocessed to ensure that it is clean, accurate, and in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. This involves tasks such as",527,4,2897

Whew, ML practicals are finally done for the semester, but as always I felt a bit more of my machine learning background refreshed during the last week. Machine learning seems to be making a splash at 1U this semester and I'm thrilled to see more and more co-requisites popping up in my classes.

A lot of the skills that undergraduates use in academia (that may or may not translate in industry) are not going to be the ones employers will want to see for graduate jobs and it looks like machine learning will definitely be a major skill by 2020, right alongside working with data (see Cathy O'Neil's Weapons of Math Destruction). This is definitely a career move for me that I'm planning for and while it's still a bit too early to dig into it, I figured a neat little guide was in order. I'll probably keep this updated to help whenever I'm in the market and you can also find it on GitHub

What is machine learning?

For a high level overview of machine learning (and what I didn't necessarily learn about when I took AI), I've found how hard it is to get an apt definition of what it is but I found this short guide to be quite helpful:

So basically, machine learning is just a way to measure uncertainty using statistics. We use this method in everything:

ML helps us answer questions that will follow any data we put in. As the famous saying goes: if you can't measure it, you can't optimize it. It is this statistical nature that allows us to make predictions, which in turn allows us to improve the world around us (e.g. self-driving cars).

As the name suggests, machine learning is a computer based model that allows the computer to adapt to the world with data. And that's the magic part. But behind this simple name, machine learning is truly an interdisciplinary field that merges statistics, algebra, and programming.

You see the acronym ML everywhere, but is it worth your time?

It is almost necessary if you want to succeed in tech and the number of jobs is increasing! This is the analysis from Stack Overflow:

Though you don't have to major in machine learning, it is not a bad idea to take courses with a subset of ML. If you are looking for another class to take, Google recommends this one (take both of these and you are a machine learning master).

Our study of waves in the course of oceanography is a part of dynamics, which includes sub-disciplines such as fluid dynamics, meteorology, and geophysics. Dynamicists look into the physical processes, such as winds and forces exerted by water, which are the driving forces behind water movement and sediment movement. Waves are an integral part of that physical science and they may be modelled in combination with heat and moisture transfer as fluids move around. Ocean waves may be modelled and analysed to predict currents and water movement that may occur if the weather should change.
The phenomena that occur on the surface of water are especially complex, involving physical, chemical, and biological phenomena as well as changes due to time (cyclical). The science of oceanography includes research into such features of ocean waves as their stability, the relationship between wave frequency and wind speed, and the directional swell that results from wind.
It is possible to study the movement of waves, winds, currents, and sedimentation separately, or to attempt to integrate their motion. Forecasts are made to allow people to safely venture out to sea, and to manage the effects of waves on infrastructure. The shape of seashores, lighthouses, and harbours depend on the variety of ocean waves.
Modern oceanography includes understanding of waves from the surface down to the continental shelf. The research is carried out in laboratories as well as in natural settings. It encompasses observations and measurements of water samples, water column studies, laboratory models of ocean behaviour, and modern instruments.",357,4,1890

If you discover a problem with your phone battery charging overnight, simply connect it to the charger during the day. The phone needs to get ample charge in order to power on. If you leave it on the charger all night long, it could wear out the charger or damage the phone.
Be very careful with extended warranties. Often, these are not worth the paper they are printed on. If you get a broken phone, phone service for the initial year is typically covered by the basic warranty. You can extend your warranty protection for more money.
If you do have a touchscreen phone, make sure to use a screen protector. These may make using the phone more challenging. Even though they are simple to use and clean, any dirt or scuffs left on them could make the screen harder to see. You may also want one because they will help to prevent damage if you drop it.
Your phone’s camera doesn’t have an optical zoom. If you want to get a true zoom, you must move closer. There are also a few lenses that you can purchase that allow you to get a true zoom.
In order to save power, turn off any wireless features you’re not using, such as Bluetooth and GPS. Your battery is not gonna last if you allow your phone to stay on all the time.
Don’t rush in purchasing the newest and greatest phone. It’s often the case that the newest mobile devices have only minor adjustments and updates. Reading reviews can help you determine whether a newer model is worth the price tag or not.
Consider doing an upgrade for a new cell phone when your battery dies. The cell phone and its battery are on a continual cycle of charging. The battery in your phone will eventually wear out. If you can, keep an extra battery with you for that extra charge.
Use your phone phone and so forth. Do a good bit of research on the most popular apps to find out which types you really use. You should probably have apps that allow you to track fitness, including time and distance. This will let you track your diet.
Why pay for the newest phone when your contract is still running? Some providers offer great upgrades. Therefore, it is a great idea to buy an old model to save some money.
After reading the above article you can see how important knowing more about your cell phone can be. These tips will assist you in getting started with your",526,4,2476

Sure, I'd be happy to help explain the concept of architecture in software development.

Architecture is the overall design of a software system. It defines how the different components of the system will interact with each other and how they will be organized to accomplish the system's goals. The architecture is the foundation of a software system, and it sets the stage for the development process.

In software development, architecture refers to the high-level design of the system, including the overall structure, the interactions between the different components, and the principles and rules that govern the development process. It includes the software's structure, interfaces, dataflows, hardware and network components, and other elements that affect the system's operation.

The architecture of a software system is typically created early in the development process and is refined as development progresses. It is an essential step in the software development process because it sets the stage for the system's implementation and helps ensure that the system is scalable, maintainable, and flexible.

When creating an architecture, it is important to consider factors such as performance, scalability, reliability, and security. The architecture should also take into account the system's intended users and the environment in which the system will operate.

Overall, architecture is an essential part of software development. It sets the stage for the development process and helps ensure that the final system is scalable, maintainable, and flexible.",289,4,1594

Our chemistry curriculum offers students a broad and flexible foundation, from organic chemistry to analytical techniques and physical science. Students choose between two areas of emphasis: Analytical Chemistry and Chemistry and Biochemistry.
Chemistry is the study of the composition and structure of matter. It is one of the basic sciences, and all sciences, from biology and environmental science to physics and nanoscience, can be traced to chemical processes. Chemistry, therefore, is not only of intrinsic scientific interest, but is a course of study with applications in the world around us. Students will learn the essential concepts of organic and inorganic chemistry and will be exposed to the various methods used to investigate chemical phenomena. A second-year course in inorganic chemistry further builds on knowledge of molecular structure, chemical bonding, and the roles of electron configurations and configurations of radiation emitted by atoms during chemical reactions. The accompanying computer laboratory (Chromatography and Spectroscopy Lab) gives students the opportunity to develop the skills required to operate these instruments.
Our three faculty members bring a broad array of research interests to our chemistry program, resulting in a wide variety of courses and program options for undergraduate students. All three faculty work closely with members of the Department of Biochemistry and also with other faculty across the Faculty of Science. Three examples of their research interests follow: catalysis for chemical synthesis, nanomaterials and magnetism. Find out more about their research here.
Molecular Spectroscopy Lab provides students with hands-on experience in light spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopy, with applications in biophysical chemistry and organic synthesis. The second-year Practical Organic Chemistry laboratory is the starting point for a program in the modern organic chemistry laboratory. It provides the fundamentals in chromatography and spectroscopy, with applications to quantitative analysis, synthesis, reaction mechanisms, qualitative analysis, and the preparation and analysis of various samples. The laboratory sets up students for upper-level organic chemistry laboratory courses.",413,4,2438

For example, computer-assisted techniques have transformed scientific illustration, including three-dimensional graphics. Surveys of art and literature in literature science show that, although art and science hardly ever meet before the twentieth century, since that time they have had a number of important encounters.
Since the time of antiquity, individuals have applied scientific discoveries and principles in the domains of art and literature. At the very least, inventive thinking combined with this type of knowledge provides the basis of the arts. To succeed in the literary tradition, writers and artists have had to refine their approach to success.
If you choose the sciences and your understanding of how the world functions along with logic will assist you when you develop ideas for literature and art. In addition, your visual and tangible approach to problem solving will give you the skills required to employ computer-enhanced techniques in visual art. In some circumstances, you may need to convey ideas clearly in writing.
Whether you are a fiction writer or an artist, you have to do more than tell a great tale or create gorgeous, meticulously detailed works of art. On the surface, every component of the arts is outlined by rules that are strictly dictated by tradition and standards of the field. If you follow these principles, you will develop a success story as an artist or a writer in the realm of creativity.
When you view the world as individuals, and you continue to do so, your understandings of natural phenomena will always be enhanced. They will have a more profound effect on your artistic creations than your awareness of a particular science or the ability to perform complex functions. Nonetheless, you must be able to combine all of your knowledge, experience, and research in the organization of your work so that people will be able to understand your story and, more significantly, your message or motivation.
On the other side, you must be educated in the scientific method in order to execute your work with precision. The results will be more successful because you will be able to find new ways to adapt and expand your ideas. Whether you're discussing music, movie, writing, television, graphic design, or computer engineering, creativity continues to evolve with our science. Today's new musical instruments are already equipped with more advanced technologies.
Throughout our lives, our memories are a combination of science and art. Perhaps because our thoughts are intertwined, it is impossible to examine human character or experience without our emotions.

His focus on developing his meditation techniques came from many years of personal observations, experimentation and great reward from his devotees. He was so enamoured of meditation that he gave up his very loving wife, who later became his devotee.
He developed the technique of meditation from two branches. One was seeking the elimination of the delusion in man, by using the ""science of sensation"". This second branch of practice he coined ""mantra-samhara"" or ""mantra practice"".
The mantra was taught as a technique to focus his mind's attention on the Omkrishna mantra to bring about the change in his mind that he desired. Thereby, he would attain greater awareness of himself.
There are different types of mantras and the yogi would use different ones depending on his thoughts or beliefs. He would also change his mantra as his thoughts and feelings changed.
His mantra practice and techniques are very similar to what many modern scientists have come up with. The main idea is that our mind is like a machine and its actions are like the operations of the machine. If we want to change the way our mind thinks, we need to learn how to change the program that drives our mind. We must learn to change the thoughts.
There is no difference between a mantra and a mantra practice. A mantra practice is the practice of focusing our attention on an object of meditation, not necessarily on the mantra itself.
Our focus is focused on an object and the mental representation of the object. If you think about a flower, you have to focus your attention on it before it can actually become a part of you.
The very act of visualizing an object in your mind's eye and training yourself to notice and be aware of the movement and changes in the mental imagery itself is called the ""meditation.""
The same goes for a mantra. If we visualize a mantra and focus on it until it becomes part of our subconscious mind, we can use it to change our beliefs or attitudes. By doing this, we can find better ways to control our own actions and emotions.
In order to meditate on a mantra, one must understand that they cannot be ""enlightened"" just by memorizing the mantra. However, we are very capable of becoming enlightened by simply visualizing our mantra and focusing on it",515,4,2501

## Data

We use BBT data from OpenBabel (https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/blob/master/bbt.data) for our experiments.

## Training

### Layer wise training

This approach involves assigning one task to each layer of a neural network.

The input is a matrix of the input molecules and each column represents a fingerprint. If the matrix has $N$ columns and $D$ is the desired dimension of the feature space, $X$ is an $N \times D$ matrix. The dense layers are initialized to learn the individual feature representations of each fingerprint and the connections between the input and the dense layers are not learned.

### Alignment based layer wise training

This method has the same idea as the previous one. However, it also allows us to learn the connections between dense layers.

For instance, while we only perceive a one-dimensional string attached to a two-dimensional drum as vibrating, according to a recent study, the vibrating object in fact appears to bend and vibrate out of it’s own geometry as well, which suggests that the otherwise two-dimensional drum space could eventually be perceived as two-dimensional in its own dimensions. 

Question: The geometry of quantum mechanics

Quantum geometry is the geometry of quantum mechanics, involving the use of the geometry in which quantum physics describes the internal structure and interactions of all physical objects[2]. The science behind quantum mechanics has allowed us to get a detailed understanding of how our universe works[1]. In quantum geometry, we know which quanta to expect, and when and where they should be found[3]. The wavelike nature of quantum objects means that their positions are spread out over an interval called their momentum[3]. The relationship between geometry and quantum mechanics is also summarized in the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rules[5].",222,4,1133

Astronomers have several practical interests like improving positional navigation, which helped us understand the geography, longitude, and time. They were the first to discover the magnetic property of iron and how to accurately produce magnetic compasses. Astronomers were also the first to construct accurate maps of stars on the ground. The scientific discoveries made by astronomy was among the principle causes for exploration, travel and transportation, specifically ships. Most measurements of distance, size, shape and volume used everyday on land are either based on or derived from astronomical principles, and the earth itself is also an astronomical body. Astronomers have also performed complete (albeit incomplete) assessments of the history and development of the earth and solar system. The information obtained by the science of astronomy has formed the foundation for the science of geology.
Astronomy has influenced human interaction with weather. The atmospheric pressure, the types of winds, and the temperature variations in various parts of the world were described and explained by means of astronomy. Astronomy also influenced the storm warning system, allowing ship captains and residents to predict and prepare for extreme weather and storm events. Today, we understand the mechanism of winds, tornadoes, hurricanes, hurricanes, and typhoons that are related to astronomic changes.
The timing of all events on earth has been determined by the ancient astronomers. The phases of the moon for planting, the number of days in a week, and all such things as were taken as a form of currency, an economic unit of measurement of a mile a day, an hour, and several other time intervals are determined by astronomical observations. All of these celestial events are easily explained by astronomy and are still being utilized and studied by astronomers. We have tremendous intelligence in astronomy, not only because we use it to travel in space, but also in countless daily aspects of our lives. These are only a few of the many ways that science of astronomy has altered our lives and how we view the world.",421,4,2337

But of course I needed to experiment for myself. And I needed to read up on books as well. Somehow I never got around to doing that during my first two years in university. I didn't even know what the ingredients of some of my favorite treats were, like rosewater, saffron, lavender, allspice and vanilla. However, I did learn how to make a decent chocolate cake.
Thanks to all the cooking shows I watch on TV and a few cookbooks, my recipe repertoire grew. After my second year, I did start reading up on the basics of French cooking. First, cookbooks about Thai food made their way to my shelf, then more culinary travelogues and cookbooks, then even more exotic food.
And, I'm also the person who in January 2007 bought The Food in Jars Cookbook. Her book quickly became an essential addition to my library, especially after I started my own canning adventures.
The Food in Jars Cookbook by Marisa McClellan changed everything. What a book! Apart from being gorgeous to look at, Marisa's book is as beautifully written as the perfect cookbook should be. The recipes are inspiring and doable. She has some great ideas for canning gifts, for jams, and other preserves. The big plus is that she knows exactly what foods are in season and where you can find them!
After having read her book, I was eager to know more about Marisa. This American, who moved to Philadelphia to attend university, had been a writer of cookbooks and culinary blogs for years, but always dreamed of having her own food brand. It was the time when all the Mums' cookbooks were hitting the market and the trend of canning food had just started.
After finally quitting her job as a web developer, she published the book and started Marisa McClellan Photography. Today, she offers workshops and travels around the US, spreading her message and trying to convince as many people as possible to support local markets and get in touch with their local produce. She is a true inspiration and her story gives hope to every non-English speaker wanting to get some foodie credentials, like me!

In fact, on average deep-ocean water is about the same in oxygen content as surface water. The deep-ocean is less oxygenated than surface waters where photosynthesis rates are highest – so deep-ocean oxygen levels go down during El Niño. • The ocean has a higher average salinity than the atmosphere, on average. In fact the global average salinity is almost the same in both. The distinction is because the atmospheric pressure is about 15% higher than surface pressures. If the pressure difference was the same as the salinity difference the oceans would have higher salinity. • Oceanic heat capacity is higher than that of the atmosphere. In fact the atmosphere's specific heat capacity is 6 times higher. • The 'thermostat' role of the oceans is to sustain a stable world climate in the face of a changing greenhouse gas composition. These warmer surface waters reduce upwelling, the rate at which cold, oxygenated deep water comes up to replenish the surface, and thereby warm the climate and increase CO2 in the atmosphere. • Oceanic bottom waters have a uniform temperature, and that coldness leads to global circulations and exchanges. In fact, bottom waters are not temperature uniform, have no long-range overturning, and a mean depth of up to 500m of their descent is always warmed by a variety of processes (e.g., temperature stratification, cold meltwaters, rivers, wind-driven upwelling). • The main role of the oceans is to sequester dissolved atmospheric CO2 – its burial in sediments and oxides on the ocean floor. This is a small fraction – around 35 gigatonnes per year (1 gigatonne = 1 billion tonnes). • The ocean operates in a classical and stable water cycle. Actually, about 120 x 1012 m3 of water is exchanged annually. Even if this was 'just' about a ""change"" in the water cycle (which does not seem a fair description), this annual change over the oceans is about 40 x 1012 m3, a huge flux. • The ocean operates like a gigantic refrigerator on the planet, with a global average heat capacity larger than the atmosphere, resulting in the cooling of the climate and the reduction in CO2 concentrations.

One significant area where space exploration has made a substantial impact is in the development of new technologies. With each mission, we learn something new about the world around us and create the foundation for innovative solutions to modern problems. For example, the development of technology like GPS, which relies on advanced navigation systems, has significantly improved our daily lives. Likewise, the creation of solar cells used in powering space-based missions has also led to improvements in technologies used on Earth.

Moreover, space exploration has helped us gain invaluable scientific knowledge, providing a better understanding of our planet, the solar system, and the universe at large. Through observations, measurements, and data collection, scientists can conduct experiments and make predictions that have major implications for society. Space-based missions like the Hubble Space Telescope have provided insights into the formation of stars and galaxies, unveiling the cosmic mysteries and contributing to our understanding of fundamental physics.

In addition to scientific breakthroughs, space exploration has inspired and encouraged people worldwide. The pursuit of knowledge and discovery in space has captured the imagination of millions of people, pushing us to explore beyond our planet and encouraging us to think about the possibilities of human exploration and colonization of other worlds. Such dreams help fuel innovation, encourage curiosity, and drive us to achieve great things.

Furthermore, space exploration has played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of our own planet. Through remote sensing and analysis, scientists have gained invaluable insights into our planet's natural processes, climate patterns, and geological features. This knowledge is essential for managing natural resources, mitigating environmental challenges, and understanding the effects of climate change.

As we continue to explore space, we also contribute to the development of our economy and workforce. The space industry generates significant revenue through the production of goods and services for space missions and their support infrastructure. Additionally, the technological advancements spurred by space exploration have led to spin-off innovations, with new technologies trickling down into everyday use, driving productivity and economic growth.

Another crucial aspect of space exploration is its potential for international collaboration. Space missions often involve cooperation between multiple countries and agencies, fostering a spirit of unity and goodwill. By working together to achieve common goals, we can promote peaceful relations and strengthen ties among nations, contributing to global stability and security.

Finally, space exploration has ethical implications that cannot be ignored. As we venture deeper into space",528,4,3133

Genetics is the scientific study of genes, heredity, and variation in living organisms. Genetics has a long and fascinating history that dates back to ancient times. In the early 19th century, Gregor Mendel, a monk and biologist, conducted experiments on pea plants and discovered the fundamental principles of genetics, including the fact that genes determine traits. He showed that traits are inherited in discrete units, and that the passing of traits from parents to offspring is a random process.

In the early 20th century, scientists began to study the structure of genes and how they function. Wilhelm Johannsen coined the term ""gene"" in 1909, and Thomas Hunt Morgan demonstrated in 1910 that traits are carried by chromosomes in egg and sperm cells. By the mid-20th century, geneticists had identified the genes responsible for a wide range of disorders and diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia.

Advancements in genetics have been fundamental to the development of modern medicine. One of the most significant medical breakthroughs of the 20th century was the discovery of DNA's double helix structure, which led to the development of new technologies like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, and gene editing.

PCR, which allows for the amplification of a specific DNA sequence, has enabled researchers to diagnose and detect diseases at an earlier stage. It has also made gene sequencing and analysis more affordable, allowing scientists to study the function of genes in more detail. DNA sequencing has also allowed for the identification of genetic mutations that cause diseases such as cancer, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis.

Gene editing tools like CRISPR have also revolutionized medicine, allowing scientists to edit the DNA of living cells with precision. This technology has the potential to treat genetic disorders by correcting or replacing the faulty genes that cause them.

In conclusion, genetics has made enormous contributions to medical science, and its advancements have led to groundbreaking discoveries in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. As we continue to understand the genetic makeup of living organisms, we can expect even more exciting developments in medicine in the years to come.

This is really interesting information! Can you tell me more about the potential risks of gene editing and how they are being addressed?
Certainly! While gene editing has the potential to revolutionize medicine, there are also some potential risks associated with this technology.

Is there any theme that connects the posts I wrote in October, 2020?
There is.
In this post, I reviewed the quantum variance, and how it ""creates"" quantum entanglement. In another post, I coined the term ""variational entanglement"", and showed how this concept is central to the understanding of the quantum statistical mechanics of $N$ identical (or classically correlated) particles. But my most popular post was called ""Learning with information: What is a classical state"" and linked to experimental results that I described.
What is this ""correlation function"" in the beginning of your latest post?
Good question.
In this article, I challenged the orthodoxy of classical correlations and argued that they are ""classical"", because it is derived from a naive interpretation of the classical statistical mechanics of the $N$ identical or classically correlated particles. This one can think of this as $K=N$ case where the entire multiplicity is described by classical (statistical) probabilities, and the correlation function being the typical correlation function of classical random variables, $x_1t=tx_1$.
Is that correlation $x_1t$ of your post about identical and correlated random variables?
No.
Here, I found and proved that $p(x_1t)=e^{-\beta \omega |x_1| }$ instead of $p(x_1t)=e^{-\beta \omega |x_1|}$ (I misspoke in my comments before). Now, if we check whether $p(x_1t)=e^{-\beta \omega |x_1| }$ represents a statistical mixture of identical correlated random variables, we find that the answer is negative. What makes $p(x_1t)$ to be a ""different"" type of mixture than a classical mixture is the sign of $\beta$, the inverse temperature. This ""non-trivial""",529,4,2207

Monitoring text messages remotely can become an effective aid in developing kids and saving corporate employees. Employers, for example, can follow the instructions of their workers who are busy with their mobile phones in their workplace, which harms them and their employers. In contrast, tracking text messages remotely in children's cell phones can be a perfect way for them to prevent messages from unknown individuals and provide professional guidance and advice if necessary.
3. This can often determine trust relationships
Monitoring text messages remotely is a quick and handy way for couples to verify their trust. For example, if you suspect your partner of being unfaithful to you, you can track their messages to see if they talk about it with someone else or ask whether they love you. In short, with a monitoring tool like Tactic Networks Tracer, trust is established between you and your partner so that there is no room for doubts.

833,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,": genes encoding enzymes catalyzing the conversion of soil minerals and non-essential nutrients into plant growth-stimulating organic matter, also known as humic acids, are critical to plants. However, limited access to humic soil acid has prevented wide-spread application of this organic matter to boost plant growth and suppress pests. This is because a natural humic soil acid consists of acids bound to organic matter in a soil and therefore is associated with a complex matrix structure. 1 The breakdown of a natural humic substance to free acids, solvents, and humic polymer salt weakens the soil matrix and results in an unstable and mobile acid. 2 and as such cannot be applied on field crops. As a result, various materials can be added to soils to create humic-like materials that mimic the beneficial characteristics of natural humic acid and at the same time facilitate broad-spectrum plant protection in the field.
Biological Mechanism of action for New Humic Acid–based Materials
The primary mode of action for new humic acid-based materials is predicated on the rapid biological activity observed under controlled conditions. Specifically, one humic acid–based material has been shown to stimulate turfgrass growth and suppress foliar-disease infections in turfgrass as a result of accelerated surface-site formation in soil, solubilization of plant nutrients, and enhanced microbial activity. 3 Concurrently, the other has stimulated growth and suppress disease of cucumber, watermelon, squash, and sweet pepper. This has been attributed to improved moisture retention, pathogen suppression, translocation of nutrients, soil bacteria populations, and plant responses to nutrient stimulation.4
These behaviors on the soil and plants have been ascribed to the effect of a chemical referred to as activated humic anion, which has been observed to increase nutrient availability and enhance microbial activity.5-7
The effect of these materials is not monolithic. Humic Acid-based materials, along with their unique mechanisms of action, can create dual properties that are more beneficial than a single, targeted effect.
Humic Acid-based Materials enable more sustainable agriculture by reducing fertilizer requirements, allowing for crop overproduction, and assisting in the removal of toxic chemicals. Also, those materials promote re-vegetation and recovery of mined land in environmental remediation.

However, artwork is not nothing, not a mere clarity. The knowledge of this reflection within what is not the art piece is part of the interaction.
The same is true in the case of the scene. Scene is something that not a single ""entity"" has in and of itself, but rather it is that which characterizes it as such. Therefore, in the case of the artwork and the scene, it is the ""what it is"" and ""how it is"" that must be paid attention to.
If I were to ask myself what is something and how it is, I would have to go to the materials used and the composition. In the case of the artwork, it is the materials and the composition that make the artwork a work of art.
However, there is a question of how art exists. The material is not what determines the artwork. It may be precisely the non-identification of the materials, the separation of the two, to the degree that the artwork is not contained in them. Therefore, in the case of the artwork, we should pay attention to the relationship of the entire work and the material; that is, to the way of its existence.

Schools would be no better, unless sociologists can somehow persuade those in charge of matters educational to consider society in general and the child in particular. Governments would continue to make a good attempt at ignoring the needs and wants of their peoples, so long as such matters did not create problems of actual or potential rebellion. The Church might continue to preach love of neighbour as an ideal, while itself continuing to divide people into the elect and the rest. Hospitals might go on being largely and expensively equipped scientific institutions with a veneer of humanization covering a core of mechanistic materialism. There might be no social work, or it might be carried out by people who, having no sense of an integrated society, have a only a碎片化的分立的view of man in society.
Sociologists can offer much to each of these institutions. They can help the schools to reach the maximum potential of the young through understanding the process of education. They can help the governments to decide what to educate for, how to train those who are to govern, and who are to be excluded from power on account of mental or emotional inadequacies. They can encourage the Church to consider what it can offer to society in a world of relative religious peace, and how it can influence social order for the better without forcing its own designs on unwilling parishioners. And they can contribute to the development of a science of social work.

They also study the evolution of the Earth's crust over time, including the formation of mountains, valleys, and other features.

Overall, geology is a complex and interdisciplinary field that draws on many different disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics. Geologists work in a variety of settings, including the field, the lab, and the classroom, and their work has important implications for a wide range of fields, from mining and energy extraction to environmental conservation and climate research.",291,4,1505

Harvard researchers found that patients with high blood pressure had their blood pressure readings significantly improved after participating in a study on meditation practices. Participants also showed reduced stress and improved state of mind.
Meditation is, when used properly, a very valuable tool for stress relief. It aids with relaxation, calms a mind that is noisy and helps individuals cope with stresses of everyday life. In addition, meditation is a natural pain killer that can help release tension, anxiety, worry and stress that's binding to your mind and your body. The practice has also been shown to improve brain function and increase focus and concentration.
A five minute session can help calm your thoughts, reduce stress and improve focus. Mindfulness meditation can be done anywhere by anyone: You just need to turn off distractions and find a quiet space. If it is outside you might want to watch a natural scene: the sea and a small boat; a lake; a forest and a path. If you are at home, you may want to choose a space in a room that you will make your 'quiet space' to escape to when you want a break or when you get up in the morning, such as your bedroom or a room where you can sit comfortably and comfortably, especially if you need some time to yourself or if you want to relax and refocus.
Meditation can be done in many ways, including in one-to-one sessions, with a group or in meditation classes. Whether you are trying to cope with a difficult situation or just to find some time to relax, you might want to make an appointment with a professional who can help you work through your thoughts and emotions and give you tips for coping with stress. This is a free and confidential service and there are many different types of meditation classes available, such as your local yoga class or gym.
You might also try a meditation retreat. This is usually done in a more secluded environment, away from everyday stresses and is usually quite lengthy, usually lasting from four to twelve weeks. You will be taught how to relax, take control of your thoughts and emotions and also learn how to use your body's own muscle relaxers to help you relax. You will also be shown how to concentrate on your breath to help you to relax and breathe more easily. In some cases you will be taught how to meditate during a session in order to achieve your goal.

It is a creative process that has shaped society, culture, the economy and lifestyle in countless ways since the ancient beginnings of human civilization. Engineering is the basic tool that mankind uses to change the world. The development of new technology has made way for buildings and houses, cars and other objects we take for granted today. It is the combined result of engineering and scientific knowledge, that has helped us to enjoy the fundamental benefits and comforts of modern society, making life easier and more productive.
Engineering, particularly mechanical engineering, has been one of the most important fields of development since the earliest history of mankind. Mechanical engineering is the creation and engineering of complex structures such as bridges, tunnels, dams and other structures. Mechanical engineering is an emerging field of science that has grown rapidly in the last century, due to the increased understanding of the behaviour of mechanical structures in relation to the environment and the development of new materials. This field of study is focused on the design, manufacture and installation of complex structures that satisfy certain conditions.
In most engineering programs, mechanical engineering involves the study of mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as the behaviour of mechanical systems, and the use of different forms of mathematical analysis in order to predict, analyse and optimise the behaviour of structures. Mechanical engineers use these mathematical techniques in the design and manufacture of different kinds of structures. These structures include buildings and houses, dams, bridges, and airships, as well as other complex systems such as power generation systems and wind turbines. Some of the activities that mechanical engineers do in their profession include working on power plants, refining and transportation systems, welding and heat transfer, designing hydraulic and pneumatic systems and designing and installing air conditioning and heating systems.
While mechanical engineers have played a major role in the development of industrial technology, their impact on society has been equally significant. The introduction of mechanical engineers in the early 1800s led to the development of many different types of machinery and tools, which are used in the construction of roads, canals, bridges and other structures. Mechanical engineers also played a major role in the invention of steam engines, which played a key role in the early development of the railway system. Although these technologies helped speed up the transportation of goods and people, they also led to the pollution of the environment and to the destruction of forests and other natural resources. In addition to causing the pollution of the environment, mechanical engineering also caused a lot of noise and pollution, which made it difficult for people to hear each other.

845,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," ""If you want to get the maximum amount of happiness from going to the gym, you have to get the maximum amount of effort out of your body,"" writes mental health coach Scott Adamson. ""If you can't come close to your maximum, you shouldn't be there."" That sounds easy enough in theory, but it's pretty tough to do on a consistent basis. So, how can we tell if we're getting the most out of a workout? What signals are we looking for, and how do we make sure that we're getting those signals?
To help us with that question, we need to look at what happens in our bodies when we exercise. And one very important signal is our heart rate. Normally, our heart rate will increase while we exercise. If we exercise for a long period of time, our heart rate increases. What happens when we go too long without exercising? Well, it decreases, then it starts going up again when we start exercising. It's a whole cycle.
The problem is that we don't always feel that way when we start exercising. Our body responds to all kinds of things. We all have different habits and they have different responses. For example, a type of exercise that feels hard is harder to feel than one that feels lighter. If our heart rate drops more quickly than it is going up, we will feel tired and may want to quit.
We also need to keep in mind that we are humans, not machines. Our heart rate increases and decreases, but not always at the same rate. Sometimes it goes faster, sometimes it goes slower, but in general, it is a lot lower than what we feel like it should be. If our heart rate is too low, we are usually not pushing ourselves as hard as we could be. The good news is that there is a way to train our body to increase its response to exercise.
We need to remember that when we exercise, our heart rate is a major signal. It gives us feedback about how hard we are working. When our heart rate goes up, we are increasing our strength. That's because the heart beats faster, which means that our muscles are being pushed harder, and our body needs more oxygen to keep up with the increased demand.
It's important to understand that not all types of exercise are equal. Some types of exercise don't increase our strength very much at all. If we keep doing them, we won't see any improvements. And if we do a lot of high intensity exercise, our body will get tired, and we",525,4,2352

Fashion was essentially the preserve of the rich and the aristocracy for centuries until the mid-nineteenth century. People in earlier times dressed in clothing designed to protect the body from the harsh elements of the weather and the unspeakable filth caused by the then unsanitary conditions. The image above is from the late 19th century.
Back then it was the height of fashion to make outrageous statements in clothes. When the English poet Charles Lamb went to a performance of the Shakespearean play Macbeth , he was appalled at the realisation of the barbarism and evil of the Macbeths and the witches. Lamb’s love of Shakespearean characters had led him to indulge in some high fashion clothing in the forms of a yellow and red costume which he wore that night. His reaction was profound and he went on to publish an entire series of satires attacking both the physical and spiritual state of the society he lived in.
The following passage from one of Lamb’s essays is an example of the fantastic flights of fashion which were considered high fashion at the time.
By the end of the nineteenth century and up until the first world war women had largely taken over the role of fashion. This was partly because of the necessity of women taking up the slack created by the involvement of men in the war.
However the pattern of fashion involved in clothing women was then often completely reversed by the changes associated with the second world war. This was to mark the beginning of an incredible explosion of high fashion.
The fashion industry then experienced an uncharacteristic injection of luxury as society was overcharged by the results of the world wars. The post war period was an astounding period for fashion, with manufacturers investing heavily in their products, which in turn required more information and care from the buyer. The finishing of clothes was exceptionally important, with the use of thread count being the only method of measurement of the quality of the cloth. This then spurred on the promotion and use of expensive and beautiful fabrics and dyes for the higher price markets. During the interwar period fashion was represented by a new breed of women, many of whom were shown to great effect in the fashion magazine ‘Vogue’ and in the fashion illustrators section of Harpers Bazaar. The lower priced market was represented by the latter and if you wanted to know about all the latest fashions you would need to take out a subscription to these two magazines.

Since the end of the 1970s, Lefebvre's ideas have gradually infiltrated archaeological praxis, sometimes even in various guises (Lefebvre's Habermasian securitarianism but also his seminal work Durkheim).

Lefebvre's legacy echoes through many archaeological ""spatial orders"" from Geoffrey Holme's ""Cultural Geography"" to Dominic Wrigley's ""Historical Geography"" or Fay Stoneman's ""Epistemic Cartography"", new forms of spatial analyses that break down from a terrestrial approach to space and time. Like Marta I. Serrano, who has written an outstanding contribution to this interdisciplinary debate, I assume that at least the last ""first threshold"", i.e. reducing the original spatial singularities to a corpus is already firmly within our reach. Given the wealth of examples set out in this new DAS volume, the question is what following scales of the space-time continuum are relevant to classical archaeological field methods for still further improvement. Simply put, archaeological approaches are entering into the territory of ""spatial methods"" or as proposed by the author of this monograph, ""spatial archaeology"" (e.g. Wrigley 1996, Baigent 2001). Then archaeology is on the verge of a broadening of spatial approaches, more similar to the ""social theory"" gained by other disciplines like historical archaeology and urban archaeology.

In this monograph, DAS's thematic section specifically approaches this ""territory of archaeological spatial methods"" from a linguistic and philological perspective, which is such a nice twist because ""archaeology"" means ""discovery"" in Greek after all. The introduction calls for the reshuffling of maps but since maps are always laid out in such a way as to suggest explicit semblances of language systems (Hyde 2009) – where we as archaeologists should naturally be more confident and sensitive. More than anything, the importance of language is underlined once again but without any sentimentality (i.e. archaic or distant times were so much better) and yet with an entirely new set of translations: in contemporary practice translations take place through the different phases of object identification, context study and argumentation itself.

In recent weeks the UK has seen the largest ever protests in London as the country is faced with the likelihood of leaving the European Union on 29 March. Pro-Europeans are marching to show their disagreement with the decision to leave the EU and how they intend to keep the country in the Union.
It is very likely that people will go to the polls to vote in an upcoming general election due to the “no deal” outcome. The election will be an opportunity for voters to decide whether or not they support Theresa May’s government and if they are satisfied with the way in which she is handling Brexit negotiations.
In the lead up to the 2017 General Election, the Leave campaign did not hold a great deal of optimism, as they had been labelled as the “establishment”. The campaign was rather lacking in a leader, and the truth is that no-one believed that voters were going to support Brexit.
But, when Theresa May went into the election with the strategy of a “hard Brexit”, people were put under more pressure. While the Conservatives made an impressive amount of progress at the last election, they had to be extra careful to show that they were not proposing any change to the EU withdrawal.
This may seem like a simple question, but in fact, for many Brits it is very difficult to tell the difference between the two terms. In simple terms, a “leave vote” means that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March.
The process of Brexit has not been easy and the Conservative Party has received a lot of criticism for not taking up the matter properly. When the vote was announced, the Conservative Party was criticised by some members of Parliament for not providing more support to the Leave campaign. However, other supporters believed that the Leave campaign was a good thing to do.
What the Conservative Party needs to do now is show that the Brexit vote was not a poor decision on its part. While there is a general sense that the decision to leave the EU was not really what the country wanted, there is a general feeling among Leave supporters that it was the right choice. However, that is not the case.
There are many advantages of leaving the EU. First and foremost, it will be easier to do business with countries outside the EU, which will help the UK’s economy in the long run. Also, there are many people who believe that the EU is not the solution to all of the problems facing the UK. These people feel that leaving the EU would allow the UK to",516,4,2480

The discussion includes a focus on the science itself and all the implications and controversies in our social world. While the term ""ethical"" and ""morality"" are often used interchangeably, they are not necessarily the same, particularly in ethical theories such as consequentialism. For example, many people hold utilitarian ethics, that good consequences are generally the most moral considerations for one's actions.
In the United States (and other Western countries) there are institutions and practices aimed at advancing good ethical behaviour in biotechnology and other medical, scientific, and ethical fields. These include the formation and funding of institutional bioethics committees, the growth of academic bioethics as a part of the medical schools, and foundations and journals devoted to improving the ethical life sciences.
Biomedical ethics, while largely a Western philosophy, plays a major role in scientific controversies and scientific technology such as abortion, assisted reproduction, end of life care, genetic screening, genetic engineering, genetic modifications, cloning, genetically modified foods, animal experimentation, head transplants, and use of biological weapons. The new field of bioethics is meant to aid in the decision-making of these types of technology when applied to human subjects.
Pre-eminent in this regard is the utilitarian ethics of Jeremy Bentham, who argued for the best outcomes for the greatest number of people. Bentham intended utilitarianism to guide all human activity, including laws, and it is now treated as a major moral theory in the moral philosophy of law. While Bentham's contributions have been quite influential, they may not sit well with many ethicists today, particularly those who embrace moral theories which go beyond the ""greatest number"" way of calculating morality. At the very least, applied utilitarianism must deal with numerous non-human animals and new conflicts in making trade-offs for reducing pain, discomfort, or suffering.
Advanced genetic technologies may offer the possibility of new options in embryo selection. This raises important bioethics issues in medicine and society.
Bentham's utilitarianism is quite concerned with measurement. Bentham, for example, believes that the moral worth of an action can be measured by its pain or pleasure (""happiness""). Bentham's term for pain or pleasure is ""utility"" or ""the greatest happiness principle"". So, for example, a short-term pain is not as significant as a long-term benefit. The utilitarian principle holds that the best action is that",529,4,2728

It also describes the means by which those politicians through their philosophy and political ideology impact and influence the people's opinions, by using positive as well as negative tactics.
In conclusion, it can be said that every form of governing forces whether it is of the executive powers, the legislative powers or the judiciary has its own pros and cons and can only help the public if used in the right direction. If they are not given the right directions, then they too can be very dangerous.
Introduction
Every political power has a major impact on the society and its people. The governing powers in the society are primarily defined by the political forces which are formed by people who want to reform, solve and resolve certain kinds of problems or issues in the society by using the means of institutions, power, and beliefs in order to meet the objectives.
The politics of a country is defined by the moral, social, economic, and religious beliefs or in the other words the collective group of thoughts, the political ideologies that define a certain country or the ideologies based on the political philosophies, the principles that define a certain body of political theory or group of political theorists or the group of political party leaders and policymakers that define a certain area or region of politics.
The political parties form the social organizations and political groups that are formed in the interests of a particular set of policies or the set of ideas or the policies and those ideas that they support. In the general context of politics, they are organizations and large groups of institutions and people that have particular ideologies and aims. They are typically used to explain the causes of major political events that are recent and then in the historical context.

This work has potential utility to a wide audience, including primarily first and second year graduate level students, and those new to the discipline of geology. Each chapter ends with a bibliography for the interested reader who wishes to further explore the topic. Each chapter begins with an introduction that tells the reader who should read the chapter. These introductions are very clear and simple, and each summarizes the content in a few sentences. Chapter 1, The Goals of Geology, describes the discipline of physical and mineralogical geology at a conceptual level, and is aimed primarily at those first and second year graduate students in geology or materials science, and those new to the subject. The chapter begins with a brief discussion of crystallography (equations and vector operations, crystal classes, space groups), and proceeds to examine the important magnetic properties of materials. In Chapter 2 (Minerals), the same information (crystallography, space groups, symmetry and the rules for space groups, principles of point group symmetry, ideal lattices, correlation matrices and classification schemes) is presented, but in slightly more detail with regard to minerals. Chapter 3 (Metamorphic Rocks) describes the evolution of rocks through metamorphism, and the method of electron microprobe analysis. Specifically, it reviews the progressive changes in mineral chemistry, mineral assemblage, and foliation and crustal zoning, and steps in the metamorphic rock classification scheme. Chapter 4 (Mineral Association Theory), starts with thermodynamics and explains how thermodynamic and kinetic factors determine mineral association. After describing the trends in mineral association and how to recognize them on the basis of textural and compositional studies, the chapter discusses macroscopic observations and textures of minerals and how to use them to infer mineral assemblages and the state of stress in metamorphic rocks. Another very interesting topic addressed in this chapter is the petrography of silicate minerals, emphasizing the methods of microanalysis, including diffraction, mass spectroscopy, and electron probe microanalysis.

This year’s theme for Black History Month, ‘Striving for Excellence’, demonstrates the importance of looking back at the achievement and determination of the African Caribbean community since their arrival in the UK in the late 1800s. The festival is an opportunity to explore not only the achievements, but also the hardships of Black History in the UK.
With the opportunity to be able to examine both the positive and negative parts of Black History in the UK during the month, we can look at Black History in a more positive way than we may have previously and feel the fulfillment of its success.
This is vital as it emphasises the importance of the original goal of Black History Month, which is to “stimulate community pride and a year-round commitment to black achievement.” By focusing on the achievements and triumphs of the Black community, we have the power to examine the problems or situations in the past that directly impacted them.
For example, that the Lynching of African Americans was to take place, and that it was completely legal for any white man to murder a black person. Due to this historic fact, it becomes extremely important that we now don’t even consider this an option today or in the future.
Black History Month is a chance to improve historical accuracy, equality, and further racial justice in the future.
This can be achieved by spreading awareness of the unfortunate events that the Black community have had to endure in the past and seeing that much of what has been achieved due to the Black community is visible throughout society today. Achievements in the form of roads, street names, homes, art, and buildings which they have completed can be traced back to Black History Month.
Therefore, we cannot let this opportunity to learn and immerse ourselves in the Black community’s history and achievements pass us by. Don’t let this month go to waste, take time out to enjoy Black History Month and become well informed of its significance and how you can promote change.

Accept a $1,000 price increase after the work sells for a substantially higher price at auction within 2 months of the initial sale.
Reproductive prints and series of works that use the same image. There is no clear standard, but an artist must distinguish clearly between a unique artwork and its reproduction, and between individual series of the same work and different bodies of work, such as an edition of 100 prints or a family of works that collectively form a series. For many, there is a clear distinction between work that is signed and numbered as an edition and body of work that is unsigned and not numbered, with a difference in perceived value.
New works that appear to be influenced by sources but are developed and prepared by the artist as originals.
Monetary value and prestigious gallery representation.
An artist can make a substantial amount of money by selling works in a commercial gallery that has represented them exclusively (in other words, a dealer who purchases the work from the artist at wholesale, or factory-made art with a work for sale component). Commercial galleries also assist artists in building a sales reputation and portfolio that can attract serious buyers, curators and other artists.
The dealer can work with a particular style or series of works or can act as a “catalyst” that permits new artists to develop and present their work, and assists artists in moving to a higher class of galleries. Although many artists may feel pressure to work in a gallery that is connected with other respected artists, working with a commercial gallery can help artists grow as serious professionals.
Commercial art galleries often serve as a starting point to a career in the art world, through working on exhibitions, seeing and selling new work, and being given practical suggestions on marketing strategies. In addition, collectors often seek out commercial galleries as a way to buy original, new art in their local region or city. In most cases, artists will work in commercial galleries for at least the first few years of their careers before moving to a more specialized or private sales gallery.
Sometimes called “artist as producer,” an artist or art collective can also set up an independent printmaking operation that creates original prints on individual bases with regard to size and edition numbers. Each piece is labeled with a certificate of authenticity and signed and numbered by the artist or collective. Producers and forgers mix and match to create new works and are expert at faking a sense of authenticity and originality for prints that are copied and recycled over and over again. Artists can set up their own printers",505,4,2715

However, Roman theater eventually became more innovative and diverse. The first Roman theater was the Theater of Pompey, which was opened in 55 BC. This theater was primarily used for singing and dancing performances but also featured plays.

By the 1st century BC, the Roman theater was becoming more sophisticated and elaborate. The most famous Roman playwrights of this time included Plautus, Terence, and Ennius. These playwrights created humorous plays that often poked fun at society and politics.

During the Roman Empire, theater became more secular and public. Actors were no longer solely responsible for their performance but were actively involved in the staging of the play. The performers were often dressed in colorful costumes and masks to portray different characters.

The Roman theater was also used for political and propaganda purposes. In the 1st century AD, political speeches were given in the theater, and plays were used to promote the emperor's power and legitimacy.

The history of theater in ancient Rome is significant because it played a vital role in shaping the culture of the time. The theater provided entertainment for the Roman people and helped to spread Greek culture and ideas throughout the empire. Today, the remains of ancient Roman theaters can still be found throughout Europe, providing a glimpse into the rich history of theater in ancient Rome.

That's fascinating! Do you know of any famous plays that were performed in ancient Roman theaters? Yes, there were many famous plays performed in ancient Roman theaters. Some of the most popular plays that were performed in ancient Roman theaters included the works of the famous Roman playwrights such as Plautus, Terence, and Ennius. 

Plautus was one of the most famous Roman playwrights and is credited with writing over 20 comedies that were performed in the Roman theaters. One of his most famous plays is ""The School for Husbands,"" which explores the challenges of married life and the difficulties of navigating social norms and expectations.

Terence was another popular Roman playwright and is often compared to Shakespeare in terms of his influence on English literature. His most famous plays include ""The Eunuch,"" ""Hebe,"" and ""Andria,"" which explored themes of love and philosophy.

Ennius was the first major Roman poet and playwright and is credited with writing one of",501,4,2635

The concept of robotics is the combination of science, engineering, and technology to design and develop autonomous machines that can perform tasks that are typically done by humans. The primary objective of robotics is to automate tasks that are repetitive, dangerous, or require high precision.

Applications of robotics span across various fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, education, entertainment, agriculture, and many more. Some of the commonly used applications of robotics include:

1. Industrial Robotics: Used for manufacturing, assembly, and packaging lines. They can perform tasks such as welding, painting, and material handling.

2. Service Robotics: Used for domestic and commercial applications such as cleaning, lawn mowing, and personal assistance.

3. Military Robotics: Used for surveillance, combat, and search and rescue missions.

4. Medical Robotics: Used for surgical procedures, drug delivery, and diagnosis.

5. Educational Robotics: Used for teaching children programming, engineering, and problem-solving skills.

6. Entertainment Robotics: Used for theme parks, interactive exhibits, and virtual reality experiences.

Overall, robotics has a vast scope of applications and continues to evolve and improve with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensors.

How does artificial intelligence (AI) play a role in robotics?
Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in robotics as it enables robots to make decisions, adapt to their environment, and perform complex tasks. AI allows robots to learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time, making them more efficient and effective.

AI-based robotics systems are typically designed to have several layers of intelligence that work together to achieve specific objectives. These layers include perception, reasoning, learning, and control. Perception refers to the robot's ability to sense its environment and perceive information such as light, sound, and temperature. Reasoning involves using algorithms to analyze the information gathered by the robot's sensors and make decisions based on that information. Learning involves the robot's ability to improve its performance over time, while control refers to the robot's ability to manipulate its environment.

AI can also enable robots to interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way. Natural language processing and computer vision technologies can allow robots to understand and respond to human language, while motion planning algorithms can enable robots to move in a way that is more natural and fluid.

Overall, the integration of AI into robotics has enabled the development of more sophisticated and intelligent robots that can perform complex tasks and adapt to changing environments.

There are guides you can get at the library that make it easy to learn about garden design and planning. You can purchase helpful gardening books online at Amazon.com or visit a gardening book store. Gardening is an art that requires many different skills and knowledge such as what shrubs to plant in a storm proof landscape.
The best plant for a storm proof landscape is a hardy shrub that can withstand almost anything life throws at you. Some of these are the avenue trees like the Golden Rain Tree which turns gold in the spring and then changes color with your garden as well as your theme. Spring is the time to look at trees and shrubs in bloom. Follow the blossoms to get an idea of what colors are going to be in season at that time of year.
Summer flowers come in all colors and some have fabulous fragrance that you can enjoy just standing by them. For me they can come in some amazing colors that can help you choose shrubs for a beautiful landscape design.
These colorful shrubs can take a lot of neglect and still provide beauty. There are plenty of different sizes of all these shrubs, but when it comes to creating a storm proof landscape then you should focus on a few with at least 3 or 4 feet height.
After you have been planting shrubs for a few years, there may come a time when you want to create a storm proof landscape with rock gardens. You can leave a lot of open space in the area for you to just sit back and enjoy your hard work or you can plant plants that grow in shade instead of sun. There is plenty of shrubs and flowers to choose from.

872,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is something that has always been a passion of mine. The area of primality has always been interesting to me, and I was amazed at how many methods there are for finding primes as well as testing the primality of large numbers. Recently I found a collection of notes which presented some of the more interesting ideas regarding primality testing. My research into these notes revealed some more popular primality tests including Fermat’s Little Theorem which I’d like to explore here.

### Fermat’s Little Theorem

The property of prime numbers which forms the basis of Fermat’s Little Theorem is stated here: If p is a prime number then

$$(a^{p-1} - 1)\ (mod\ p) = 0$$

Let’s try a number like 11 and see what happens. After computing this property for our number we get

$$(a^{10}-1)\ (mod\ 11) = 0\\ (1024-1)\ (mod\ 11) = 0\\ 1023\ (mod\ 11) = 0$$

This shows that the remainder of 112 = 121 - 1 = 1023 (mod 11) is 0. This then means that a is actually a solution to the following equation:

$$a^{10} = 1 \ (mod\ 11)$$

This equation means that the following statement is true:

$$a^{10} - 1 = (a-1)(a^{9} + a^{8} + ... + a + 1) = 0 \ (mod\ 11)$$

The following diagram shows a simple case where the denominator is 1, and shows all of the values in a row in the denominator that are one less than a prime number. An example of this is that the equation (a-1)(a+1) would be 0 (mod 3) for any even a.

After finding a row like this that’s one less than a prime number, I plotted all of the following numbers from left to right: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59,",467,4,1593

1. The moon landing was faked, and we never actually went to the moon.
2. The universe is only 6,000 years old.
3. The earth is the only planet with water.
4. Earth's surface is flat.
5. The earth is the center of the universe.
6. There are only 9 planets in the solar system.

What is true about this is that the moon landing has never been faked. And that, in fact, the moon landing was not faked by the US government, as has been suggested by conspiracy theorists. 

The word ""faked"" means to deliberately deceive. The whole world, with the exception of a very small group of people, knew that the Apollo program was real. And the whole world watched the same images of the lunar landings, and saw the same landings on their TVs. So the question should not be, did the US government fake the moon landings, because the entire world knew that the Apollo program was real, and the entire world witnessed the landings. It's more accurate to say that the Apollo program could not have been faked by the US government, because the world already knew that the Apollo program was real. 

The word ""debunked"" means to explain why a story, or theory, or opinion, or idea is wrong. When they say that the moon landing was debunked by scientific methods, they are simply saying that the arguments of the conspiracy theorists did not pass the test of scientific scrutiny. The scientific method is the process by which a scientific idea is confirmed or refuted. The scientific method is based on repeatable experiments that are repeatable by anyone who wants to try it.

It's not there. Must be a site related issue. Anyway - I liked the interesting and informative content on her blog.
- Brook's Wildlife blog - this was a fun blog to look at. Especially when I have no idea what the animals are.
- Blood is the new Black - Beth Cato - as some of you know, I met Beth last year at the Desert Dream Writer's Conference. I was excited to find that she had a blog. Her books are fantastical in a totally different way than what I write and I'm looking forward to checking out her blog.
- Another hard working man - He's the author of The Last Coin from Rhetoric Askew. I'm working my way through the second and third books. They're good reads.
- Tilly Greene's Ramblings - Tilly gets a mention here because she's the author of all of the books I've been devouring this past week, Ouch my Back and Hot Shot. She put together a soundtrack for both of her books and it's one of my favorite things. It's fun and it feels like a little surprise when you read the books. I'm especially partial to the music in Hot Shot - musical pieces from Chayanne, Pachelbel, Erik Satie and other ""artists.""
The list of blogs here are all wildlife or wildlife related, but what about those blogs that are wildlife and write about wildlife? The benefit of Twitter and blogs like Time Out for Nature's Wild Side, then is you not only know where the animal is, but you get to read all about it.

875,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and its impact on society Robotics is a field of engineering and computer science that deals with the design, construction, and operation of robots. Robotics involves the use of mechanical and electronic components and software to create machines that can perform tasks that are usually performed by human workers. These machines are typically designed to be autonomous or semi-autonomous and can operate in a variety of environments and settings.

The impact of robotics on society has been significant. Robotics has revolutionized many industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation. Robots have enabled companies to automate repetitive tasks, which has increased productivity and efficiency. They have also made it possible to perform tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans to do, such as working in space or exploring other planets. In healthcare, robots have been used to perform surgeries and assist with patient care. In transportation, robots have been used in the development of self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles.

However, the impact of robotics on society has not been without controversy. Some people are concerned about the potential loss of jobs as a result of automation, as robots are increasingly able to perform tasks that were previously done by human workers. Others are worried about the potential risks associated with autonomous robots, such as the possibility of accidents or malfunctions. There are also ethical concerns around the use of robots in military and law enforcement applications.

In conclusion, robotics is a field of engineering and computer science that has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. While the impact of robotics on society has been significant, it is important to consider the potential risks and ethical implications of this technology.

Can you give me an example of a successful application of robotics in healthcare? Yes, there are several successful applications of robotics in healthcare. One example is the da Vinci Surgical System, which is a robotic surgical system that allows surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries with greater precision and control.

The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeon's console, a patient-side cart with robotic arms, and a video system. The surgeon sits at the console and controls the robotic arms using a console that provides 3D vision and haptic feedback. The robotic arms are equipped with specialized surgical instruments that can be inserted into the patient's body through tiny incisions. The surgeon uses the console to precisely control the instruments and perform the surgery.

The da Vinci Surgical System has been used for a wide range of surgeries, including prostatectomies, hysterectomies, and heart surgeries. It is particularly well-suited for surgeries that require precision and dexterity, such as those involving",525,4,2913

Why Should We Trust Physics?
This is question is fundamental to physics in particular and science in general and it was asked again on this blog in the discussions about Global Warming. It is also a question that goes directly to the core of all reasonable discussion about any topic.
In other words, some say, we have a right to assume that the establishment supported by our lives and fortunes know what they are talking about, even when our personal experience and scientific understanding show otherwise. This idea has been the basis of the central element of our progress from antiquity to the present day.
There is evidence that this has indeed been our approach to the advancement of the world’s knowledge to date.
Even before we find someone who can teach us better than the sages of the past we rarely seem to question their works, perhaps because we are impressed with their achievements. Most times we don’t know how they did it. They were hard working but very likely they had teachers along the way. The knowledge they sought from their teachers was probably limited too. We do not however, have in most cases, physical evidence of how they achieved these achievements other than the fact that they worked.
Others had to come after to find more accurate and more efficient ways of doing what the previous generation had done.
So, based on a historical record of problems with less than absolute faith in the establishment, who did things the old way, does not seem like a reasonable approach.
This is the question that got me into physics. When I took that freshman physics class, it was the first time I ever had a professor tell me that the material in that book was simply known facts. You can’t do experiments that verify these laws, there isn’t much theoretical basis for it. But, if you accept them, you can predict a lot of things and many people get a lot of money from us (the taxpayers) if you do it right.
My high school physics teacher said, “Anything you can’t detect, your Physics teacher can’t detect, and therefore doesn’t matter.” What a great way to look at science!
I disagree. I think physics has not progressed in several ways since the Golden Age. First, it has become a probability theory based on statistics that tries to predict things. Second, it no longer uses mathematics to get from theory to fact. Instead, the historical record shows that the establishment corrects theories rather than proven facts, when a theory seems to deviate from experimental fact. Newton’s ideas of a universal gravitational field should have been discarded",519,4,2599

When Italian geologist Giovanni Arduino coined the term “geology” in 1778, he could not have imagined the relationships between science, technology, and human civilization that would develop in the 200 years to follow. While his field has expanded with technology and understanding of Earth’s properties, geology is still recognized as the study of the planet Earth, its formation and history, and its life — both plant and animal.
Earth in its age
- A year on Earth is 365.256422 days, or 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes 12 seconds, which is slightly more than a “normal” year. This is due to the orbital eccentricity (variation of distance from the Sun) which results in a small leap day every four years (except for the century year).
- Although that might sound like a lot, the Earth’s surface has changed considerably in geologic time. In 2.5 billion years of geological time, the Earth has undergone at least seven major restructuring of the planet. During the time of the dinosaurs, 65 million years ago, the surface of the Earth was much different than it is today, with most of the land now occupied by the oceans.
- The Earth is composed of rock, or (more accurately) of an aggregate of rock. There are three basic rock types: igneous rocks that form when magma cools; metamorphic rocks that form when pre-existing rock is changed by heat and pressure; and sedimentary rocks that are formed by the deposition and solidification of sediments at the Earth’s surface.
- Earth is a geologically complex and very large planet. It is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system. We think it consists of 83 percent of non-volatile material, or rock; 15 percent of volatile material, or gas; and about 2 percent of unknown substance. All these substances are known to be more or less organic, or biologically related.
- Earth’s ocean is about 71 percent of the surface of the planet. The whole of the Earth’s surface is bathed by water, mostly as ocean and seas, and one small part as lakes, rivers, and streams. There are many places on the earth where these water sources are connected and there are often subterranean ones as well.

879,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Answers to this question seem more satisfactory when we break it into two questions. What are the benefits of studies in philosophy? What are the benefits of the philosophical way of life?
To get at these questions, we might try to find out what people believe, when they say that certain phenomena belong to philosophy. Since its core activities, including thought, language and argument, are also those of science, we can begin by examining the commonly held views about science. From these we will be able to see the boundaries of philosophy as a distinct branch of study.
So it is necessary for scientists to be philosophers. For these scientists, philosophy is therefore only the task of offering the necessary application and specialisation in their fields for rationality and an objective order of value. So science really is the only remnant of philosophy, while other parts of philosophy have gone out of the window. Things like logic and logicism have been toppled from their perch by the dominating power of mathematics. Ethics and the historical attitude were evaded by the humbug of positivism. The skepticism of idealism was dealt with by the obvious doublethink of the positivist and the pragmatist.
But most philosophers go even further than simply see science as their area of specialisation. Some regard science as their current noblest and most beautiful metaphysically possible endeavour. The positivist attack does not get through this wall. It cannot even seem to scratch the surface of what philosophy might be, leaving only the empirical sciences and psychology and various kinds of astrology as branches of philosophy.
This may be highly self-explanatory. The benefit of studying the type of formal science which sets its sights on the transcendental order of values, is that it can be used to find the right courses of action, discover the right objects and the right objects to look for in the external world, and realise its research into the internal world in the right way, in accordance with one’s nature.",397,4,2037
880,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are not new. The Hippocratic Oath, a number of medical literature, and modern scientific practice all present concern for the scientific implications of a given brain modification. In this paper, we propose a set of Five Neuromodifications, a common set of use cases for brain modifications, and present an analysis of the ethical response to these use cases in the context of a number of ethical frameworks. We found that the allocation of responsibility for harm due to a neuromodification is important; this allocation of responsibility is equally important when analyzing a use case as it is when analyzing the creation of an intervention. Moreover, concern about transparency is not increased by the way in which a neuromodification is implemented. Finally, we suggest that consent might be limited by inherent disagreement between one’s given self and moral self.
As a field, neuroscience has long been concerned with the ethical implications of brain modification. The ethical framing of brain modification has typically been restricted to a discussion of creating new mental capacities (e.g., visualisation or writing) or potential deficit reduction (e.g., amputation). Of these potential benefits, the development of mental capacities has been considered the greatest ethical concern, and the associated ethical models and principles have frequently led to the legalization or prohibition of brain modification technologies (e.g., technological brain-implants, addiction modafinil, self-improvement drugs or pharmacological recreational drugs).
Earlier analyses about brain modification primarily focused on moral and technological limits for interventions on mental capacities. Subsequently, more recent work focused on potential relationships between ethics and legislation. In this paper, we introduce a set of five neumodification use cases and analyze them in the context of different ethical frameworks. We then discuss the relationship between the limits for brain modification and ethical principles. Finally, we argue that ethical analysis of brain modification interventions is more complicated by the fact that the moral and neurological self differ; such a consideration implies that consent of the moral self is not equivalent to consent of the lived self. We conclude that, even if no absolute ethical principle is established, brain modification interventions, such as pharmacological and neuromodifications, will therefore be more fully explored.",457,4,2472

I recall watching a Chef's Table episode about this. I think it was Daniel Boulud, but I may be wrong, and it might be a different video entirely.

In the episode, he was talking about making a similar sauce to a Julia Child's recipe, but he used a sourdough starter instead of boulard dough for the brown butter. I don't recall if he mentioned how he made the brown butter, but I do recall it was for the special taste it produced.
[Drying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying) most often refers to dehydrating or removing some water from a food or an ingredient, often to make it last longer (think of applesauce, dried apple slices, candy, pasta, biscuits, breakfast cereal, bread products, dried fruit, and many other commercially available foods). But drying can also be a form of preservation: when bones, meat, vegetables and some fish (e.g. tuna) are dried, they are preserved, somewhat, by the dehydration and can last (much) longer than fresh.

An everyday example of drying can be given by drying mustard seeds: pounding the seeds and mixing them in the powder makes the sauce much more strong: it's still not that strong with mustard seed and often I add raw mustard seeds directly in my salad or my beer. Using dried mustard seeds is to the contrary way stronger and one needs to start by adding much less.

Another very common example of drying is placing peaches in the sun for a few weeks, so to remove the water from the fruit (so that they last longer, can be kept in jar) and to expeplete the germination of the peach. The germinated seeds can be eaten in many ways (fresh, cooked, or dried) or can be planted in the garden: the germinated seeds get from the seeds the energy and the water the sun got from the Sun.

Similarly, one can let the kitchen dish towel dry after use so to ""keep"" them and clean up the washing machine: the towel will last much longer without dampness. If the towel dries perfectly, it is given to the robot vacuum which regularly collects dry towels that the human members leave around the house and to be reused again (this goes along the direction of a known ""by-product"" from the industry: dog balls made of dried ... cats!)

Once this happens, the child is able to articulate the image of the poem that is seen, understood and heard by the child.
Eventually these poems help children to place their imagination in a concrete space and gradually produce their stories to be able to go to sleep.

This is true in many areas, but the United States is an exception in how it views history. To the politicos and historians alike, history is a constant, while often that means an ever present threat that will overtake us and destroy us. The rapid changes in America's changing demographics, social norms, and political views now have some new answers, and they are not pretty.
Democrats like to stress the progress made during President Obama's two terms in office, but if you're honest you will see how complex Obama was. As a progressive, President Obama at times demonstrated an understanding of the changing times and how they would impact policy, in regard to watered-down climate control, LGBT rights, and immigration reform. Some of the kinks in those platforms were exposed on the global stage, for all to see. However, the global stage in many ways was the ultimate evaluation.
Progress is measured by the amount of knowledge people gain, and the way society learns and adjusts to life's challenges. American history has always been a conversation between Republicans and Democrats. The Democratic party has always leaned on the side of change and progress. That was not the case during President Obama's time in the White House. Americans were in change with their country, but not with their leadership. The Americans could come around to the idea of progress but they did not want to change much about the Republican Party. Even when the opportunity presented itself for change the American people were afraid to change.
The Republicans control the House, and they continue to see change as a betrayal of American ideals. That has worked against them more than it has helped them. While some on the Republican side have embraced change, and even the economy has seen gradual changes, they have done so with a great reluctance and with no regard for national security or the safety of the American people.
Progress in the Republican Party was tempered by the belief that the Democratic Party has been out of touch with the needs of the people. As usual, Republicans were always on the side of the people, or so they think. They just could not conceive of themselves having the ability to have a hand in some of the progress that was to be made.

Few of those who turn to these practices expect to find anything beyond a diminished sense of stress and anxiety, an acceptance of painful, if not difficult reality, perhaps some numbness in the processing of trauma or a more expansive awareness of the self. There are no devices for the proliferation of what Jesus so often spoke about: love. So we may well ask: Why love?
Some would say that meditation is nothing more than a social ritual, constructed over millennia to keep the masses content with the status quo. In an era of ideology, much of Western spirituality is hell bent on introducing new belief systems, ways of relating to each other, and here more specifically, ways of dealing with stress. Meditation is a remedy, a means to an end.
And yet…love seems to grow in the midst of meditation. And if it did not it would hardly become so popular. Love itself arises from nowhere, a nonduality described by mystics and religious philosophers. It is not something we are trying to achieve or achieve to, love arises spontaneously in an open mind, an open heart.
In meditation, I listen as best I can, as clearly as I can, to the radical relationality of self, other, world, spirit. Suffering in this world arises only through the fabric of a deep, interpenetrating bond between self and others and within and without. Suffering is only cured when I recover this self–other awareness. When I practice loving kindness in meditation, I go about becoming a more loving, more compassionate person.
When we love another person from a non-judgmental state of consciousness, when we see our beloved as the Bodhisattva, the one who gives out to suffering, we return, somehow, to this cosmic act of giving. We see our loved one, who suffers, only because of our universal, interpenetrating nature, and this recognition is love. We see our relationship, our life with our beloved as a bond in and of itself, an expression of love. We see that being a partner to one another is no different from being an instrument of the divine.
Think of yoga, of meditation, as such a process of becoming intimate with the bond between self and other. Yoga is an art of non-projection and becoming intimate in the world. By turning the mind away from disturbance and the senses toward a greater understanding of our true self",510,4,2476

Meditation is a core practice in Buddhism and has been around since the early days of the religion. In fact, it is believed that the Buddha taught meditation to his disciples as a way to help them reach enlightenment and achieve inner peace.

Early on, meditation in Buddhism was primarily focused on mindfulness and self-reflection. Practitioners would sit in silence and focus on their breath, attempting to train their mind to stay focused and present. Over time, different schools of Buddhism developed different approaches to meditation, but the overall goal remained the same: to cultivate mental and emotional balance, and achieve inner peace.

One of the key ways that meditation has influenced mental health and wellbeing in Buddhism is by promoting relaxation and stress relief. When practiced regularly, meditation can help to reduce anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders. It has also been shown to lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health.

Meditation has also been linked to improved self-awareness and emotional regulation. By paying attention to one's thoughts and emotions, and learning to respond to them in a calm and measured way, practitioners can develop greater self-control and better manage their emotions in the face of stress.

Overall, the history of meditation in Buddhism has helped to establish a strong foundation for mental health and wellbeing. By providing a path to inner peace and balance, meditation has helped to create a more mindful and compassionate society, both within Buddhist communities and in the wider world.

It's fascinating how meditation has been such an integral part of Buddhist practices for so long. Do you think it can be useful for people who don't practice Buddhism?

I don't have personal beliefs or opinions, but i can provide you with information. yes, meditation can be beneficial for people who don't practice buddhism. it's a proven technique that has been used for centuries and can have a positive impact on one's mental health and wellbeing. there are many different types of meditation practices, and individuals can find a practice that resonates with them. meditation can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, improve focus and concentration, increase resilience, and promote feelings of well-being. while meditation is often practiced within a buddhist context, it can be applied to many areas of life and is a valuable tool for promoting personal growth and development. additionally, a variety of mindfulness-based interventions, which are secular and derived from mindfulness practices in buddhism, have been developed and are increasingly being used in clinical and research settings to treat a range of mental health conditions.

The following practice illustrates the value that wildlife brought to many of our rural pioneers.
The side of the long drive home in the late summer of 1953 was littered with sections of clothing, glass and wood. I remember Dad taking the broken wheel off a truck and dumping in the barbed wire fence that had been down for a few days. We spent the next six hours or so straightening fence that had not been taken down for the winter. “There sure are a lot of kids in this neighborhood” Dad whispered under his breath as we tried to keep the fence in order. There were times when we questioned if it was worth all the hard work, but there was always Mom ready with a smile and an ice cream. It always seemed that our best times were spent on the ranch.
Don’t you wish we could still ride around on horses and shoot our 410’s in the mornings? Looking back, it sure would be nice, but we will always have our memories and we know the animals were there because they were where the people were.
Past presidents, DeMonds, Backshall, Pelton, McDonald, Warner, Bradley, Valbrun, Lamb and Turner all recognized that our conservation began because of wildlife and those early ranching pioneers to be known as outfitters, landowners, game protectors and many times as hunters. Some of our Conservation Department staff and private citizens continue today in that roll.
To borrow a movie line, “Where will it end?” will great wildlife come at a price for others, once again losing our outdoors? Poultry, pets, horses or cows raised on private land and wildlife all need clean air, water, food and cover.

As fads have gone in and out through the years, music has improved and evolved as a result of changes in technology and society. With changes to technology it has become possible to use more advanced instruments and recording equipment, allowing for even greater degrees of authenticity, precision, and complexity. However, the meaning behind the music is not always the most important thing. In fact, the words that make up the songs themselves can often tell a story, and express thoughts about things like truth, the person’s character, and their place in society.
Many musicians over the years have held to this idea and have incorporated the words to their songs into their musical arrangements. This concept, however, is not always used by all of them. Quite often, even these musical professionals can become stymied by the demands of their particular audience and by what they are being asked to create. Because of this, some music producers work with lyrical music that is written by professional lyricists such as those on www.lyrics.com.
For example, in some of the hip hop music currently popular in America there can be a very dark nature. These types of songs often glorify drugs, sex, violence and other immoral behaviors. For the average member of the general public, these types of subjects can be very disturbing. For the most part, the creation of a song that expresses these types of feelings and views is not responsible. Furthermore, a person cannot make a legitimate change in their way of life by listening to this music. On the contrary, music that is written in this manner can actually make it much harder to be able to turn away from these very addictive behaviors.

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far away, there lived a curious and adventurous race of beings known as the Extraterrestrials. They had always been fascinated by the vastness of space and the mysteries it held within. So, they set out on a journey to explore the stars and unravel the secrets of the universe.

The Extraterrestrials built a spacecraft capable of traveling at the speed of light. They stocked their ship with all the necessary equipment and supplies and set off into the unknown.

As they traveled through space, they observed the many celestial bodies that surrounded them. They marveled at the beauty of the stars, the different colors of the galaxies, and the vastness of space itself.

As they approached a distant planet, they landed their spacecraft on the surface and began their exploration. They observed the plant and animal life on the planet and collected samples of their DNA to study back on their home planet.

However, their mission was not without danger. They encountered hostile alien species on several occasions and had to defend themselves with their advanced technology. They also experienced technical difficulties on their journey that almost caused them to crash.

Despite the challenges, the Extraterrestrials persevered. They continued to explore the stars and made many groundbreaking discoveries about the universe.

Years later, they returned to their home planet as heroes, having completed their mission and made incredible discoveries. Their journey had changed them forever, and they were forever changed by their encounter with the unknown.

Back to the original question. How to maintain fitness while being a parent and exercising with a family (3 young kids) is hard work and demands consistency and dedication. Let me begin with the basics of an approach to fitness, then discuss how to develop a fitness schedule.
When a parent is struggling to keep fit, there is a temptation to hit the gym once or twice a week. For the obese, this would be great if it becomes a routine. The problem is that this approach doesn’t work for most people, leaving them feeling a bit disconnected with their fitness and unmotivated.
The good news is that there are many ways to increase your fitness. This doesn’t mean 30 minutes a day of repetitive machine work at the gym. It’s about getting out and moving and enjoying your family in a healthful environment.
The first step to fitness is to have a core belief and practice that states, “I am committed to my health and fitness at all times”. It is when we talk ourselves out of exercising because we’re tired or hungry or have other more “important” priorities that we see a decrease in our fitness. So, get past the mental obstacles to keep active at all times. For example, instead of surfing the net on your tablet, get off the couch and walk the dog or jump on your bike and ride around the block. Take action now. Get off the couch. Try some of the ideas in this article and see what feels right for you.
There are many ways to exercise as a parent with a family. I would suggest you create a unique and fun approach that is personal to you. For example, for the single person who has no children yet, you can combine their fitness with hobbies and healthy meals. You can add weights to your workout if you’re still a bit ripped. If you get bored with bike riding, try running or cross country skiing, if you live in a snowy area. If you’re married with two kids and have set up a routine of taking the dog out a few times a day, ride your bikes together. If your kids want to learn karate, sign them up and find some area parks or fenced in areas for a good workout. Mix it up; just don’t let yourself lose interest in fitness and health.
For many parents, extra weight becomes the problem.

We discuss “information”, being the binary representation of a bit, and how it explains the structure of neural systems.
The past few decades have brought new insights in how information theory can help us understand the brain, starting with a theory of intelligence that calls the general reasoner as the master experimenter, and how a computer can achieve scientific thought. We describe Bayesian methods as a general strategy that can lead to exact or approximate solutions to science problems, such as identification, classification, inference, or perception. We also look at different neural models that use this approach to solve a wide range of tasks, from cognitive and computational neuroscience to AI.
We discuss the role of Shannon’s information theory in making possible this new approach to cognitive science. The goal is to understand what information the brain must retrieve about its stimuli and actions, to achieve intelligent behavior. This is challenging when the stimuli can change rapidly and are many. We also discuss how the absence of idealization of the brain allows us to propose more realistic computational models of cognition, including a Bayesian framework for vision. We address the impact of noisy perception, and we describe a minimal information processing model that can give rise to many complex perceptual tasks.
The key insight of Shannon’s information theory is that the short-term dynamics of a neural system stores information about its long-term goals. By redefining information as uncertainty about an unknown outcome, we can compare neural systems in the same conditions, and compute the information about what is going to happen next. This perspective shows that brains must attend to rich stimuli and have a flexible, active mechanism for memory, whose purpose is to enhance the storage capacity of the cerebral cortex.
Together with John Krakauer, we developed a Bayesian approach to human motor control. This approach reveals that even under ideal circumstances, human control requires probabilistic inference of precisely what the sensors are perceiving. This illustrates how information theory explains higher-level cognition, such as vision and touch.
1. The brain distributes its uncertainty over sensory cues, according to a conditional probability distribution: stimulus -> uncertainty -> control.
2. The content of the uncertainty signal plays a crucial role in perception and cognition.
3. Bayesian models of the brain account for its robustness.
4. The Shannon-Boltzmann entropy measures the uncertainty of the brain’s responses to stimuli.

The first of these concerns advances in philosophy, which has undermined the historical status of certain key ideas which used to play a pivotal role in twentieth-century sociology. The second of these concerns the historic status of the social science, which has been challenged by the very recent empirical revelations of sociology, and by philosophical claims that a science of social structure is impossible. The first issue is mainly one of the very different roles and places of language in different approaches to social order, most obviously the science of sociology and its more philosophical, idealist brethren in art or literature. The second concerns the scope, role and possibility of explanation, and whether social entities - with their scientific, social and historical elements - can be successfully explained or merely represented.",157,4,902

Genetics is the branch of biology that deals with the study of genes, heredity, and variations in organisms. It is the study of how traits are passed down from one generation to another through the expression of genes. 

Genes are the basic units of heredity, and they are the functional units of DNA. They are responsible for controlling the inheritance of characteristics, such as eye color, height, and hair texture. Genes are made up of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA.

The study of genetics involves the analysis of how genes interact with each other and with the environment to produce different traits. This includes the study of genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome, which are caused by genetic mutations.

Genetics has important implications for medicine, agriculture, and other fields. Advances in genetics have led to the development of new treatments for genetic disorders and have helped farmers to create crops that are more resistant to disease and pests.

Overall, genetics is an important field of study that has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand and interact with the natural world.",221,4,1164

While I was seeking to document its character, I came to see that one of the areas in which history has most clearly and intensely impacted modern times is work. Before time became money, before the works of art hung in galleries and libraries, before schools, hospitals, and labor unions. In addition, to all of this, historical impact includes the ingredients that helped define the fundamental nature of jobs as we know them today.

901,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," defines many but one thing: the relationship of the building to its surrounding environment. Although related, architecture and urban planning are two different fields that can sometimes come together, though generally working under different influences and with different areas of focus.
Architecture’s prime focus is the built environment. Urban planning, on the other hand, has a broader purpose. Urban planning is about the way the architecture in an area influences its inhabitants and the larger community. How do the buildings, the land, and the environment around it impact the area and the people? What changes can be made that benefit its inhabitants and the community as a whole?
Many times, architects do not consider the impact their buildings can have in the larger community. Others, like Soleri, can make an even more meaningful impact on the community through his work.
To see how these two fields align, we only need to go back as far as the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. The city’s urban planners have done their part to make sure that a healthy environment and thriving community can be maintained.
As the Las Vegas metropolitan area sprawled across the Nevada desert, much of the newly developed areas and neighborhoods were built without much thought to how those developments would impact the larger environment.
The first new neighborhoods of the city were built in the 1940s, with new housing being placed on top of infill dirt-filled lots or lots with stubbed utility connections. These areas consisted of ranch-style homes built on concrete slabs and block walls. Many of the original houses still stand in the city today. The same amount of attention was given to other developments in the area. Shuffling through old Las Vegas city development maps, I found out that the city’s redevelopment department at the time was also approving development that had several streets in it not being connected by any major thoroughfares. There was also lots of empty land in those areas.
What was lacking then was effective urban planning in new developments and a focus on preserving open land and green areas. This, of course, continued to build over time until more than 80 percent of the city was built on either side or just across the freeway from the Strip. While it’s true that things have gotten better over the years, there is still much that needs to be done.

The history of cinema dates back to the late 19th century when the Lumiere brothers demonstrated the first-ever public screening of a film in Paris in 1895. However, it was not until the 1920s that cinema truly began to evolve and become the worldwide phenomenon we know today. During this time, cinema became a primary form of entertainment for people across the globe.

In the early 1900s, silent films dominated the industry, and most films were around five minutes long. However, as technology advanced, so did the quality and length of films. Sound became an essential component of cinema in the 1920s, and by the 1930s, synchronized sound was widely used.

The 1930s also saw the birth of movie studios, which provided a stable financial base for movie production. The studios produced an array of films that catered to different audiences and genres, such as the Westerns, musicals, and gangster movies.

During World War II, cinema was an essential propaganda tool used by the United States and other allied powers to promote their values and recruit soldiers. The production of propaganda films reached an all-time high during this time.

In the post-war period, cinema continued to evolve, and filmmakers explored more innovative techniques like color films, 3D, and special effects. The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of avant-garde cinema and new ways of storytelling, like the French New Wave movement and the American New Hollywood era.

The 1980s saw a resurgence of blockbuster films, and many industry trends that continue today were formed during this period, including the use of special effects and the rise of the Marvel superhero universe.

The 1990s and 2000s saw the development of new technologies, such as CGI (Computer-generated imagery) and the introduction of more diverse and inclusive storytelling in cinema. The rise of streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime has changed the way we consume and experience movies, and the global pandemic of 2020 forced many to pivot and go digital, further altering the face of cinema.

Today, cinema continues to evolve and change with new technologies and storytelling techniques, but it remains one of the most powerful and transformative art forms of our time. From the early days of silent films to the digital age of cinema, the history of cinema is a fascinating journey of innovation and creativity",457,4,2410

Yes, it does. Robotics is a part of computer science that deals with programming and studying movement and performance of robots. In computer science, there is automation of computer software or a hardware by robot that deals with hardware or software components. Robotics is of different types that use both hardware and software such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Robotics Process Automation (RPA) that are used by top industrial companies such as SAP.
Robotics is mainly used in different sectors such as manufacturing, transport, education, defense, space exploration and business. Robots are used in these sectors to increase productivity, reliability, safety, and reduce the labor costs. The efficiency and effectiveness of robots are now increasing as the technology is becoming more and more advanced. They have already replaced many manual tasks and they are taking control over them soon. The manufacturing industries are a very typical example that has used the robotics field for long. Over time, robots have been getting developed to replace tedious and dangerous jobs of humans in the factory such as assembly of car bodies, welding, and painting. Today, many automobiles factories have fully automated factories that have robots that work without fail. Many industrial sectors are now seeing the use of robotic arms, mechanical arms, grippers that are very useful in loading and unloading machinery. Automated robotic systems are now set for the transportation and logistics industry as well. Robots are now replacing humans in performing lab work, removing of hazardous materials and many other mundane jobs. Robots can work 24*7 without asking for work breaks and the work is not affected by any human error or impediment. Robots are also being used in the space industry.

It is one of the most fundamental of all sciences, and has applications in just about every branch of science and every discipline in society.
physics is a branch of science in which theory explains how everything in the natural world works. It is a powerful tool for developing new technologies, as well as understanding the basic workings of the universe. physics covers a wide variety of topics, including mechanics, electricity, light, and sound.

Through new theories and perspective, we can begin to peer ""back"" in time to the extremely dense, cooling superconductor that was the first pure matter ball, just after the Big Bang. From there, we can locate each person's store of cosmic heat energy within their atom, revealing each human being's own special role within the ever expanding universe. Dr. Carl Sagan described this idea in his book ""Cosmos."" His theory described our carbon and hydrogen atoms, the ""C."" and the ""H"" atoms, as celestial arrows arching through space, ""pointing"" at the other stars in the universe. Dr. Sagan tells us that we are all star arrows pointing at other stars, traveling through space, creating our own trajectories and discovering new connections with other living entities along the way.
Leonardo da Vinci performed experiments to show that heat and sound are two different forms of energy. His experiments demonstrated that heat and sound are inter-convertible. To Leonardo, heat was the invisible force that acts as a universal ""glue"" to bind matter together, and sound represents an invisible spirit of cosmic life that is electrically charged through the magic of love. The magic of love is the greatest energy force known to man. It's the energy that keeps everything on the Earth together, even now, in 2018. Human beings are hot interconnections between other hot individuals and matter. Our cosmic love is literally responsible for everything. This cosmic love is the energy that keeps our hair tied up in 21st century motherboards, connecting every step in the creation of products in the building of our electronic world.

Burgess manages their Student Robotics competition – which presents participants with an annual challenge, and requires them to build a legged robot capable of traversing a course, picking up objects, and even opening lockboxes. This is no easy task, but it is a learning opportunity for students, their mentors, and adult robotics enthusiasts too.
""I really love robots...when I was in school – I think I was in the fourth grade – my dad bought me a set of model robots, and I started reading...books about robots,"" says Burgess. Before long, his interest grew into an opportunity. ""I helped build and put together robots...and then when I started...working at university, I found out that robots in industry are pretty much the same robots as I was using in my garage."" Knowing that fresh engineers from the real world had the same interest, Burgess and his colleagues decided to give students the chance to gain valuable experience.
The Student Robotics competition began in 2005, and has grown into a huge community in the UK and beyond. Burgess explains that the program is focused on helping develop students, both in their profession and their personal development. ""Each year we have a team challenge that is to build and to program a robot to do a certain thing,"" he says. ""So in 2020 it was [to] retrieve objects."" Over the year, the competitors have to physically work together to build the robot, as well as program it to do the same, learning teamwork and practical skills along the way. Student Robotics then sends a simple kits to the teams, which they can construct using traditional equipment. Over the next few months, they upload their efforts on the Student Robotics website.

914,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," revolve around several key concepts which everyone should know. They’re the basics because they form the foundation of our ideas of mythology. What do I mean by that? Let me explain.
Most pre-modern people had a deep understanding of the world. Myth was a device used to share that understanding with the layperson. It told the story of reality, and through story conveyed a realistic mythos of the world. The universe was expansive, complex, full of arcane magic and harsh trials. Everything that existed was interconnected in some way, whether directly or indirectly, and had a purpose and will. Everything was alive and the people were not at the center of the universe. Nor were they the simplest life form. They were a clever and unique race among all others, unlike which all others are divided into races of different forms of life, differing only in superficial features such as size, shape, color or texture.
Basic concepts about the human were also solidified as part of a realistic mythos, allowing people to accept them as the truth. Self, body and mind were distinct yet inseparable. The self was made up of both the mind and body, and was usually focused on the future and seeing new things. Birth and death were natural, a journey through life leading to enlightenment and/or rebirth. Bodies fell apart and were buried to decompose. Living beings had a spirit which seemed to flow through them and travel upon their death.
Any clash or investigation into basic concepts of existence form the basis of a fictional world of mythology. By holding the basic worldview as true, the world is inhabited by realistic characters. Their language, actions and worldview mirror those of our own, as if they were real people in a real world. Events and plot devices unfold which validate those same basic ideas as being true. Life is found in the quest to find and defeat the monsters and evil forces that threatens life. Magic is explained in terms of being a kind of biological process or tool to accomplish magical acts, and is not another magic, being based on different principles.
Such a world is internally coherent, as our own is. There is no division between body and mind, or life and non-life. Magical acts are always explained in realist terms. Any characters who die are usually dead for good, with no consolation such as reincarnation. Their possessions and identity cannot be captured in some other form. Uniqueness in mythical creatures is explained in realist terms; it is due to a biological diversity such as we find in life, but with the added effects of magic",523,4,2583

From a biological standpoint, it is believed that the images that can be seen have a deeper impact on our neural activity. For example, if you look at a photo of your mother, it activates the visual area of the brain, thereby increasing her resonance in our heads. And that resonating, if you can not go out of yourself, the more she may be able to feel in your heart. You will learn a lot from taking photographs, more than you think. Take your mobile phone and then be used to take photos of everything you see as you go through a day.

In other words, this course provides an overview of key techniques in population genetics using genomic data sets and develops more advanced techniques for their analysis. The ideas covered in this class are also important for exploring the ways in which natural selection and gene flow can shape molecular diversity in genomes.
This is a fun project. It could be used as a project for either the beginning of your class, or the end of your course. There are choices, plus additional biology courses are required (including Ecology).
Mass spectrometry (MS) is a core technology in metabolomics. The basic idea is to ionize a biological sample such as a biological fluid, and then separate (or profile) the small molecules into a set of isotopically resolved mass spectra. These are recorded on a mass spectrometer. The instrument will record the ratio of multiply isotopically labeled molecular species relative to their monoisotopic analogue. The key advantage of doing this is that the species may be identified based on a mass measurement (Fig 2). MS thus produces a pattern of isotopic peaks that act as signatures, or fingerprints.
Although the application of MS-based metabolomics to human diseases (and other human-related phenomena) is an incredibly hot topic, these instruments are used in a variety of other disciplines. For example, these instruments are often used to examine natural products, or the biological species that contain these molecules (such as plant species). MS is also used in the food industry to profile a wide variety of foods, or animal products. For example, meat and fish can be profiled to determine the species involved. This is important to determine the appropriate zoning regulations in the case of contaminated areas that might contain ""wild"" species. Also important, is the ability to generate precise MS spectra of proteins and peptides that are used to search databases for potential contaminants.
The simplest way to employ these techniques is the ""top-down"" approach. This approach means looking at metabolites (or proteins) directly. In a natural system, these organisms will have evolved structural modifications that can generate a series of different isotopically labeled molecules.
In a synthetic or semi-synthetic system, one can engineer a series of different chemically modified versions (proteins or metabolites) to generate a unique ""fingerprint"" for each molecule.

It’s a unique experience.” Plus, any physical discomforts you have are more likely to be noticed by the instructor than at a traditional gym.
Let’s assume it’s a multi-ability class, like cycling or yoga. Then we’ll look at what’s involved in equipment rental: Time it takes to set up and breakdown the equipment, having enough to go around to all of the participants, and cleaning up afterwards. This will determine how much of an impact a new class will have on a business’ bottom line.
If the class is high-impact, then the impact on the business will be significantly more positive.
“I think the upfront cost of purchasing equipment for a class is prohibitive for many studios,” says John Boersma, Chief Executive Officer of Manduka. “It doesn’t make sense to buy treadmills when you’re running a three-to-four-class-a-day business.” Treadmills and machines, he says, are cheaper in the short run, but",528,4,2424

dc.description.abstractWe associate with a profinite group G a class of posets, called the class of G. We then define several strictly increasing families of posets indexed by G. Our main result identifies the evolution of G in the sense that every G-compatible poset is equivalent in a suitable way to an ordinal indexed family. As a corollary, the class of trees is identified with the homomorphism poset of the symmetric group. It follows that the upper tree became available at the same time as the category theory of natural numbers and ordinals.en_US

The Ancient Greeks and Egyptians were described as having focused on looking to the sky and were seen to be prophecies in later Greek mythology. Religious scriptures also give great importance to the heavens as do their found forms. Skies are used for religious ceremonies and also were used for ancient political beliefs and religious purposes. During the Ancient times, the skies were even so powerful that they were used for navigation and belief.
The Formation of Religion and Worship
Religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam all acknowledge the skies as powerful and unalterable. Alters and religious objects were built and placed to represent the nature of the skies. Another version of the skies were used for less religious purposes such as astronomy where the historical stars were used to measure the position of the earth and its movement. For instance, navigation; or the mariners looking to the skies for celestial navigation. Celestial navigation was not only used for humans but also animals as migratory birdflyers and animals that would face particular atmospheres and conditions as they set out into the world.
Building in the Skies
Religious activity was usually focused on the highest part of the world; the heavens. People who built such structures as Churches would direct their faces towards the sky and often even build the structure to have a higher level. When it was not possible to build at height, chapels and domes were the chosen building. In many times, the sky would be used for ceremonial events such as creation legends, heavens and the underworld, afterlife and also even in human relation. Religions often directed people to the skies and often alluded to meeting others in the sky. Skywalking was also acknowledged in much religious activity.
The sun
The sun was the primary focal point for religion. The sun was associated with solar deities and would have often been used as the primary god. For instance, the sun would have been associated with many Christian origins and was described as being in the form of a man. The reason the sun is so popular as a religious figure is because of its power and it has been associated for centuries with the sky. The sky would be most often described to be warmer and hotter than on earth. Many sun images have been observed and are known to have a connection to religion.

""We approach mapping differently.""
Imagine a 3D representation of a building, expanding with detail. You can go in and out of rooms and into different levels of floors. Now, imagine the building as a forest. As you zoom out, the forest starts to look like a city on a planet. Then the planet fades and the knowledge you have on the underlying structure - the building - fades, too. This is the idea of Trilaterated Maps.
The term refers to a terrain-based approach which combines layers and layers of data, resulting in a ""totality"" of environmental knowledge. In this context, the environment is of knowledge, and is made of layers of data that filter themselves through your eyes, your brain, and your ability to process information.
There are many examples of this technique in the modern world.
Cut the trees in a forest. The structure of the forest becomes flat, creating a 2D representation of the environment. This is what we have for our buildings, cities and nav maps. This is what GPS uses to create a map.
Trawl the inner surfaces of a hill - the slope - to infer the exact shape and geometry of it. Then skim across the surface of the hill and see the contour and find the shape of the landscape above and beyond it. In the same way, different mediums of visualizations can be used to extract different information, to let you grasp the environment in an efficient and faster way.
When you are looking at a building, you see the surfaces of walls, the curvature of floors, the shape of the doors and windows, and the volume of space on your side. The environment has different layers to it, which have different information.
There is no reason why these different layers cannot also be transferred into different mediums of visualization. Technology exists - that includes tools and models, hardware and software, procedures and processes - to deliver and present data and information from different mediums of visualization.
There is no right or wrong medium to represent something. When using one medium, for example physical maps, there are features that make sense to appear on a different medium, for example a digital map.
Human beings are only able to consume information from a single layer. This is why you might ""zoom out"" - because you are trying to get away from a very complicated system to which you have difficulty relating and grasping. To understand, you may also look at another layer, such as the shape of the building, to understand how the overall system fits together.",510,4,2504

A fashion statement is more than a statement to how you dress, but it's also how it portrays your personality. Clothing choices you make are significant in terms of what other people think of you and your sense of style. Sometimes, fashion is about the feeling of your clothes and how comfortable you are in them, but sometimes it's about how people look at you. In both aspects, fashion choices are made by themselves or are influenced by other people. In this post, I'll discuss what fashion really means and how it impacts people.
What Is Fashion
Fashion is defined as the clothing choices you make based on your personality. The clothing you wear is an extension of yourself and reflects who you are. Fashion is often used in the context of 'wearables,' but it also covers any item of clothing that is of interest to the public, for example, jewelry and hair extensions.
Fashion includes not only attire but also accessories, such as bags, shoes, jewelry, and watches. The choices you make can be influenced by others, and the choices that you make can be a way of saying something about yourself. The purpose of fashion is to make you feel good and look good.
How Can Fashion Influence Your Style
Clothing choices you make can be influenced by other people. You can choose to wear something that is popular or something that is not popular, and you can choose to wear it because of its design or because of its versatility. It's important to remember that fashion is personal and that your fashion choices should be personal as well.
Fashion is also about how people look at you. In some cultures, what you wear is more important than how you look, but in other cultures, clothes and accessories are just as important as what's on the inside. The importance of fashion in today's culture is that we have access to fashion bloggers who share what they wear and their style preferences, so people can choose their clothes based on those recommendations.
How does fashion affect your style?
Fashion is the new black. It's a way of life. You can dress however you want. It's important to be comfortable in your clothes and have them fit you well, but fashion can also be fun. You can wear whatever you want to look stylish.
Fashion is a way of life and what people wear is what you wear. It also shows you what people think of you and how you want them to think of you. Clothes are a way of being sociable and making friends, and having an impact on",523,4,2518

Common misconceptions about photography that beginners should know! Many people get caught up on not understanding the different terminology of photography which many can refer to as a common misconception. Choosing the right terminology could mean all the difference in the world. Therefore it is important to get to know it when you are trying to make the great shot. In this article we want to list down some of the common misconceptions about photography that beginners should know!
When you have a colorful background and you have the subject standing in front of it it is better to have the subject looking into the foreground. On the other hand, when you have a clear and white backdrop you want to make the subject look towards the camera. Both photography styles are true and there are no rules that say either is good or bad. Just try experimenting with each and see which one makes your pictures stand out.
Many people are put off by taking the blurry pictures with a moving object. However, it is part of what photography is all about and also what makes a creative and fun pictures. The moving objects in the background, buildings, cars, people in motion, can give life to the scene.
While you are shooting you should be thinking about the whole frame. Do you want the entire animal in the picture? Or do you want just a part of it? This is something that is very important to consider, and once you have defined which direction you would like to take it the rest becomes a lot easier.
There are really no rules that say the foreground or the background is better than the other. Neither is the foreground or the background. So don't be afraid to play around with everything to get the perfect shot.
Do not be afraid to take a photo of everything. It is always fun to explore the surroundings and see what you can find. You never know when you will end up taking an amazing shot.

Scientists have found that the nerves in the brain are endless. You may have heard that the animal brain is the one that produces the brain. But in reality, the human brain is surrounded by blood vessels as well. The area occupied by the brain in the human body is relatively large compared to most body parts. The hard drive occupies more space in the human body than the brain. The number of neurons in the human brain is about 100 billion. This number is the same as the amount of dirt in the world. The fact is that the anatomical structure of the human brain resembles the structure of the outside world. This is due to the fact that people make predictions about the external world in a different way. One of the interesting facts is that there is no nerve that cannot be decomposed into chemical reactions. The reactions are ongoing in the brain and nerves. In addition, the human brain is the largest organ in the body. It is only a mosquito that has a larger brain than human beings.
An interesting fact is that you can't say that humans have advanced more than other animals because the eyes of primates and humans are similar. It is very difficult for the organism to see a simple photograph and describe that organism in real life. With the discovery of a new genetic mutation in mice, scientists confirmed that people are the only ones who can express the findings. Scientists are trying to make people like mice, and so far they have failed in this endeavor. Scientists have discovered that seven is the number of the brain that children experience on the fourth day after the birth. It is also important to note that children who see their first birthday will always remember the first day. It is more common for people who work in higher education to have a good memory. In addition, older people have a better memory than the number of people working in secondary education. It is very difficult to predict the exact time and location of an earthquake.

This article, for instance, just popped up at the top of my feed. The thought behind this section on machine learning is that if I want to buy a refrigerator, I can search ""refrigerator"" on Google and find listings for different refrigerators. Using machine learning, Google would then work to determine what I actually want rather than just tell me about each refrigerator it can find.
Picking the one that most closely matches my needs based on my search history would produce more useful results.
The technology of machine learning has long been an insular world and only available to data science experts. Today though, major companies, from Facebook to Microsoft to Amazon and Google, are embedding machine learning into their products. Meanwhile, many tech giants are investing in startups specializing in machine learning, while some, like Google and Microsoft, are making their machine learning technology available to developers through machine learning APIs.
Training a machine learning model is like training a dog. You have a ""teacher,"" a machine that inputs data and adjusts itself to fit that data. To train a model, you first give it a bunch of examples and then a dataset. The teacher's job is to find patterns in data and produce the most accurate predictions, which is what you want to get out of the machine learning model.
To train a neural network, you pass input data to the machine and adjust its parameters to produce the desired output. It can then reproduce the same results. ""If you give it more input data and additional examples, it should be able to accurately reproduce those results as well. Training a model is about calibrating the relationship between the data and its parameters in a manner that is empirically accurate for the task at hand,"" says Meredith Perry, Chief Executive Officer, Glider Labs.

Whether you are creating a blog or even a full scale website, you will need to pick a domain name. What is a domain name you may ask? It is the part before the .com, .org, .net, etc. It's the name of the website or the name of the page. Let me give you an example:
Having the domain name http://www.sycamoretrees.com/domains/ basically means that it will take the user to the website http://www.sycamoretrees.com/index.php?portal=school It's easy to get confused when dealing with subdomains but it's essential to know what it's for.
So how do I register one? This is a simple step, all you have to do is go to the domain registrar of your choice. I personally have used Network Solutions, GoDaddy and OpenSRS in the past and found that they are excellent at helping you register a domain name.
For starters, the general rule is that the domain name itself has to be unique. Remember that it is also tied to your email address. For instance if you created the domain name http://joesdomain.com then when you create your email, it will be joe@joesdomain.com.
It is also key to remember that your domain name doesn't necessarily have to be a full sentence. For instance the domain name www.facebook.com will take you to Facebook. If you have a number or special character in your domain name it can cause problems with search engines. For instance the domain name ""helloworld? if using a PC will lead to ""helloworld?"" and can't be read easily as it would normally.
When it comes to choosing a domain name, a big thing to remember is that you should pick something that you will be comfortable with over the next few years. Search engine friendliness, ease of use and personal preference are the key factors that go into picking a domain name. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask me.",429,4,1795

Technology has been a part of human history for centuries, with the first known technological advancements dating back to the Stone Age, when humans learned to use fire and tools to aid in survival. However, the modern era of technology began with the industrial revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when machines replaced manual labor and factories replaced individual cottage industries.

As technology continued to advance, it also began to have a significant impact on society. The industrial revolution led to increased productivity and a greater standard of living for many people. However, it also brought about social and economic inequality, as workers toiled in factories for long hours without the rights or protections that we take for granted today.

In the 20th century, technology continued to change the world, with the advent of mass communication, transportation, and the internet. These advancements made it easier for people to connect and share ideas, leading to a greater sense of global community and cultural exchange.

However, technology has also brought about significant challenges, such as the loss of jobs due to automation and the widespread use of artificial intelligence. It has also raised concerns about privacy and security, as personal information is increasingly being collected and stored by technology companies.

Overall, the history of technology has been one of progress and innovation, but also one of challenges and controversies. As technology continues to evolve, it will be important to weigh the benefits and risks and work to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner.

I don't think technology is always beneficial for society. In fact, I think it has made things worse. Take social media, for example. People are becoming addicted to it and it's ruining their relationships with others. What do you think?
I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. however, it is true that social media can have negative effects on society, such as the addiction to it and the negative impact it can have on relationships. however, it is also important to acknowledge that social media can have positive effects, such as increasing social connections, facilitating communication, and providing access to information. it is up to individuals and society to use technology in a responsible and balanced manner, recognizing its potential benefits and drawbacks. it is essential to set healthy boundaries and manage technology use to avoid negative impacts on mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.

I still think technology has made things worse for society. It's all about profit, and companies only care about making money. They don't care about the negative effects it has on us.",511,4,2793

* The constant motion is great exercise for your hands, arms and shoulders.

**It gives you a sense of accomplishment.** This is very obvious in the case of taking an amazing picture. But that’s not all there is to photography.

**It’s a way of showing people what you’ve seen.** This is important for all creative types. It’s great to see your work displayed in a professional gallery, but it is infinitely more meaningful when you can display it on your own website. You have a real tangible document of what you’ve seen in your life, and it shows other people what you love, your travels, your home, etc.

This is a very deep meditation. If you really want to look inside your mind, then this meditation is for you. The idea behind this type of meditation is to reduce the thought that is currently circulating in your mind and to reach the mind of the subconscious. In this process, you can experience meaningful peace in the mind of the mind. All you need is to open your mind and let your subconscious mind fill your mind with the space.

As a mind-boggling 95% of all styles (including nearly all that are now extinct) remained unlisted, a new classification was needed to mark them. To this end, I have selected those Korean traditional schools of Taekwondo (JKMA) still in existence today, and in which most practitioners now engage. This list contains schools of TKD most often known in English, such as MooDukKwan, SongDuk, Chon Ji, and ChonKiShinGyo, but is not meant to be all inclusive. Not only are there other schools (such as ChongTong, ITF, and Hanbun, to name a few) as well as unlisted styles and schools, my choice of what names to include could certainly be argued. The desired purpose, however, is to recognize traditions that warrant instruction, rather than to name every extant one. Below are 17 styles that span a range of influence and antiquity, and an illustration of their varied history over the 20th and 21st centuries. The choice to show the images I have is based solely on personal preference.
During the formation of SongDuk, as established in the 1950s, this style undertook a “Tai Chi form” — ChaGeun — for use by the SongDuk authorities during testing to determine mastery of rank. It was largely abandoned in the years that followed, but remains a notable element of SongDuk’s history. The SongDuk standards (especially the lower ranks) were first adopted by ChonKiShinGyo, and it soon won a key stake in the Korean TKD market. In the early 1970s, ChonKi was reformed under the leadership of General Choi Hong Hi, and the written collection of requirements called the “Admonition” (IlmunChaTong) was written for ChonKi, and only later coopted for SongDuk. Today, SongDuk is the third most widespread style (although this is disputed) at around 20% of practitioners, and the 2010 World Championship boasted 40 teams of 116 competitors.

First the surface is noted as the boundary of the atmosphere and the ocean. You’ll find the wind and the air in this area with temperature changes and the water itself. Under the surface, there is the sediment and the material that it holds. Lastly, the ocean depths are often more hot, corrosive, and difficult to access and therefore, not very studied.
So where do we start? Some of us are very interested in the deep ocean where all the tropical fish live. And others want to learn more about the shelf, the coral reefs, the Juan de Fuca Strait, the Juan de Fuca Plate, or one of the many types of currents.
Instead of taking a bath in the ocean, we would make use of the scientific inventions such as underwater trunks, submarines, submarines with detection devices, and other equipment. Additionally, you may see humans examining the side of underwater mountains and beneath the ocean’s surface there are known as seamounts, or ridges of mountains that are known to reach up to the ocean’s surface. You can also find very deep and very hot valleys like the Kermadec Trench in the South Pacific that has been of interest to many geologists.
Here you will learn all about Oceanology.
From Icebergs to ocean currents, learn about the seven ocean depths and the life that live in the ocean. What about what lives in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef, the Gobi Sea, or the mouth of the Colorado River? You may know the life on the ocean’s surface, however, there is also a great amount of life that lives deeper than the eye can see. What about the people who die in or on the ocean, how do they get stored and what if there are not many bodies? How do the currents of the ocean affect the world at all? These and a few more questions, will be addressed in our area called the oceanic tide.
Consider how hard it is to swim against a current. That is how the ocean or tides, works. You will learn everything about oceanic currents, currents within lakes, and how we have explored the ocean depths to learn about the oceanic tide.

940,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", it is said, is a habit of mind. It is a matter of seeing things not only from one’s own point of view but, more or less, without a point of view.
This rather metaphorical formulation is itself ambiguous. How is a mind to be seen? At the very least it must be seen in action. It must be observed in thought processes, verbal habits, affective orientation, and decision making, as well as in verbal products. We should not, however, proceed to ask how these, and other processes might go on “without” points of view. Nor need we invoke the language of divination in order to speak about seeing thoughts without one’s point of view. One can see thoughts as separate phenomena. The mind can, as with art, achieve self-awareness: in other words, it can see itself without a point of view.
In general, what we mean by seeing the environment as it is, apart from the personal or prepersonal wants and projects of a given individual, is seeing thoughts, actions, and objects as thoughts and actions and objects. Things are not seen or described as projecting something out into one, the individual, but are rather seen in their single positions in a cosmological order where various kinds of relations are defined and many that remain undefined. We may say that seeing the environment as it is entails seeing it as ordered and hierarchic; there is one thing that is other to things, that divides things; there is an external world, subject to the laws that make things by themselves thinkable and describable. Above all, there is a given public world external to the given private world of the individual. Individuals are not master of their own domain; they are subject to various kinds of constraint. Between such constraints and any arrangements or orders can come the question of order and the order of nature. Between the law that of a given social order can come the question of order and the order of nature.
Nature, as opposed to man-made constructions, is supposed to be something that lies beyond the contingencies of history and of present human interest. Thus the nature that is seen as one thing divides men into parties or classes. Yet, as the ethnologist, Raymond Bar bas points out, “in the last resort, the primitives [in North America] are still disturbed by the relative powers of various spirituous foods, of ceremonies of different types, or of different family or clan groups.” The use of a given form of analysis is “more or less arbitrary”: the ethnologist may use",531,4,2482

Chris had always been an active person, but as he got older, he found it harder to keep up with his younger self. One day, he decided it was time to make a change. Chris began working out regularly, and he saw immediate benefits.

Not only did he feel stronger and healthier, but his confidence soared. He had always been intimidated by his brother-in-law, who was a professional athlete. But after just a few weeks of training, Chris felt like he could stand up to anyone.

But it wasn't just his physical fitness that improved. Chris also noticed a positive impact on his mental health. He found that working out helped him relax and clear his mind. He no longer felt as stressed or anxious as he used to.

As Chris continued to push himself in the gym, he started to notice even more benefits. He had more energy throughout the day, and he was able to tackle tasks with ease. He was more productive at work, and he was able to make time for the things he loved, like hiking and reading.

Best of all, Chris was able to set a great example for his family. His wife and kids joined him at the gym, and they all saw the benefits of fitness together. They were able to make healthier choices in their daily lives, like cooking at home and drinking more water.

In the end, Chris realized that fitness wasn't just about looking good or being strong. It was about feeling good, being healthy, and living a fulfilling life. And he was grateful to have discovered that for himself.

What exactly is psychology? It’s a vast, multidisciplinary field that studies human behavior and thoughts. Professionals can focus their studies on a wide range of disciplines, such as developmental and social psychology, abnormal psychology, psychological statistics, and research methodologies. Psychology graduates can study everything from how advertising affects consumer behavior to how people recover from a traumatic event. They can also help people with clinical disorders.
There are many different types of psychologists, and it’s important to understand what they do. Some have a dual focus on psychological and behavioral research. Behaviorism was one of the most dominant psychological theories of the 20th century and emphasized the importance of environmental influences and learning. Behaviorists believed that psychologists should work with children to help them learn positive behavior. Psychologists are responsible for shaping and overseeing the improvement of behavior. Here are a few examples of psychology.

The study of human behavior and thoughts is the basis of psychology. Psychologists study the basic elements of the human mind, including perception and thinking. They also study the human mind’s structure and function. Understanding a person’s psychological needs and desires can be essential to their success as a professional and a person. There are many different fields of psychology, including neuroscience, child psychology, and cognitive psychology. There are countless career opportunities in psychology, and these professionals are not limited to one area.
There are different branches of psychology. One of the most common is clinical psychology, which deals with the mental health of people. Another branch is behavioral therapy, which aims to improve mental health in patients. A third branch is social psychology, which studies how groups affect the behavior of individuals. Finally, cognitive psychology studies the mental processes that affect a person’s behavior. As a result, psychology can have a wide range of applications.
A psychologist’s job can be very demanding. A psychologist needs to meet the requirements of other professionals, such as a psychiatrist, in order to provide a comprehensive treatment plan. In addition to this, he or she must adhere to strict confidentiality policies. This can create potential conflicts of interest. For these reasons, psychologists must develop good problem-solving and communication skills to get the best possible outcome for their patients.
General knowledge of psychology is helpful in understanding behavior and thoughts of humans. It is also an important tool in policy-making.

Shifting from college classrooms to college towns
Studying sociology means that you don’t have to be really smart, or willing to spend countless hours reading and learning through a textbook; in fact, sociology is one of the easier majors to get the best grades in.
“But when you get to college, don’t you just stop paying attention, because you have so many other classes to worry about and really need to focus on that?” senior art student Kyrie Spicer asked.
Not necessarily, Spicer clarified. “What else you have to worry about is Sociology, because that takes over all the time,” she said.
The answer to her question may vary, but many students discover that sociology is a fun and easy major to earn a good grade in.
On average, there are 19 students in a class that takes Intro to Sociology from Dr. Bianca White, a psychology professor at Maryville College. White teaches five classes with more than 400 students.
“Two of the classes I’ve taught have around 100 students each, so I’ll get one or two messages from each of those classes asking me a question, but for the most part, this class doesn’t get a lot of questions, because there are so many other things to look at,” White said.
Most classes require students to attend each day, get a textbook, and take notes. Sociology is different. Most of the time, the notes and the study material are in a PowerPoint.
One of the major differences about taking a sociology class is how students are graded. Not only does White incorporate a mandatory test and final exam, but she also has an opinion component to her grade. While the paper doesn’t count for much, the opinions, quizzes, and exams add up.
“I don’t want to use big words in my opinion paper, because I don’t want to have too many things wrong on it, but I know that I’m going to have to come up with a good conclusion,” senior Nick Whitley said. “I’m more worried about seeing a lowered letter grade on my test than anything, because you can tell me what I need to know on that test, but the history of the test is too complicated.”
Apart from the opinion paper, students will need to write a summary of material from a textbook, and another essay or a presentation that will showcase their ability to gather information from their fellow classmates. Not only do the students have to memorize information, but they also have to apply it.

950,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and psychiatry needs to take patient cooperation seriously. Psychosocial interventions are the cornerstone of psychiatry. And much of their efficacy comes from patient cooperation. For this to happen, the context of the interplay between doctor and patient needs to be understood and employed in a way which is not ad-hoc but is systematic. This is a point at which anti-psychiatry arguments have their most serious ground. The existing conceptual framework of the doctor patient relationship must change.
This seems to be, I think, an example of a situation where even if you get the mechanism right, you still have a problem.
Going back to the critique of positivist medicine, it is perfectly true that, with medicine as with anything else, if one fixes the mechanism wrongly then one’s policy prescriptions based on that will be wrong, and may in fact be anti-therapeutic, anti-disease, anti-life.
But this is a point at which one can ask ‘OK, what would go wrong if we made the suggestion above – so named anti-therapeutic, anti-disease, anti-life, anti-psychiatry – that the ‘conventional’ model of doctor-patient relationships is wrong, or not a sufficient basis for the sociology of psychiatry? How could that be wrong?’
Well, you see this in the late Kevin McGorrian’s trenchant comments about medical training, that it’s by necessity very ‘mechanistic’ and ignores ‘the real work’. And this is what you see about as well.
I’ve been noting some parallel points in the sociology of mental health and family interventions recently, where many problems such as ‘service resistance’ come from the failure of such systems to realise the importance of the ‘real work’ and whether it is appropriate, or whether we really need it, or whether we need to be aware of how externalising this so that the patient and family can recognise it as their own.
Similarly for psychiatry, it seems to me that both the problem of gettings too much treatment – often ‘therapeutic’ is not quite the right word, but I’m not sure what it is – and gettings not enough, and not having a good sense of whether the ‘syndrome’ has in fact been changed into a ‘trouble’ and whether this might require the patient and family to do something about it. Where, of course, the doctors’ ‘bag of tricks’ is much greater than the patient or family’s.

In a world where technology has increased our ability to live sedentary lives and has slowly replaced the physical activity which used to shape our bodies and our minds, dancers are on the frontline of a global war for the health and happiness of the masses.
For centuries dance was a key element of celebrations across the world. It connected us all, celebrating the diversity of the world and uniting us under a single banner. We’ve gone far from this attitude today. Often, dance has been banned, which only served to stifle the creativity of our civilisations and many of our finest dances have been lost with each new generation.
Thankfully, we’re now in a golden era of dance, where we can enjoy one of the purest, most honest art forms the world has ever known, with the mindset that we are merely tapping into a universal connection with one another. Modern technology is the bane of many things these days, but in this instance, we should be very thankful for its invention.
We are rarely told why dance is such an important component of life. The sciences of human psychology and the management of the human mind and body have been revolutionary in the past, helping to develop treatments for mental illness, physical illness, or in improving our quality of life in any of the 64 ‘states of consciousness’. Dance is no different, and it has been celebrated in all manner of treatment programs around the world.
Dancing is a huge part of rehab. Early recovery can take a long time, which can be frustrating and for those with addictive tendencies it can be their undoing. One element of this problem can come from withdrawal, which is sometimes fatal to alcoholics, as withdrawal can cause agitation, depression, and serious psychosis. Dance therapy is already used to help with these issues, and can prove hugely effective at getting people back on their feet. You can view some pictures of recovery by clicking here.
The problem of isolation isn’t new, but in modern times, it has become more dangerous than ever. We don’t know our neighbors like we once did, and even if we wanted to, we are too busy with our busy lives. Dancers not only learn to move with others, but also learn to understand the value of the human touch. Being surrounded by too many people can cause stress, but too much isolation can cause anxiety and depression.

Focus is on transferring the latest innovations in psychological theories, research and techniques, and translating them into artistic form. Descriptions are often given in detail about both the processes and what results are produced. This is perhaps much-needed in the current climate of therapy, and yet, if we look at the history of art therapy, such a change is neither new nor recent. In fact, basic and core art therapy principles and modalities often viewed as traditional and fundamental have been around for centuries. Interestingly, there has been a resurgence in interest of some of these. Let's explore how we can tap into our tradition for inspiration and expertise by revisiting some of the fundamental art therapy principles that have been long in existence.
The philosophy of art therapy is closely connected to important philosophic theories. Art has been used as a method of therapy since the Greek periods. Originally, art was one of the only accessible methods of expressing one's emotions and feelings as technology was limited. However, technology has now evolved to make art therapy more accessible than ever. From working with clay, to musical instruments, and even video projections, various mediums are implemented to guide the patient into the therapeutic process. Choosing a medium for our sessions gives us a great opportunity to explore some of the core art therapy principles.
One of the most important aspects of art therapy is our ability to reflect on our inner world and then share this reflection with the client. In this process, a person's inner world is amplified to represent a deeper way of seeing one's mind and body. As we create our art, we internalize the information and bring it out. This process is essential for increased self-awareness and often results in the patient embracing a deeper understanding of their inner nature.
This introduction of inner reflection allows for the creation of an open space for discussion. Art therapy welcomes therapeutic discussions and encourages transparency. Transparency is a crucial component of the therapeutic process as it opens up to an in-depth exploration of the patient's inner work. In art therapy sessions, we embrace the client's emotional journey to a deeper level and allow for a process of the self to open up on a more personal level. Art helps us reveal aspects of ourselves that are difficult to express otherwise, both through expressions on paper and the perceptions and feelings of others.
Creativity in its purest form is often conceived as the primary goal of art therapy as it provides the person with an opportunity to use their senses to express themselves. Art encompasses visual, auditory",525,4,2813

Whilst I'm not a professional photographer, I do own and occasionally use a small digital camera and feel that the ethics of photography are of great importance in my hobby. So I was looking forward to reading this book with great interest. It might seem somewhat surprising to see such a non-professional writer have such a strong interest and knowledge on the subject, but this shows one of the book's biggest weaknesses; by never being a professional photographer, Steller limits his own opinions, experience and knowledge. He manages to somehow sound objective but never impartial. It's the kind of subject that requires extensive first-hand experience and a very well-rounded and moderate view of the ethics of photography in general. Steller does not always come across in this way. Steller is, of course, permitted to speak from his own experiences, but it's interesting that, throughout the whole book, Steller consistently chooses to stay with only anecdotal evidence.
The book is made up of 9 main chapters, each one of which Steller (usually) comes up with three different ethical questions regarding that chapter. An example of this is in Chapter 1 - Identity. Steller describes his first camera as an automatic Kodak Instamatic, probably getting his first walk-around camera, the Ricoh XR-2000 about the time he entered college. He acknowledges, and points to some others, the ethical implications of media ownership and creation, such as if you believe corporations own the cameras rather than you as the creator. He then goes on to muse about his identiy and connection to, for example, the image he takes of a person's mother whilst he's visiting a funeral home in Chapter 11, Funeral, which really isn't that relevant to any of the ethical questions Steller poses.
While we do get the insight into Steller's life, from learning about his experience as a lone amateur photographer to discovering film photography - quite a dramatic shift in terms of using technology - we really didn't get much insight into the ""ethics"" in the book's title. Steller doesn't do a very good job of talking about ethics in photography. The book ends up coming across as something that should have been titled ""The Long Way Home.""",527,4,2521

The efficacy of robots is usually perceived in their ""cloning"" potential. Once they are programmed to perform one task, they can repeat that task to any extent.

Automated sensors could send data in formats and structures that human annotators would have difficulty in representing; but robots are robots and will able to comprehend any such data with no or very few adaptations, thus providing additional benefits of scalability and reducing costs. 

Processing sensor data can be time-consuming (i.e. convert a time-stamped video into a text file with a timestamp for each frame) and is required in many different applications including video surveillance, motion detection, traffic analysis etc. But some aspects of processing sensor data can easily be handled by a computer without an explicit human intervention (as in the example mentioned above). 

The following are two examples that could benefit from the use of robotic assistance in the annotation process. 

* Cleaning the parking lots of office buildings. Some data that we expect to get from this activity would be:

* number of cars parked at a certain time
* the time series of these numbers
* percentage of customer satisfaction.

But there are two problems with this data (as the *aforementioned* example and that is the efficiency and the safety. Humans would have no problem to work in these conditions, but we can't expect to do similar jobs for long (one hour would be good). Nonetheless, we would like to get this data. 

* Video footage from camcorders of live sports events is available to everyone nowadays. The rest of the organizers and enthusiasts should not miss out on this huge profit opportunity. But how do we decide which events (together with their times and names) will be shown on live TV? Even if this set of data has a well-defined business logic, different people may have different interpretations and deliver substandard results.

Here is the point: if we can get the needed data from robots, we can do more with it. We don't have to worry about how many people we have to hire at 2am to do that. And what if all these jobs (mentioned in the examples) will become repetitive in the future?

The ability to distinguish different colors is one of the defining human traits. We have very little pigment in our skin and hair, yet we can discern tens of thousands of colors. A property of our eyes that plays an important role in this ability to distinguish color is the receptor in the retina that detects color. It is simply the way we look at the world!
Humans usually have three types of color receptors in our retina — type 1 receptors respond to yellow light, type 2 receptors respond to green light, and type 3 receptors respond to red light (these numbers refer to the receptors' spectral response. See how the eye detects colors to find out more about the receptor classes). Since the spectra of sunlight and laser light are well understood, it is possible to measure the relative amounts of each color in the world.
Three different receptors with three different spectral sensitivities: red, green and blue, are involved in color vision (Image by Jon McLoone)
Each receptor is tuned to a certain portion of the spectrum. For instance, type 1 receptors are most sensitive to yellow light in the range of 570-585 nm. We can make a spectrum from these responses to get the sensitivity curve for type 1 receptors. The type 3 receptors are most sensitive to red light between 615-625 nm. A type 2 receptor spectrum is between 445-475 nm, which is between the green and blue wavelengths. Not surprisingly, the type 1 and type 2 receptors are tuned to a spectrum with three peaks. Below is a picture of the sensitivity curves of the three receptors (image from here)
When light with these wavelengths reach the eye, the type 1 receptors receive more light, while the type 2 and 3 receptors receive approximately the same amount of light. The activity of each type of receptor is different at various wavelengths, because their sensitivity curves are different. This is demonstrated in the figure below.
The activation of retinal cells, showing how the type 1 and 2 cells respond to light over a range of wavelengths. The green curves represent the response of the type 2 cells and the red curves represent the response of the type 1 cells (Image from here)

Cryptography is the art of hiding messages and communication. It is one of the oldest and most indispensable technologies of the internet. There have been numerous algorithms and protocols devised to make it the most secure and valuable resource. Let's take a look at a few facts about cryptography.
Almost every person uses cryptography in some way or another. For instance, the basic watermarks which are found in small print on a document are a form of cryptography. When one prints the document the idea is to ensure that the copy does not contain watermarks, so the document would most probably be sent as a picture to be saved.
As technology is continuously upgraded, so are the encryption systems. There are several encrypted systems used by governments and organizations. Algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard, known as AES, have 128-bit block and 128, 192 or 256 bit keys.
Cryptography is said to be more of a mathematical knowledge. That is because the principle of cryptography are based on mathematics, so one's basic understanding of numbers is the foundation for cryptography.
Today, most businesses have strict policies regarding passwords. However, we are still no strangers to easily forgettable passwords, which are standard combinations of one's date of birth, name or something otherwise unremarkable. However, if one uses cryptography then their passwords would be 16 random letters or so.
People all over the world are using cryptography in several ways. Schools, hospitals, hospitals, government agencies, corporations, businesses and individuals use cryptography every day for both private and public communications. Cryptography is essential to both life and survival in the modern world.
If you want to learn cryptography, you can do so by being a part of this online tool training. As there are several online tools available, you can also make use of them to enhance your knowledge about cryptography.",384,4,1938

966,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,". In a nutshell, a component is said to be linear if the ratio of an input and an output gives the same output as an output and an input. To be linear means that the output is equal to the input multiplied by some constant. A transformer works this way, it requires an input current, applies a voltage to it to induce some output current. The input current to the transformer is not added to the output current, it is multiplied by some unknown value, this is what a transformer is, it converts one type of current into another. A simple system might use many stages of a transformer to get higher output voltages from the same sized system. This happens because a transformer works by summing the output voltages from each of the transformer stages. A capacitor is not a linear component, it does not work this way. For one, capacitors do not have a purely linear input voltage (or current) as they are not linear components. But also, capacitors do not even have pure linear output. With the exception of a long straight wire, a capacitor does not provide a voltage that is proportional to the input current. A capacitor is only approximately linear. At lower frequencies, it is fairly linear. But at high frequencies, it does become nonlinear. In this, the input current is not applied to the output voltage, it is used as a means to determine the amount of stored charge. The voltage is determined by how much charge is in the capacitor, the capacity of the capacitor. Capacitors are therefore generally non-linear. Some components exhibit their nonlinear effects on only part of their spectrum. Op-amps, for example, are not linear on any portion of their spectrum. They do however tend to be somewhat linear in their middle section of the spectrum. In these areas, there are no limits on the input or output voltages. Outside of these areas, a distortion is introduced into the signal as nonlinear effects are then experienced. Lumped Element Circuit The concept of a lumped element circuit is somewhat different from an electro-mechanical circuit. In an electro-mechanical circuit, the physical reality of the components within the system are taken into account. This gives the designer the understanding of what changes in one part of the system will effect what else in the system. It can even be used to determine the physical reality of the behavior of that portion of the system. For example, if a potentiometer were to be placed in the current path of a resistor and the electric current changed, the physical state of the potentiometer could",533,4,2555
967,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is an unlikely one. New technology trends include aspects that could impact the gardening industry. Although new technology can offer many benefits to the modern-day gardener, the technology can also go bad. Consumers should be aware of the impacts that technology can have in this industry. Many consumers will be looking for the latest and greatest new technology because of its fancy appearance.
On the other hand, technology may not always be the best decision for gardening. For instance, newer technology has created plants that are less resilient and weaker than older plants. Non-natural progressions in technology have also limited the methods in which homeowners can garden. The world has progressed so rapidly that we forget how many of the backyard tools that we currently have once existed. Innovations in technology will always play a role in the industry, but the decision to continue to invest in new technology should always be a thought-out one. There are so many high-tech pieces of equipment on the market that require a hefty investment. Although a high-tech piece of equipment may be marketed as something that will help you garden, it may actually cause you more harm than good. For example, if you use a tool that has blades attached to it, this tool may be the cause of a minor or even major injury. Although there are plenty of positives to using technology, not all of them will work for everyone.
Technology has brought gardeners more efficient options than ever before. From home automation apps to dual-input sprinkler systems to self-watering pots, there are many gardening solutions that can help with the daily maintenance of a garden. GPS “Ornamental Gardening Aid” Apps can help more than just the average person. Expert gardeners can also make use of apps that have many benefits and uses.

This could lead to a homeowner deciding not to purchase a lawn mower due to the increase in body weight and energy cost. Of course, the mowing itself should be delegated to the kids.

968,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," sustainability is actually quite simple. Simply put, the environment has to thrive. For us to continue as a civilization, the environment has to be healthy and functioning in a fashion similar to how we’ve known it to be. As with all things in life, it’s actually quite complicated in practice. But when you boil down the endless interrelated factors that make up the environment and its changes, you’ll see that the core values are pretty simple: maintaining, caring, and rejuvenating.
So, with that in mind, what can we do as individuals to make sure that we can live in a sustainable environment? And also, can we extend that to helping the environment flourish? The answer is yes – and the further reading below will provide us with some insight into how we can do just that.
Something that can often be overlooked, in the grand scheme of things, is recycling and reusing things that we use in the house. This encompasses everything from water bottles to milk jugs to the paper products you use regularly and other compostable materials. Keep in mind that the compostable materials are crucial to growing more of the sustainable plants we rely on; these include certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts (among other things).
This is also one of the places in which we often overspend. After all, when we aren’t making any efforts to repair household items, we are having to replace them on a regular basis. Whether it’s a computer or a bread mixer, these types of purchases can quickly add up. Keeping household items in working condition is really important, as well, because it decreases the number of products we throw away.
Another key to a sustainable household is minimizing energy usage. You can do this by turning off lights and appliances when you aren’t using them. Another good idea is to install your appliances on timers, so that they automatically shut off when you aren’t using them. Make sure to turn off your air conditioning when you aren’t home. And be sure to always use green power when you can.
Food production is one of the largest contributors to environmental damage. Keep this in mind while grocery shopping by purchasing things that are eco-friendly and organic, and try to avoid meats altogether. Meat has been proven to be one of the largest contributors to global warming and to water pollution, in addition to health issues and large environmental impacts.",490,4,2388

This should give more hope to the development of machines that are actually able to see the world, by modeling the “program of our retina”. This is a major milestone in artificial intelligence research.
The goal is for machines to be able to see colors, the method used was inspired by the workings of the retina. 150,000 neurons are responsible for allowing the human eye to detect colors. “Deep-learning is one approach to achieve this: by training artificial neurons on a large corpus of images, we learn to identify objects,” explains Pascal Gorgui, a master’s student in computer science at the University of Oxford, on his blog.
With the technique called Random Forest, the researchers can identify the main areas of interest of each photo by giving it a color. This method also has the advantage of being quite fast. For each new picture, the computer only has to recognize the object once, before assigning a color to it. Thus, in six milliseconds, a billion colors are displayed on a computer screen. The researchers are thinking of improving this algorithm to recognize different shades of color.
This project was conducted with the Technion institute of Israel as well as members of the BrainHex lab in Oxford, Prof. Takuro Matsuzaki, and the Japanese and German cooperative laboratories.

Artificial neurons have existed since the mid-nineties, but researchers were unable to teach them how to interpret images until recently.

For 20 years, we’ve heard about professors at some prestigious medical schools cheating on patients’ exams. Now we’re finding out it’s not just students. It’s the faculty.
A disastrous set of mistakes and failures at George Washington University (GW) resulted in the death of a patient who started breathing the wrong way. This and other stories of medical cheating involve cases that seem either unimaginably stupid or would seem to be beyond imagination. A Faculty Senate investigation found that in most cases of cheating, this was a calculated risk taken by faculty, not junior students. From our comments on an investigation into academic cheating at Harvard:?
We have new details in another scandal at George Washington, where 29 students were suspended or expelled for a student-submitted quiz on June 5. That would normally be the big cheating scandal of the month, but another scandal has now eclipsed it: A faculty subclient. Accusations that faculty’s own subs and siblings were being covered up by administrators, that legitimate patient complaints were ignored, and most damning, that some faculty were caught on camera coaching and helping patients pass a lab exam. Yes, a college health center exam in which students are handed a patient and a virtual patient-teacher.
A background set of competing scandals at Boston Children’s Hospital and pediatric orthopedics: Cheating students, or is it children? Harvard cheating on a residents’ quiz, where researchers say the free and fair distribution of exam questions is far more important than catching grad students cheating on questions that may be impossible to read, not easily interpreted, or not developed by them. USAPhO, The American Medical Students Association, cheats on climate change? And the recent death of a patient after cardiac arrest at George Washington, which happened less than a year after the discovery of student-actually-submitted exams and faculty-faculty-collaboration in grading (done apparently after checks and balances) and in role-playing with patients.
And that’s just the most recent in a string of situations that no one in the profession, outside maybe the pharmaceutical industry, could claim to be shocked by. And yet, that doesn’t seem to matter. We’re supposed to believe that this isn’t systematic, and that this isn’t epidemic. My experience is that there is a broad spectrum of cheating, ranging from",523,4,2602

What would happen if we could just fix the flaws in our bodies?
This is a question I have also posed in 2008 to Alyn Rockwood, director of the Centre for Applied Neuroscience at Carleton University and one of my astronomy profs. Alyn has since then taken a job in Canada at Laurentian University as an Associate Professor and Deputy Director of the Centre for Research in Applied Neuroscience (CRAN), which provides health, disability, rehabilitation and longevity research to national and international clients.
If all functions could be operated from the outside, the limitations associated with that framework could easily be removed and more effective methods to accomplish daily functions developed.
What this means for us is that we could see the need to hire body guards to look out for hazards for the body, such as chemicals or foreign objects.
Similarly, to achieve optimality, better interfaces with the body are necessary. But when applying medical interventions to the body, from heart to brain to joint, the interface may not be the simplest, but one requiring a complex signal processing and homeostasis relationship.
Certainly most of us are familiar with the idea of or applied too, any of the current medical interfaces which are applied externally to the body. These are the ones we are most familiar with but are not generally the best for achieving the desired end result.
For example, a simple heart monitor or pacemaker, fits an external framework to a target system. In this case the heart and blood vessel system, but the interfaces are not optimally designed. Heart rate, blood pressure etc. are largely determined by the responses of the heart as it works to keep the body supplied with an optimal level of circulation. But if heart rate can be determined from the surface of the body – by doing something such as placing electrodes on skin – then why not save the heart? Like gluing electrical leads on skin, why not have the heart itself “glued” onto the skin? Since the heart relies on blood vessels to keep itself within a temperature range, why not use special, heat-sealing, polymer materials to keep the heart near body temperature? Could the heart actually be sewn onto the skin to save the heart?
The same type of interface exists in knee replacement. Indeed, there are surgeons who can apply patches directly to joints to improve function. Why not",510,4,2622
972,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Science can be described in many ways, such as a knowledge base, the study of objects outside of our own bodies and analyzing how they behave, how we can replicate them, and what their interactions with us are, but it can also be described as science fiction and fantasy. Think of a physicist asking you if you have ever heard of “dark matter,” not to waste your time with an useless question, but because you (possibly) didn’t know of its existence. The fact that dark matter can’t be directly observed by scientists led them to ask whether it could exist. When confronted with this question, many were sceptical, claiming it was impossible for such a matter to exist, but if one was to investigate more closely, they may find that the question ‘can something exist?’ is much less certain than we tend to think it is.
We live in a physical world, yet an inherent part of our human nature is to question it. We can thus ask if there could be a force which could move particles towards something they are in a state of repulsion to; one which would go against the direction of nature. Looking at the world around us, we’re quite sure there is no such force in effect as gravity or the repulsive force of antimatter, but we certainly cannot dismiss the possibility that there is an unseen force which prevents the spread of dark matter and that there is no doubt that it has shaped our universe, indeed our very existence. In other words, the same force that is speeding up light speed could also pull you along with it as you’re hit with a force opposite to your natural attraction towards the earth. The premise of dark matter that scientists put forward at the beginning of the 20th century essentially posits that it exists, but not in the way people have observed it so far.
Hawking, in 1965 came up with the idea that black holes could be the cause of dark matter. We can track the path of an object in a black hole by analyzing the way it behaves. They show that every material object moves the same way within a black hole, as if it were in a straight line with a positive force pulling it inwards. This might lead one to say that black holes can explain it, as it must be true that all paths lead to a destination (which is the center of the black hole). However, there are two problems with that.
For one, the number of new black holes that could be created due to an event are over-extrapolated, and",515,4,2409

Being in this state of consciousness allows your thoughts to become silent, allowing you to unlock information that has previously been blocked from access and awareness, unknown to the physical mind.
It is believed that the experience of transcending from reality, into the state of transcendence, into the third dimension, is what brings one to the door of awakening. However, one is only able to be in this state if one learns how to cultivate a more receptive and calm mind, by learning and mastering this ability.
To take meditation to another level, one must enter the world of theta. Theta is a level of consciousness characterized by enhanced creativity, intuition, memory, compassion, imagination and mental function. It is characterized as being the state of “in between” sleep and waking, and is theorized to be the highest level of consciousness achievable by humans.
In this high state of consciousness, our body is at rest, yet our mind is awake and we can experience our truest, purest and inner most self – Theta meditation works with activating all of the senses.
At theta, our mind's abilities are one's ability to heal oneself through energy. For in this state, the intuition, imagination, and empathy of our mind, are highly developed.
Your body is naturally in a state of theta all the time. Unfortunately, we have trained our minds to keep us in beta, which is associated with anxiety, overexertion, and heightened emotions and feelings. People who train their minds to stay in beta, are the ones who normally suffer from those feelings. Though, if one takes the time to actively go into a state of theta to train your mind to shift from beta to theta, in short, theta helps one stay grounded.
This ability is what scientists call ""higher awareness"". We are here to be taught how to activate our real self in a way that is not reliant on the physical body, but to be connected through our soul, intuition, and natural inner abilities, and instincts, to learn how to be in the moment. Mindful, and present to the things that we want to do and how we want to create change in our life. Theta meditation training provides one with the correct tools",526,4,2528

In ancient times, cooking was primarily done over open fires. Early humans would roast meat and vegetables and cook them in pits. Eventually, cooking was done in large cooking pots over an open flame. 

During the Middle Ages, cooking evolved due to the rise of cities and trade. People ate more processed foods, and spices were used to enhance flavor. 

With the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, cooking methods began to change. Baking became a popular method of cooking, and refrigeration allowed for longer storage times. 

In the 20th century, home cooking changed with the introduction of electrical appliances like stoves, refrigerators, and ovens. These appliances made cooking more efficient and introduced new cooking techniques, such as microwave cooking. 

In recent decades, culinary technology has led to new cooking methods like sous vide, which uses precise temperatures to cook food. The rise of social media and food blogs has also transformed the way people cook, with a focus on more creative and visually appealing dishes. 

Overall, cooking has evolved from simple survival techniques to elaborate art forms that are both delicious and beautiful.

It's fascinating how much cooking has changed over time. Do you think there will be even more advancements in the future? As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to predict the future, but it is highly likely that there will be further advancements in the field of cooking. With the advancements of technology and the increasing availability of ingredients from different cultures, it is highly probable that new cooking methods and techniques will continue to emerge. Furthermore, the demand for convenience and time-saving techniques will also drive the development of new cooking appliances and tools that make cooking easier, quicker and more efficient.

I wonder how technology will change the way we cook in the future. Will it be more hands-off or will we still need to do a lot of work? It is likely that technology will make cooking easier and more efficient, but it is unlikely that it will completely replace the need for human labor. Cooking will likely continue to involve a combination of technology and human effort, depending on the specific cooking method and task. For example, microwave ovens will continue to be popular for quickly reheating and cooking food, while Sous Vide machines will offer precise temperature control to cook food to perfection. Additionally, new advances in virtual reality and sensory technology may also have an impact on the way we cook in the future",511,4,2733

Some writers about mathematics have argued against its use in philosophy, complaining that mathematics is ""not about the world"". Alan Sokal argues that it doesn't matter: from the standpoint of anthropology and sociology, it is not as if ""a book such as Euclid's Elements [which was written for mathematicians, not philosophers] or Pappus's Collection of Formal Theorems was a collection of texts produced by independent systems of writing by different ancient cultures or languages"" and if there is a controversy it should be resolved by translating into the language in which mathematics is actually expressed. But others have taken his critique seriously, and emphasize the strangeness of mathematics. For example, Reuben Hersh describes it as a ""kinetic system"" rather than ""static"" like physics, and an interpretative system rather than a method of exploration or explanation.[1] Some philosophers argue that while as a method of exploration mathematics appears no more robust or essential than the method of moving things about to prove objects that are of no use to us but interesting, mathematics is more intrinsic to how science works than is its methodology.

According to the philosopher Simon Blackburn, the more interesting question is not how useful mathematics is to us now, but what its implications are for our thinking in the past, present and future. Historically, according to Blackwell, advances in mathematics have been driven by the need to understand and relate to phenomena that are beyond direct experience, in particular with respect to time and the cosmos. In its applications to politics, economics, and society in general, mathematics has been appropriated as a technology that can be used to manage more efficiently not only material goods, but also social forms, institutions, languages, and communities.[2] Historically, mathematics was also an important element in the development of science and technology.

On the other hand, Jean-Pierre Marquis believes that mathematics is simply an auxiliary technology - a means for investigating (one could say representing) the world - which can be used or not, and which therefore has no existential or ontological weight. In his view mathematics is valuable in science because, depending on the situation, it may be more convenient, simpler or more economical than alternative means, and this does not mean that it helps us to see the world the way it is. Similarly, philosophers who take ""metaphysics"" very seriously as an attempt to analyse the relation of mathematics to reality tend to see the discipline as more artificial and entirely optional.[3]

980,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," contribute to what is known as the fitness paradox. The fitness paradox reveals to us a significant split in the motivation behind exercise. On one hand we see results-focused fitness regimes that fail to deal with the causes of physical and mental illness and often more importantly with the reasons why people are not able to exercise in the first place. On the other hand there are less medically oriented programs that promise illusory benefits, focusing mainly on a superficial and temporary change in body shape. In this article I intend to illustrate the inherent problems of the first type of program and to describe the strengths of various more holistic approaches to exercise that can effectively help people with mental health problems regain health and independence. It is only when we take a holistic approach to our health and fitness that we can begin to achieve optimal results that include body, mind and spirit.
Fitness and exercise has a way of hijacking our inner drivenness and desire to be more. For instance think about bodybuilders who use steroids, they use these potent drugs for the sole purpose of bulking up. A regular exercise program can certainly achieve the same effects as steroids but is this the kind of body that we really want? We do see as a generalization that people who use steroids end up with very few cardio-vascular attributes, imbalanced endocrine glands and an enormous amount of stress on the body and/or the central nervous system. There is therefore a clear relationship between stress, the use of drugs, poor health and mental illness.
It is understandable that athletes and the less health conscious use steroids or other drugs as a means of achieving the image of a perfect body. It is reasonable to assume however that through the regular use of these and other forms of drugs for the purpose of body sculpting, we can begin to see how using these drugs can be no different than using other drugs such as tobacco or cocaine. It is our constant search for the perfect body that can easily drive us to make poor decisions for a short term gain and usually at the expense of our long-term health. Through all of these negative experiences and feelings we may also develop even more self-deprecating thoughts and feelings about our bodies and ourselves. Only when we can successfully modify our self-defeating thoughts and feelings can we begin to restore our mental health.
The common misconception of fitness is that exercise alone is enough to give us our desired results. As a result, those not able to physically exercise on a regular basis are often taught to continue to have unrealistic expectations about their exercise regimen and may simply give up their program as a result.

The robots, called haikin (meaning ""agricultural mechanization helpers""), were primarily used for planting rice seedlings. The robots were controlled by GPS and were capable of following rows of plants, planting seedlings, and spraying pesticides.

In the 1990s, robots began to play a larger role in agriculture in the US and Europe, as farmers sought to increase productivity and reduce labor costs. One early example was the use of autonomous tractors, which could operate without a driver and were able to cover large areas of land quickly.

In the 2000s and 2010s, robots became more advanced and sophisticated, with the development of robots that could perform a wider range of tasks. For example, robotic harvesters have been developed that can pick fruit and vegetables with precision, reducing waste and increasing efficiency.

Today, robotics is playing an increasingly important role in agriculture. Robots are used for tasks such as planting, harvesting, and monitoring crops. They can perform tasks more quickly and accurately than humans, and can work around the clock, reducing the need for human labor. Additionally, robots can reduce environmental impact by minimizing the use of pesticides and other chemicals.

Overall, robotics in agriculture has the potential to revolutionize the industry, increasing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving sustainability.

This information is great! Can you give me some more examples of how robots are being used in different stages of agriculture? Yes, absolutely! Here are some additional examples of how robots are being used in different stages of agriculture:

1. Planting: Robots are used to plant seeds and seedlings into the soil. These robots use GPS technology to accurately place seeds in a consistent and precise manner. One example of a robot used for planting is the Trimble Ag Leader 3600 field network controller, which is capable of real-time measurement and mapping of soil properties.

2. Harvesting: Robots are used to harvest fruit, vegetables, and other crops. These robots use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to identify ripe produce and pick it without damaging it. One example is the AgroRobot, a robot that can harvest tomato plants and grapes.

3. Irrigation: Robots are used to monitor and control irrigation systems. These robots can detect soil moisture levels and adjust the amount of water being delivered to crops, ensuring they receive the right amount of water for optimal growth. An example of a robot used for irrigation",492,4,2618

These questions have been made in history courses and lectures all around the world, among many other curricular aspects.
In Europe, it is common to study European or European-focused history at the university. And it is not totally unheard of to study American and UK history, but typically this requires being an American/EU Citizen or at least living in a European country.
I am from the US, so how am I able to study European and American history? Who is ""allowed"" to study history?
At UV+, I have the opportunity to study all of this ""with the best teacher in Europe"" as the saying goes (Well, according to the kids in my class at least). Moreover, he is teaching us everything from beginning to end, from the beginning of the world until now. Together, we write our own history, with what we can learn from our own experiences, be it from working at a day-care centre, studying information sciences, or getting lost in the forests of Lapland.
From day one, our professor, Exekiel Wipl, expressed in his class that we're writing history and that our ability to think critically about the world is more important than having learned the 'correct' history.
On the first day, when he asked who wanted to take the exam, all of us raised our hands. ""Me"" wrote Exekiel, while pointing his index finger down. The others all pointed to themselves, a small group of students. The silence grew when he asked again, which had a different effect.
The circle of non-attentive students became shorter and the groups started making room for the other students.
After some time, our professor realized that he needs to adjust the course material and 'content'. But that's what makes him the best professor, he is able to explain all of this new, possible, method. Which is already teaching the very thing he wants us to learn from this: History is not linear and can not be replaced with facts.
For example, if you don't have in mind the experience of the 1960s and 70s, or what it was like to be 10 when WWII ended, you can never relate to all that you're talking about. There is always something more to know and question. History needs to be done right now, with context and due dates. Otherwise history stays where it was",512,4,2349

There lived a man named Yohezzlzipp.  
He was a explorer, all about to play,
His love of learning, that kept him spry.

In his tiny spaceship, he'd blast into the blue,
Exploring space, where no one had been before.
With a gusty sigh and a tickle of his nose,
Yohezzlzipp set out to do the unusual.

His spaceship wiggled, his engines roared with cheer,
A shining spectacle above the moon's big clear.

Flying higher he reached, way up high above,
Beyond stars and planets, he wished his adventure would grow.

He swooped down through valleys of nebulae,
Exploring every galaxy he could see.

Through swirls of asteroid dust he flew,
Gallant little ship of Yohezzlzipp, oh what a view!

Gazing far and near he wondered aloud,
""Are we alone in this vast, boundless world?""

He spied Earth from afar, the blue-green gem,
Where life exists and every planet belongs.

""I must go back,"" he said, his heart filled with glee,
""To help the plants, so all can have an ease.

For every living thing requires water and light,
And our amazing Earth, supplies it throughout the night.""

The spaceship took off, dusting off from space,
A new mission planned, beyond the gate.

Yohezzlzipp traveled back to Earth, with love in his heart,
He wants to help nature, so life there can start.

With a spring in his step, he began his work,
To save our blue planet, filled with so much power.

The people of Earth, they all looked on high,
As the spaceship descended, from that far-off space, high.

It landed gently, bringing with it hope,
That Yohezzlzipp's mission would forever cope.

""Yohezzlzipp, you're our hero!"" children called out loud,
As the little space explorer, outshone the starlight cloud.

Now we all live in harmony, in a new age,
Thanks to Yohezzlzipp's brave heart, in every age.

So here's to Yohezzlzipp, the hero of space,
He saved Earth with love, without any grace.

986,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Machine learning has a rich history that spans over several decades. Machine learning techniques have evolved over time, from the early days of statistical models and rules-based systems, to the more advanced machine learning algorithms and techniques used today. The roots of machine learning can be traced back to the 1950s, when computer scientists and mathematicians began to explore the idea of developing machines that could learn from data.

In the 1950s and 1960s, machine learning techniques were primarily focused on developing statistical models that could be used for pattern recognition and prediction. One of the most famous early machine learning algorithms was the perceptron, developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. The perceptron was a simple algorithm that could learn to recognize patterns in input data, such as images or text, and then output a prediction based on that data.

In the 1970s and 1980s, machine learning techniques evolved to include more complex algorithms, such as neural networks and decision trees. Neural networks were developed to mimic the behavior of the human brain, using interconnected nodes to process and analyze data. Decision trees, on the other hand, were designed to help classify data into different categories based on a series of logical rules.

The 1990s saw the development of more advanced machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and genetic algorithms. These algorithms were designed to solve more complex problems, such as image and speech recognition, and they continued to improve over time.

In the 2000s, machine learning techniques really began to take off. New algorithms, such as neural networks with backpropagation and deep learning, were developed that were able to learn from very large amounts of data. These algorithms were able to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

Today, machine learning is a rapidly growing field, with new techniques and applications being developed all the time. The future of machine learning looks bright, with the potential to revolutionize industries and solve some of the world's most pressing problems.

What are some applications of machine learning in healthcare? Machine learning has a wide range of applications in healthcare, from diagnosis and treatment to patient monitoring and drug discovery. Here are some of the most promising applications:

One of the most important examples of this is the use of facial recognition to control the spread of the disease. The concept was first used in 2012 by the Chinese company Tsinghua University and in 2016, it was introduced in China, with the help of an NGO called Friends of the Earth.
Facial recognition is one of the most exciting innovations to come out of the past few years. Many have begun to use it as an anti-aging tool and it’s one of the only ways to combat the aging process. Facial recognition is one of the most difficult problems to solve. While there are many great ideas that have been proposed for the future, the one thing that would make the most difference is the implementation of such a system.
Facial recognition technology could be used to prevent healthcare workers from exposing themselves to COVID-19 or to help improve the accuracy of COVID-19 testing. Here are a few examples of the technologies that are being considered for this kind of use:
The answer to the problem is now obvious. How? With Face Recognition. The key difference between the system and the current approach is that there is no need for the system to collect all of your biometric data, meaning that it does not need to know all of the information that the system has. Instead, the system is simply able to identify you, based on your unique facial features.
While it’s not possible to eliminate all privacy concerns, a new approach to facial recognition can help to make the world a safer place. It is not only the most accurate, but it is the only technology that provides instant, real-time biometric verification of the user’s identity, so the users are not just automatically approved for access but also get to see their actions in realtime.
In this study, the authors presented a way to use facial recognition technology to control the spread of coronavirus by using this technology. The research was done by two scientists, from the University of Washington and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, who used computer simulations to demonstrate the potential for facial recognition to help prevent the spread of the disease. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
When it comes to facial recognition, facial recognition technology has a lot of potential as a tool for solving many problems. With so much going on in the world, it seems like there should be a way to make our lives better. But, as",509,4,2577

As Edward Gulbransen reminds us in this beautiful collection of concrete poems, though, the poetic image is a visual thing. The poet excites us with a new way of seeing—or hearing—something familiar. The poem usually compels us to respond emotionally or intellectually; its power lies in its ability to shock and surprise. In such ways is the sense of the body and the senses of the body registered as well as evoked in poetry. Playful, tender, and compelling at the same time, Edward Gulbransen's poem ""Heliotrope"" nearly breaks our hearts. That's the power of a poem. There's pleasure in one's own city, and pleasure in the discovery of a new place in the world, and pleasure in another poet's commentary upon it. Our learning about ourselves and our place in the world is made more complete, and hopefully more incisive, by experiencing these images. There's also the pleasure of its cadence and timing; its continued resonance. Poetry is an experience in time, and ""All Arts"" finds Gulbransen at his best with his perception of time and place.

Lewis Carroll, Humpty Dumpty, taught us ""that anything may happen. And often does."" And because of that one simple fact, poetry becomes a magical adventure. In, for example, Edward Gulbransen's book, ""All Arts,"" the reader is willingly plunged into the mystical dimension of language, and further into that other dimension, the poetic act, which of course is involved with what is outside one's own comfort zone. The (meta)phorical world is an essential world of actions where something is never more than one thing. It's a world of manifestations.

Is the evolution of cinema a kind of exotic motion of carbon nanotubes?

Was it hard to change a blacksmith into a mechanic?

Knowing that he could change a stove into something like a bicycle wheel, could Leonardo da Vinci think about making a film?

Who invented the first moving pictures?

It seems that Italians first invented the first moving picture (19720) , however, there is no scientific evidence at all until now. We are looking for other stories and achievements that existed before 1895 (the year of the first known patent for a cinematograph) before even this invention. We don't want to include theoretical advancements. We do not exclude steps that are part of the evolution of movies, however, we should have scientific proofs.

The goal of this question is to expand our knowledge about the birth of the cinema. Like a “story contest”, everyone can share some data about it, and if some of them are good, they can have a reward.

Steeplechase and ice cream - a different day job
I am an artist and work at home. Over the years I have also supported my income by working on a road crew and as a fish farm farmer, the latter two jobs being very strenuous!
What is a fine art brush? How did it come into being?
Years ago I produced a paintings of women on horses in a steeplechase to give as Christmas presents. They were fun to do and I got a massive amount of requests for more of these subjects. There was only one problem - I couldn't find anyone who could supply me with any type of horse painting!
I found a lady who worked at a steeplechase race meet and she recommended a studio in England that sold steeplechase art. This supplied a lot of steeplechase and polo artists. One trip to this studio and I ended up becoming an extra artist, helping out. In exchange for my work in the studio I was given an apprenticeship which led me to painting all types of animals.
But when I wanted brushes for my paintings I could find no one who knew how to make them. Brushes are an area of the art world which I knew nothing about - it was still magic to me!

994,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," I will state a few benefits that might help with coming up with other things that are beneficial to photography.
1. Gives you the ability to capture a particular moment. A particular moment could be something that might not have happened again at a different place or at different time. This is essentially the reason as to why many people love collecting postcards because it reminds them of a particular moment or a trip they took and also reminds them of places they need to revisit or wish to revisit in future. But now, with photography, even that can be captured in a photograph and this benefit is shared with everyone in the world, thus making it a better thing to have.
2. You are able to remember a particular moment that might have passed by for many years, or forever. Let’s say for example when you were a child, you were very close with one of your friends, and you really loved playing with him, going to sleepovers, and spending the whole night playing in front of the neighborhood and screaming as loud as possible and so on. But then one day you had to move away, leaving that friend behind. After moving, that friend might seem to have forgotten about the old times when you two use to play, and that friend might even think you have too. But actually not, and photography helps with that when the person on the other side is able to see the memories you once had with that person, whether it be photos or videos, that would remind them of the good times that both of you used to have and also share it with you. That way, you are able to keep that friendship alive and you can recall the memories that both of you used to have.
3. Photography is a good thing that can be used to attract new customers and increase sales. Imagine if a camera shop has its own brand, and it has photography stuff in stock. You would have to sell them the products before they would want to pay you, but what if you were able to use your photography skills to create a photo shoot with models or even with your clients and use that photo shoot to attract more customers. Attractive photos would certainly do the trick to gain more customers and attention, resulting in more sales.
4. Photography is a way of expressing oneself. By being able to capture a photo, you have a right to do anything you want with that photo, giving you the right to express yourself in your own way, giving you the opportunity to make people come together and share ideas or fun times through the photo.
5. Photography is a way",516,4,2506

Machine learning models take in data, and processes it to answer a query. The built-in tools for machine learning in R provide a framework for doing this.

In R, you can load the machine learning package from CRAN, along with some other useful packages.

There are a variety of different tasks that can be performed using the R package. This post will focus on a small fraction of them. The following topics will be covered:

• Loading data and the training process
• Some basic preprocessing
• Choosing from between algorithms
• Model performance

## Loading in data

Let’s load in some data to play around with using read.csv():

data <- read.csv(""data_csv/iris.csv"")
head(data)
##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa

To begin, let’s look at an example of loading in a lot of different datasets at once.

There are 4 basic ways to interact with and load in data.

• read.csv(): Reads a comma separated variable file.
• read.table(): Same as read.csv, but also uses semicolons as delimiters.
• read.delim(): Used to parse a file with tabs as delimiters. Can include \t in the file name.
• read.csv2(): Used to read in a csv file from a newer version of R.

Be careful about parsing tab delimited files, as they are made up of variable delimiters separated by tabs. This can make the data hard to parse in some cases.

## Data Processing

Data preprocessing is basically just any data manipulation that is necessary for any machine learning project to perform well. It includes things like:

• Cleaning data.
• Removing missing data.
• Standardizing numerical data.
• Representing",502,4,2007

Voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir (French) or Preguntas para un coche chico (Spanish) – is a montage of video featuring Mioses Paredes cruising through Bolivia in a modified car. Using a customised GPS and a mobile phone with a digital map, Paredes created a fun and engaging montage of interviews and pictures of people he meets in the streets while driving and recording his views of the landscape, locations, people and culture. With his voice-recorder he made short recordings of people and conversations which accompanied the video on the internet – a parallel world, we may imagine, where narrations are sequenced by the individual viewing.
The work is the result of an ongoing collaboration with the Bolivian town of Oruro; where Paredes spent some time in 2005 as an artist in residency. Furthermore, Paredes plans to use these experiences to create even more entertaining material and to reach even more people. In other words: on the Internet no one knows you're a dog.
The collaboration may well be an example of how technology is integrating the world into a new kind of global network, and also how the Internet is growing as a space for dialogue and creativity.

In fact, in the nation of The United States, most people are able to drive to a state or more near or far from their home base. The kind of travel you might take is not really limited to the distance traveled and that is one of the wonderful things about being able to travel in a vehicle.
If you have the flexibility to be able to make a long journey using the automobile, then you can find yourself just about anywhere on the planet if you have the time and the resources to do so. Long distance travel can take a lot of preparations for any of us. When you leave one point and head for the next, you must consider a number of things. You might want to consult your vacation map and look at the roads, for instance, so that you will be sure to get out of one town and into the next without a hitch. The last thing you want is to get hopelessly lost when you’re en route to your vacation spot.
You may also want to start learning where you are at least in general in case you find yourself in an emergency situation that requires you to know where you are and have a little idea about the terrain in that general area. In general, though, long distance travel can be quite an enjoyable way to travel. It is always fun to go someplace new to you and you can make memories of that trip that will last a lifetime. It can be like a date trip, a mountain vacation, a city escape, or the beach or a romantic getaway that can make a great time for you and that special someone in your life.
Of course, long distance travel can have some positives as well as some negatives. Most people avoid driving too far from home, of course, because if there is a problem with the vehicle, you don’t have an easy time of getting help on the road. A breakdown of your vehicle can really make you long for home and you might wish to be traveling in a smaller, less expensive vehicle that you can more easily fix if needed. Cars can be expensive to repair as well as just plain expensive to buy in the first place and if you are driving a very large vehicle, the cost of fuel can add up and might make some of the vacation destinations seem out of your league.
Bigger cars can also take up more room and be more dangerous if you are trying to drive through residential or even rural areas. Of course, it’s also important to know when to",516,4,2433

1005,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,"—what, in your view, makes it more than just a mathematical and statistical tool for mapping and manipulation? A lot has been said, and continues to be said, about the cultural significance of machine learning.  I'm not a specialist in cultural studies, so I'm not qualified to offer an exhaustive answer to this question.  Here are a few reflections that come to mind:

One thing that makes machine learning special from a philosophical point of view is that it seeks to bridge ""artificial intelligence"" with ""artificial sociability"": to construct systems that possess intelligence in the same sense that humans do, in that they are capable of problem-solving and making decisions, but at the same time, are capable of engaging in relationships with humans.  For example, chatbots are an active area of research.  Chatbots, of course, are *not* actually conscious and *do not* experience sentiment: they ""understand"" language and are able to mimic human conversation, and that's about it.  But the hope of the researchers is that they will come to understand how to construct systems that not only answer questions, but that understand the human context within which the question is asked and the answer might be applicable, and that in turn express their understanding and context within their answers.

At the other end of the spectrum, I believe that machine learning is really, really good at measuring sentiment.  This does not just mean sentiment analysis.  It means really understanding what's in a human voice, really understanding the structure of what a person says, really understanding what they mean, in the context of the culture they are part of.  For example, you could write a machine learning program that takes a song as input, and outputs the ""preferred"" emotional context: romantic love, betrayal, whatever.  This system would be valuable for predicting what the artist was intending, but it would also be interesting to see whether people's tastes were correlated with their predicted emotional context.

Data is also coming from many cultures and parts of the world, that have previously been underrepresented, or that weren't analyzed at all.",425,4,2167

Analyze and compare different theories about the evolution of the earth, such as plate tectonics and continental drift, and assess the importance of these theories in shaping modern geology. Additionally, discuss the impact of human activities on the earth's geological processes and the role of environmental scientists in addressing these issues. Finally, evaluate the current challenges facing geologists and explore potential future directions in this field. The history of geology can be traced back to ancient times, with early civilizations such as the Greeks and Egyptians studying the earth's surface and rocks. In the early 19th century, geology began to develop as a distinct scientific field, thanks in part to the work of Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Lyell, who introduced the idea of uniformitarianism, which stated that all geological processes occur at a consistent rate over time.

During the 19th century, geologists began to study the earth's structure and the processes that shape it, such as plate tectonics and continental drift. The theory of plate tectonics proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912 postulated that the continents had once been part of a single supercontinent, which eventually broke apart and drifted apart over time. This theory was expanded upon in the 1960s by geologists such as Harry Hess and John Tuzo Wilson, who proposed the theory of continental drift, which suggested that continents move in response to the movement of tectonic plates.

The importance of these theories in shaping modern geology cannot be overstated. Plate tectonics has led to a better understanding of how volcanoes, earthquakes, and other geological phenomena arise, and has been critical in identifying mineral resources, predicting geological hazards, and understanding climate change.

In recent years, human activities have had a significant impact on the earth's geological processes. Climate change, deforestation, pollution, and other factors have led to a range of environmental issues, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and soil erosion. Environmental scientists are increasingly studying the interactions between human activities and the earth's geological processes, with the goal of developing strategies for mitigating these impacts and protecting the planet's natural resources.

Looking to the future, geologists continue to study the earth's structure and processes, with an eye toward understanding how they impact human activity and the planet's sustainability. As environmental challenges continue to grow more pressing, the field of geology is likely to evolve in new directions, including the development of new technologies and",497,4,2723
1007,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," labor in the United States is bound with the history of industrial labor unions. Historically, these two things, engineering and labor unions, have been pitted against each other because of their perceived differences. This misunderstanding has had detrimental effects on engineering education and its capabilities to educate engineers for social responsibility. The reason for this debate is due to a history in the United States of technological advancements that was first built on the backs of the mostly working-class engineers. The lasting effects of these ideologies have been the way in which they continue to divide engineering professors and labor unions when attempting to achieve the same goal of preparing future engineers to create a socially responsible society.
It should be noted that although this paper will focus specifically on the engineering labor unions in the United States, the exact same ideology could be applied to labor unions in any industrialized country. Therefore, by discussing labor unions, this paper applies to the wider world of all industries in all industries, not just engineering. This paper argues that any industrial worker that constructs what we often call ""the built environment"" and ""technology"" should be considered labor because the word labor is defined as ""any work that is the result of physical exertion"" (""Labor,"" The Free Dictionary by Farlex). The consequences of this idea are endless and provide an interesting perspective on what labor is, and more importantly, what the ramifications of labor are and how they can be utilized.
In addition, this paper will attempt to focus on the two areas in the United States where social responsibility and labor unions have traditionally been at odds with each other. First, there is the debate between unionization and freedom, as is seen in manufacturing industries. Second, there is a similar debate between freedom and science, as is seen in engineering, technology, and scientific education. These two topics both require a discussion on the effects of mass technology. In order to make this argument, this paper will show the strengths and weaknesses of various arguments and then discuss what the idea of the ""common good"" has to offer as a solution to the divide between labor unions and engineering students and professors.
One argument that has traditionally opposed labor unions and any use of science or technology is a naturalistic, anti-industrial argument. James Joyce (1882-1941), a novelist who was part of the Modernist group of writers, speaks to such notions of a nature-based environment where man created culture and then destroyed it through technology (""The Loss of the Birds""). In Joyce's Dubliners, Joyce tries to depict how the city of Dublin in Ireland has",521,4,2784

Riemann zeta (ε-regularized series)

July 15, 2010, 5:00 am

With all the Dirichlet eta (ε-regularized series) madness going on, it’s time to talk about some other zeta-regularized stuff.

The one who many people find most mysterious is Riemann’s famous zeta function, which was (partly) named after him because his zeta-regularized series (in the critical strip) looks a lot like this zeta function (of negative even integers):

This was all the evidence needed to deduce that the expected value of the prime counting function was something like (2π2/3 ln2). But the mathematical arguments for this more general series were, in my opinion, always really circular. We knew the zeta function was something kind of special because of the connection to prime numbers, but this connection was just asserted. Today the physicists seem to be (or at least claim to be) much more circumspect in claiming they know something because of a connection to some other field, but mathematicians seem to work really hard to prove things in one field because of a connection to some other field. This continues to drive mathematicians crazy, because there’s no real connection between the two.

Riemann got the right number after all. Not only is the function on the right equal to the the summation he wrote down on the left, but if you call it the Riemann Zeta function, and claim that it has an expansion of the form:

$\displaystyle \zeta (s) = 2^s\pi^{s-1}\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\Gamma (1-s)\zeta (1-s)$

(where ζ denotes the Riemann zeta function) then the claimed summation series is actually equal to the right-hand side. His famous formula is:

$\displaystyle 1 + 2\zeta (2) + 3\zeta (3) + 4\zeta (4) + \cdots$

Of course if you expand the right-hand side you get (an easily computable approximation to) the geometric series:

$\displaystyle 1 + \zeta (1) + \zeta (2) + \zeta (3) + \cdots$

which matches our mental picture for how the Riemann zeta function should look (it’s kind",499,4,1984

Robotic systems can perform a variety of tasks, such as assisting with surgeries, monitoring patients, dispensing medication, and even interacting with patients through natural language processing.

One of the most significant benefits of robotic technology in healthcare is its ability to enhance surgical precision. Robotic systems can be programmed to make very small, precise movements during procedures, reducing the risk of complications and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, robotic systems can work around the clock and in environments that may be too dangerous for human surgeons, such as in disaster relief situations or areas affected by war.

Another application of robotic technology in healthcare is in patient monitoring. Robotic systems can track vital signs and other health indicators, alerting healthcare professionals to potential problems before they become more serious. This can help reduce the need for costly and invasive medical procedures and improve patient outcomes.

Finally, robotic technology can be used to improve the quality of care for patients. Chatbots, for example, can interact with patients through natural language processing, answering questions and providing information about their health. This can help patients feel more comfortable and empowered in their healthcare decisions, improving the overall patient experience.

Can you provide some examples of successful implementation of robotic technology in the healthcare industry? Sure! Here are some examples of successful implementation of robotic technology in the healthcare industry:

The system is designed to help surgeons perform more accurate and precise surgeries, resulting in better outcomes for patients.

3. telerobotic surgery: telerobotic surgery involves the use of telemedicine to allow surgeons to perform surgeries remotely. Surgeons use a robotic arm to operate on patients in another location, such as a different hospital or even a different country. This can help reduce the need for patients to travel long distances for complex surgeries.

1949 - 1960 - Known worldwide as the second World War, a time in which secrets were kept and shared with only few. As a result, almost everything written became a method of communication and this was mainly through hand written letters.
1960 - 1980 - In this age, starting with the introduction of computers for the purpose of cryptography, it could be said the encryption was complicated and people were easily identifyable because of the ‘brute force’ method used to recover words and messages.
1980 - 2000 - It was with the introduction of computer programs, scripting languages and operators that made it more difficult to decrypt. Still, as technology advanced, more robust cryptography was demanded for big business, government and the military and nothing has been the same since.
2000 - 2020 - With the first recognised computers able to be created in the mid 1900s, it’s always been one step ahead of the algorithm and today is no different. Advanced cryptography techniques are being used to crack known encryption algorithms to serve purpose and information needs.
As you can see, it’s safe to say that the advances in technology have been on a fast track in the past few years. The vast usage of various sites today has made it more difficult to 'snag' information and keeping it secret.
The world we live in is a fast pace, changing one. Its impossible to tell when or how much the future might change it, but you can rest assured, it will continue to create new challenges.
Encryption has a vital role to play with today's technology and will continue to for the foreseeable future.",448,4,2244

Fashion has become an integral part of modern life, with its relevance deepening with the passage of time. It has become an indelible part of our lives, playing a crucial role in many social, cultural, and political contexts. The impact of fashion has been immense, with its influence in shaping the way people interact, communicate, and even think about themselves and others.

One of the most significant impacts of fashion has been its ability to shape social identities and individual identities. Fashion trends have the power to build social norms and values, influencing how we interact with one another, how we express ourselves, and how we present ourselves in public. This is especially true in today's age, where social media has made it easier than ever to connect with others and express ourselves in a way that highlights our individuality.

Moreover, fashion has a profound impact on our mental health and well-being. The latest trends and styles help us feel confident, attractive, and empowered, enabling us to express ourselves and create a sense of self. Studies have shown that individuals who dress in more fashionable clothing are more likely to report a positive self-image and greater self-esteem. Thus, fashion has become an essential component of the modern lifestyle, with its impact extending beyond the physical realm.

Fashion has played a crucial role in shaping political and cultural contexts as well. Clothing has the power to express political and cultural messages, reflecting social and political issues and values. For instance, in the 1960s, fashion played a crucial role in the feminist movement by challenging traditional gender roles and promoting female empowerment. Moreover, fashion has the power to set the tone for cultural events and celebrations, with its significance growing as fashion has become more globalized and inclusive.

In conclusion, fashion has become an integral part of modern life, with its influence extending across a range of social, cultural, and political contexts. From influencing individual and social identities to expressing political and cultural messages, fashion has the power to shape the way we think, act, and feel about ourselves and others. Therefore, fashion will continue to be a vital component of modern life, reflecting the changing values and needs of society.

That's a great overview of the importance of fashion in modern society. Can you tell me more about how fashion can impact cultural values and celebrations?
Certainly! Fashion can have a significant impact on cultural values and celebrations by reflecting and shaping the cultural narratives and expectations. For instance, clothing can be a powerful tool for celebrating cultural events and traditions, helping to convey a sense of unity and cultural pride.

A depth of talent in dramatic monologues is on display in the Leon M. Goldstein High School drama department's performance of Caryl Churchill's Mr.昆仑.
The audience with its eyes, ears, and spirit swept up in a sad pathos, the opening monologue was delivered eloquently with precise accuracy as a fumbling old man in a hospital room.
The same monologue was barked by his daughter later in the play as the personality transformation required to come to terms with the stultifying retirement their world has become.
The relationship between each of them so compelling, one, perhaps because it depicts to the audience how tenuous the threads that bind our characters can be, the other because it reveals the complexity and range of a character in every stage in our lives.
Unlike a screenplay, a monologue is performed only by one person, the dialogue is bound in an environment of up to three other actors, positioned in the background of the stage.
So while the audience can follow along and empathize with the actions and changes of the main character through the monologue, they cannot observe nuances in the interactions between the other characters.
What they can see is a situation so novel that it jolted me from my seat, as though I was trying to create for myself an extra dimension in what I was watching. There was a third actor doing an important scene, obscured from the audience's view, and I think it effectively showed off how open-ended the production could be.
In this area of storytelling, the stage is more akin to a living novel than a series, with multiple opportunities to consider and adapt it to its own story.

Misconceptions about photograph are rampant and spread like weeds. The problem is that there are so many different types of photography that all use and describe images in different ways. The term photo is thrown around freely because it's the easiest way to define the entire universe of photography.
In this article we will point out some of the most common photo misconceptions. Although the title would have been more accurate if it read ""... about the different types of photography..."" the large variety of photography techniques makes it impossible to cover all of them.
So without further ado, let's take a look at the following most common photo misconceptions:
Belief: Taking a picture is the same as using a camera.
Realization: This is a pretty obvious one, but camera equipped cell phones and modern digital cameras have made it easier than ever to capture photos, almost instantaneously.
Truth: To create a quality photograph, first of all you have to decide what the goal of the photo is. What story will it tell, what feeling should the spectator experience when looking at it and how will it differ from other photos?
The photographer must think about everything - colors, light, sharpness, composition and much more before he starts pressing the shutter release button. That is why great photographs do not come at a press of a button.
Belief: Professionals get the best photos.
Realization: No, not always. Very often it is necessary to take many photos in order to find the best one. And not every professional photographer does this, either. It depends on the person and the purpose of the shoot.
Truth: A photographer can always improve. As new technologies are being introduced and many photographers experiment, the job gets more interesting and demanding each day. It's a thing of constant change and development.
Belief: The quality of the camera determines the quality of the photo.
Realization: One of the biggest misconceptions about photography is how shallow it is. Just because you own a fancy DSLR does not mean that your photos are flawless.
Truth: There is more to photography than just a fancy camera. It depends on the photographer, his experience and ideas. A great camera, on the other hand, can sometimes be an obstacle because it influences the photo very much. It can even ruin an otherwise great shot.
Of course, only when you don't understand what you're doing. The camera can also be misused by amateurs if used incorrectly.

1021,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Physics is the scientific study of matter, energy, and the relationships between them. It aims to discover how the universe works by understanding the behavior of the fundamental particles that make it up and the forces between them. Physics can be divided into several subfields, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and modern physics. Many branches of physics, such as chemistry and engineering, are founded on classical mechanics, while quantum mechanics and modern physics deal with subatomic particles and energy fields, respectively. For example, the study of the structure and behavior of atoms and their constituents, including protons, neutrons, and electrons, is a key area of physics, while the theory of relativity and the nature of gravity are considered to be part of modern physics.

explain the theory of relativity in simple terms First, let's define what we mean by relativity. Relativity is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of objects that are in motion or are at different speeds from each other. Two types of relativity exist, special relativity, and general relativity.

Special relativity is the theory that describes the behavior of objects that are moving at constant speeds, such as trains or cars, and explains how the laws of physics work the same way for all observers, regardless of their speed.

General relativity, on the other hand, is the theory that describes the behavior of objects that are moving and changing their speed and direction. It explains how gravity works and how it is related to the curvature of space and time, known as the ""curved space-time"" model of the universe.

The theory of relativity, as a whole, is a set of mathematical equations that describe the behavior of objects and how they move through space and time. These equations are based on Einstein's work, and they have been tested and confirmed many times over the years, making them one of the most accurate and well-supported theories in all of science.

What are the LHC and Atlas? LHC stands for Large Hadron Collider, and it is a particle accelerator located in Geneva, Switzerland. It is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world, and it was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in collaboration with many other countries.

The LHC is used to create and study high-energy collisions of subatomic particles, such as protons and lead ions, at very high speeds. These collisions produce energy in the form of x-rays and gamma rays, which can be detected by the detectors at the LHC",515,4,2608

For more than two decades this view has been defended on purely informal grounds, with only rudimentary outlines provided by the formal treatment by Kleene's incompleteness theorem, Feferman's technical analysis of semivarieties, and results obtained by Turing on recursive functional systems. We give the first complete exposition of the informal theory of recursion and mathematical induction in partial orders and of their formal counterparts.

Why fundamentals and valuation might take a back seat to technological disruption
Many investors have for a long time been focusing on companies with strong fundamentals, a quality leading edge in the form of technology, or strong valuations. Today there is a new way of investing in companies and an approach that is not yet familiar to everyone. It’s called “pure tech”. And technology has become of primary importance in the strategy of our funds. Why? Fundamental and valuation considerations are secondary, the line between technological disruption and business models is less obvious. This opens up opportunities for investment and investment strategies. What changes, how does it change, how should it be prioritized in the strategy for the new age?
If we don’t take a closer look, we will miss the opportunity. Have we not recognized the significance of technology for a long time? In 2010 we evaluated companies based on a concept called Technology-driven Transformation, which defined key companies by whether or not they carried out digital transformation and how deep was the implication of change in their business models. In our analysis we looked at more than 150 companies and its then completely unclear if this was just an effect of structural changes or if this reflected a fundamental trend. We came to the conclusion that there was a structural change in our environment as well as a growth and innovation effect, in that companies are advancing technologically faster and transforming their own business and value chains more broadly.
Before looking at pure technology, let’s have a closer look at the characteristics of companies who master digital technologies:
What we can expect with digitalization
Technology companies focus on disruption, since value is based on the transformation of existing business models. The research department of a technology company can quickly turn market technology trends into business model opportunities. The world of smartphones provides good examples: First there was Apple that went on to launch the iPhone and defined a new business model that turned around the entire smartphone business. Similar disruptions can happen in completely different sectors. The new smartphone established new kinds of business models and software solutions are becoming key in this context. Google Maps replaced printed maps and centralized many requests and actions (also known as business services) into its cloud. Based on this technological approach, market players have been able to integrate complex services such as reservation systems and navigation technologies into their platforms. The competence for artificial intelligence and machine learning enables new ways of working in many branches. In the banking and insurance sector, this can mean personalized services and more effective and relevant interactions with clients, or optimization of key processes. Intelligent solutions",514,4,2946

- The first commonly used musical instrument is the flute. These were not just used as a musical instrument, but also an instrument to tell stories. Apart from that, these flutes were mainly used by the Aztecs, a country in Mexico.
- The second commonly used musical instrument is drums. These were made of animal skins. Their main purpose was to make chants and to mark the rhythm of the song.
- Thirdly, the harp comes in. Its roots are found to be in the 3000 BC and was used as an instrument to tell stories. These were made of strings to accompany the songs. Harps have also been used by musicians as a process of tuning during different stages of their life.
- Fourthly, the piano has gained a lot of popularity with time. These are made with the use of few strings instead of whole strings as in the harp, of wooden keys instead of animal skins. In addition to that, these are also able to have a certain volume by increasing or decreasing the amount of pressure applied on the strings.
- Lastly, with the evolution of technology, various musical instruments were made for more effect, so that the music could be better understood.
Summary:
- While exploring the evolution of music instruments, we can see that the culture, history and values of the people had also strongly influenced the choice of instruments.

Have you been to the eye clinic at the Des Moines University this past year? If so, you likely noticed the mural on the wall in the exam room describing how livestock, the most agricultural-centric industry in the state, are contributing to atmospheric carbon dioxide.
It displays a chart with the decay of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which has nearly doubled since the industrial revolution. We see temperature increases at 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. The source of this increase? Humans, primarily the aviation industry and cars.
Three of every four cars ever built are still on the road, thus burning fossil fuels is not the only pollutant we face.
We also emit methane, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over 20 years. When talking about methane, don’t forget cows, piggeries, and farms with manure ponds.
Our production agriculture industry has a lot to answer for when it comes to our state’s climate, and I would venture to guess that Iowa lawmakers don’t know a lot about it. Earlier this year, I wrote a check list for legislators, highlighting some common misconceptions about farming. One comment I received about the list was: “Every lawmaker in Iowa should have a copy of that checklist on their wall.”
So here is another list for policymakers of another topic Iowa needs to get right.
Be worried about climate change.
The global science consensus is that climate change is real, and humans are responsible. We are already seeing its effects, which include: the effects of Hurricane Katrina, disappearing arctic ice, the sea level rising in New York City and, most worryingly, the spread of diseases from mosquitoes to ticks.
The Iowa Department of Public Health found that between 1995 and 2015, the incidence of Lyme disease in 192 counties jumped 675 percent.
Last year, there were a record 1,225 power outages in Iowa, causing stress for residents and businesses.
Get the science right.
As we see an increase in the number of natural disasters, the cost and impact have increased. This should not be a surprise as a warmer climate means stronger winds.
In 2017, 3.6 billion dollars were spent in Iowa on drought, agriculture, flood, and insurable losses, that’s nearly twice the 2000 spending, even though our population has doubled since then.

Chemistry education has a poorer record of research funding and impact than any other STEM subjects.

A recent report has indicated that chemistry educators are under-represented in funding applications to the two main UK research funding bodies (the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)), and that the sector attracts substantially less research funding than any other STEM discipline. The report also highlighted that researchers in chemistry face specific challenges in receiving government recognition for their research work, on top of the myriad challenges faced by researchers within the STEM and other academic sectors in UK higher education.

Is this damning assessment just a case of ‘devilish details’, or are the fundamentals of the debate not as widely heard as they should be? Consider what follows to form your own opinion, and feel free to share your views at the end of the blog.

How does the sector compare?

The results of a study looking into funding and impact for chemistry and other STEM research, across time and subject areas, were published in a report this year. The authors of the study (one of whom is an active researcher in one of the UK’s leading chemistry departments), and the study itself have received a wealth of media attention: The Guardian gave front-page coverage to the study, with a wealth of other mainstream news outlets (including BBC News, The Independent and The Telegraph) widely reporting on the findings. The report was also covered in the US-based Scientific American, and the Times Higher Education gave comment from one of the report’s authors.

Studying trends between 1998 and 2014, the report found that research funding in chemistry (defined in this study as both Pure and Applied Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering) has not kept pace with inflation or the rest of the STEM sector. The reported found that between 2007 and 2014, both the percentage of overall UK research funding given to chemistry (around 7%) and the value of this funding declined, with a total cut of 19%. The report attributed this to an ‘erosion of budget’ between 2007 and 2010, resulting in a cut in total research funding of 4%. The erosion in budget then further eroded the latter part of the 10 year period, affecting the very foundation of chemistry research in the UK, and the report warns that this ‘weaknesses ... could still constrain research and innovation at a time",484,4,2527
1028,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," has long been celebrated in literature and films, and being able to step out of your everyday life and experience something new is a dream for many of us. We have thus known for some time that travelling is good for us. Studies over the years have confirmed this, and have given us an insight into what travel can achieve for our wellbeing.
Psychological studies have shown that any holiday or short break away has a positive effect on our mental health. A 2008 study at the University of Surrey showed how people with elevated levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, enjoyed positive psychological effects while travelling, as well as after. And a recent study found that a trip away, regardless of the destination, reduced the stress hormone significantly and almost immediately. This positive boost in mood remained over time, with the study showing that participants became more optimistic about their future, more positive about their current lives, and they felt they experienced more meaning and a greater sense of freedom and flexibility than usual, post- holiday.
And all these effects were felt even among people who do not usually have a holiday planned, suggesting that even a weekend break is enough to boost the spirit.
With even five days away from home being able to increase your health in this way, it’s no surprise that when we look at why this is happening, the impact is mental, not physical. This is because travel helps to lower the stress hormone levels, and lowering cortisol is important for cognitive functioning as well. By lowering cortisol, travel reduces our stress levels, and this, in turn, provides a host of benefits that improve all aspects of our mental health. This explains why, as the aforementioned study found, the effects of a stress-reducing holiday lasted for two years.
So not only is it good for the future, this study confirms that there is a long-term benefit of not just pleasure from travel, but an immediate boost to our sense of happiness, too. We know this is not a coincidence as it’s been shown that just 48 hours away from home can have a significant impact on your sense of wellbeing.
Research even suggests that travel can be just as important for your body as it is for your mental health. Taking some time out of your life and losing yourself in a foreign place is important for a whole host of reasons. It’s no surprise, then, that long-haul flights can be tough on the body, and that many of us feel jet-lagged when we get home, even after just one long haul flight.

At the same time, the online world of computer programming continues to provide new opportunities to expose the inner workings of theater – literally and metaphorically. Digital Art has captured artists’ imagination. Now, at the University of Pennsylvania and three Penn partners—Computer Science, College of Engineering, and Annenberg School for Communication— new “drama” is being created. On May 24th, the first residency by Dakin Matthews, playwright and Director of Dramatic Writing at the Julliard School, kicked off a team based theatrical production.
The Penn Players team consists of students from Computer Science, Theatre Arts, Engineering, and Annenberg School for Communication. Josh Bishop is a third year student in Electrical and Systems Engineering; he is particularly interested in artificial intelligence and computer vision. “I started thinking about digital theater when I realized I could combine these two interests and actually create something exciting. With the constant advancements of technology, this seemed like an opportunity to be a pioneer in digital theater,” Josh notes.
After the play was written, Josh and another Penn student, Katie David, started working on the graphical user interface using a program called Processing. Processing is an open-source programming language for creating dynamic, interactive graphics. It allows the developers to create objects and manipulate them in ways that allow them to express ideas through visual storytelling. Josh also emphasized that, “The UI is one of the most important parts of the product. It allows people to understand what is going on in the play.” Katie described her design process: “When I started, I had no idea how I was going to make it. Now I see all the elements I couldn’t see before. It is interesting how much change can happen so quickly when you allow yourself to think about things in a different way.” Art Director, Branden van Heerden is a third year MFA student in the Design program, Department of Fine Arts. Branden notes, “I started as a graphic designer and I am not trained as a programer. But now I am learning some programming and it is totally changing how I think about design.” As the design of the play moves forward it will be interesting to see how the abilities of the Digital Theater team are further developed.

In Japan, it was customary to carry an inkstone, brush, and paper, allowing individuals to quickly exchange contact information with others in a less formal setting.

In medieval Europe, personal networks played a crucial role in the business community, and exchange of business cards became a vital part of networking and communication. During the Renaissance, when trade and commerce were expanding rapidly, the exchange of business cards became more formal and standardized. In the United States, business cards began to be used in earnest during the late 1800s, with the introduction of the First Class Mail Act, which allowed business cards to be mailed like letters.

Throughout history, business card etiquette has evolved, and different cultures have developed their own customs and traditions. For example, in Japan, the business card is considered a symbol of the individual's social status and is treated with the utmost respect. Japanese business cards are often elaborately decorated, with intricate designs and logos.

In contrast, in the Western world, business cards are more straightforward, with basic contact information such as name, title, company, and contact details. However, some Western cultures have their own unique business card practices, such as South Korea, where the business card is considered a gift and must be presented with both hands.

Overall, business card etiquette has evolved over time from a cultural perspective, with different customs and traditions shaping the way it is used in different parts of the world. Today, business cards remain an essential tool for professional networking and communication.

Wow, it's fascinating to see how the exchange of business cards has changed and developed over time in different cultures. Do you know of any specific examples of how businesses in different cultures may use their business cards differently?

Yes, there are several examples of how businesses in different cultures may use their business cards differently. Here are a few:

1. China - In China, business cards are usually very formal, with intricate designs and logos. They may also be presented in boxes to show respect to the recipient. It is also customary for the recipient to reply with one of their own.

2. Japan - As I mentioned earlier, Japanese business cards are often ornate and elaborate. They are also exchanged with both hands and presented in a specific way, with the information facing",516,4,2799
1032,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," has developed substantially in the twentieth century, with new instruments used to gather oceanographic data in different situations and to study the oceans at scales ranging from meter to global.
Water survey techniques of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century were based on collection of salinity data, on the basis of which depth and areal estimates could be made; thus the ocean floor was surveyed by oceanographers and answered as a (large) body of water bounded by a surface. This concept of an ocean was ""top-down"" rather than being based on the results of in situ exploration of the ocean by instruments.
The invention and subsequent refinement of submarine hydrographic soundings and magnetic measurements have greatly improved our knowledge of the ocean. Radiated seismic waves were first used in the 1930s to image the ocean crust, and were used in conjunction with sonar mapping of the ocean floor by the mid-1950s. Sonar technology is now a routine technique for geophysical mapping of the ocean floor, and for marine geology and mineral exploration.
Sonar instruments are based on passive or active reception and playback of sound energy. Passive systems reflect transmitted or emitted energy from the sea floor and ambient seawater to the instrument (usually a hydrophone) to give an accurate picture of bottom topography. Active systems, typically in the infrasonic range (but some as high as 100 kHz), are employed to measure the ocean acoustic properties and to collect spectral absorption data that characterize the dispersion of acoustic energy in seawater.
Other, more geographically homogeneous, systems have been developed for detailed mapping of seafloor heat flow in the deep ocean. Heat flow is primarily due to radiogenic heating by radioactive decay, and is one of the important systems for assessing the Earth's internal structure. Another geophysical method for detecting internal structure is marine gravity surveys, which infer densities from changes in gravitational attraction as a function of location. Through remote sensing and geophysical mapping techniques we can see the ocean as a (thicker) external shell, supported by the water column and the Earth's interior.
In addition to static systems for mapping, underwater robots and vehicles can be programmed to follow predetermined survey patterns; such systems are commonly used in the oil industry for oceanographic surveys and mine location. Sonar for the detection of submarines and mines is commercially available and regularly used in various settings.
The 1960s also saw the first use of acoustic (towfish) systems to image the ocean floor during oceanographic expeditions. The scientific use of",501,4,2704
1033,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are explained in most introductory textbooks on the subject. Despite the importance of ideas like the superposition of wave functions, the Born rule, the Schrödinger equation, and the Heisenberg picture, the emphasis of these texts is often placed on the seemingly esoteric ideas like wave-particle duality, entanglement, quantum decoherence, and quantum teleportation. Considerable effort goes into explaining why the quantum setup exists, and how we can use it to transmit information, while the ideas that actually make quantum mechanics what it is tend to be elided.
But much of the really interesting content of quantum mechanics depends on the basic principles, rather than things like teleportation. First, there’s the basic logic of the probabilistic description of quantum measurements. Second, there’s the quantum nature of matter. Third, the fact that nontrivial laws of physics are, in principle, possible. The quantum magic is not in the trick itself, but in understanding how it could exist in principle.
These three things may seem like they’re covered in the basics of quantum mechanics, but the physics community is not really running the basics curriculum any more.
- The textbook land. What I’m referring to is the subset of online books and the actual textbooks that have these as their subject matter. Even people interested in the basics tend to rely on a resource like Griffiths, rather than something more fundamental like Dirac or von Neumann.
- The popular press. The popular press likes nothing more than giving weird asides to crank ideas like zero-point energy, remote viewing, and antigravity.
The crash course provides a tour of these. I give the history of the invention of quantum mechanics, explain the basic principles and terminology, talk a bit about the paradoxes that show up from the basic principles, and show how they get fixed in more advanced treatments. It’s not fully self-contained. The goal is to give a taste of the general approach to quantum mechanics and the context in which we use it.
I focused on the importance of the basic principles over teleportation, and the general logical form of quantum mechanical probabilities. This was deliberate, because I didn’t want to depend on a discussion of quantum teleportation, or even quantum information theory as a background for these sorts of ideas. We just sort of happen to use a description of the world like this, and it’s important to make sense of why it can do the sort of things we do with it. This assumption certainly corresponds to the way people actually use quantum mechanics, and not the way",531,4,2605

In light of the recent unprecedented events in Tunisia and Egypt, we're starting in Tunisia as we examine the social, economic and political conditions that led to the self-immolation of a young street vendor and the quick steps taken by politicians to call for general elections, allow for a democratic and peaceful transition, and grow popular support. We then move into Egypt, where the events of Egypt's revolution are analyzed in depth as we compare the regime and protest dynamics to those of Tunisia. Later, we'll pivot to a short look at the historical and cultural context, and then shift to recent developments in Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Syria & Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. We'll close with a timeline to illustrate the continuing importance of the Arab Spring for next month's 100th show.
Stories in today's show: US intelligence analysts say there's no evidence that Iran has increased its nuclear weapons program, which keeps the military option alive in spite of pleas by the US, Russia, China and Western Europe; the Arab League has expanded its observer mission in Syria to include an estimated 1500 observers in response to ""renewed"" violence; a woman who is leading the Somali government said yesterday that she will run in Somalia's upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections this month.
We also catch up with news from past shows on other topics:
• The assassination of Iraqi reformist Vice President Rafie Al-Issawi and 7 other members of his bodyguards-protected convoy by a suicide bomber in Diwaniyah.
• Jordanian security forces were instructed to limit movement into and out of 3 districts in Aqaba due to ""political tensions"" when the security forces were infiltrated by civilian government supporters, who then murdered 3 others on April 20, while police responded by raiding protest camps.

Consider incorporating scientific facts and findings into the story, and aim to create a sense of wonder and appreciation for the natural world. Use descriptive language and vivid imagery to create a sensory experience for the reader. In the heart of the Amazon jungle, a young scientist named Maya was on a mission to uncover the secrets of nature. Her passion for science and nature had driven her to this remote corner of the world, where she had spent months studying the flora and fauna.

As she trekked through the dense jungle, Maya couldn't help but be entranced by the beauty of her surroundings. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and leaves, and the sounds of wildlife filled her ears. The trees towered above her, their leaves rustling in the gentle breeze. Maya felt like she was a part of the natural world, and it was a feeling she cherished.

One day, Maya stumbled upon a clearing in the jungle where a group of monkeys were swinging through the trees. They were the most colorful and vibrant animals she had ever seen, with bright orange fur and iridescent green tails. Maya watched as they played and interacted with one another, marveling at their intelligence and social behavior.

As she continued her journey, Maya stumbled upon a waterfall in the jungle. The sound of the water cascading down the rocks was deafening, and the mist created a rainbow in the sunlight. Maya felt a sense of calm wash over her, and she sat down to take in the beauty of the waterfall.

Maya knew that there were countless scientific concepts that she could learn from her experiences in the jungle. She couldn't wait to see what else the natural world had in store for her. The journey had been challenging, but Maya was confident that she would uncover the answers to the many questions she had about the natural world.

As Maya continued on her journey, she learned more about the scientific concepts that she had discovered. She saw how her observations were connected to scientific theories and research, and she became passionate about the intersection of science and nature. Maya knew that her passion for both would be a driving force for the rest of her career, and she was grateful for the experiences that had led her to where she was today.

The philosopher, when considering such questions, usually focuses on one or two mathematical subjects, typically logic, set theory, proof theory, or the philosophy of physics. 

Question: What is philosophy of math and what is it used for?
The philosophy of mathematics is the philosophical investigation of the foundations, justification, and implications of mathematical knowledge[1][3][5]. It deals with the basic questions of whether and in what way mathematics is a rational enterprise, the extent to which mathematical theories describe a mathematical reality, whether mathematics is unique or serves as a model for other activities, and the extent to which the methods of mathematics can be formalized or automated[1][3][5]. It is also used to clarify and articulate points of difference or similarity between mathematics and other disciplines, such as metaphysics, the theory of logic, and especially computer science[2]. Finally, it can also be used to analyze the assumptions underlying mathematics and help clarify the issues raised by paradoxes[4].",263,4,1388

For the first time, we've been able to record and analyse the electric potential of the human brain for 10 hours, and thanks to this amazing set of images, we can 'feel' the interaction of the electric fields generated by neurons.
The images are the result of a research carried out by a team from the Centre for brain repair, which used an electroencephalography (EEG) to follow the changes in the electric potential across the frontal regions of the brain of two healthy volunteers who wore custom-made head caps with 64 electrodes.
The precise microfabricated electrodes embedded in the head caps were able to record thousands of spikes in each channel, varying in frequency and size, and show the brain's activity at different levels.
However, for one of the volunteers, new neurons were able to generate a silent pattern of electric waves, while another had a high frequency of spikes.
EEGs are currently the basis for many advanced brain monitoring and brain-computer interface devices, but for the first time researchers have been able to analyse thousands of electric waves produced in different frequencies simultaneously.
The researchers state that advanced electrodes can measure thousands of electrodes, to continuously read the frequency of brain waves for a longer period. The enormous potential of such technology is to improve our understanding of how the brain processes information.
Why do we need devices that use neuroprosthetics or bionics?
The goal of these tools is to restore brain function. These people are often people with paralyzing stroke, injury and other disabilities. Now, with the help of advanced technologies, human-machine and human-beings can interact. Robotic prostheses can help people interact in new and different ways and use this technology to restore the patient's lost hand.
Remember that the study group had a good one. The mean correlation between intra-neuron and sub-threshold neural activity increased from 10 to 63 per cent over time. The high-frequency range will follow the cortical firing pattern at the physiological scale.
This advancement of technology has made rapid progress. Even the surgical methods have improved. We now know to move our fingers and apply weight with neural prosthesis.
Does that mean we can design smarter prostheses that mimic the muscle, nerves and senses, and that improve the range of motion? Although the future holds more sophisticated devices than this brain prosthesis.

""I think this is a great field to get into now. Many things that could never have been predicted, like the Inter Planetary Network from earth to Mars, could only happen because of quantum technologies,"" he said.
Quantum technologies involve classical and quantum information processing and communication, quantum sensing and quantum technologies for information security, he said.
""They will have a profound effect on most of our lives. The applications are almost unlimited.""
So far, some people have been wary of the applications because ""they just know how big all of the experiments are"", he explained.
But quantum systems, including sensors and communication links, will be down-sized by quantum engineering. ""Everything is scaled down because you can combine a lot of quantum bits,"" he said.
There will be a quantum network with quantum repeaters that send quantum information over long distances through solid state and could reach a typical node on earth.
For example, the same quantum network could be used by defense agencies in Australia to protect critical infrastructure.
""Future terrorists or criminals would be able to carry around a quantum communication device and use secure channels for all of their communications,"" he said.
Quantum technologies also have vast applications in medicine, including quantum imaging and quantum communications for heart monitoring and cancer detection.
""There is a large global research effort, and we have to get to higher densities of entangled particles. There is still some way to go before these concepts are tested in practice,"" he said.
He is talking about a Q比特, or quantum bits, which currently are a thousand times bigger than a normal bit. ""This is the experiment that many people have been waiting for to show a quantum advantage – where quantum will do something much better than we can do with classical computers,"" he said.
Schleich said quantum mechanics is especially important because it has profound consequences for our understanding of the world.
In the early 20th century, it was argued that the future of science would be understood by replacing its Newtonian mechanics by quantum mechanics.
""This has lead to extraordinary and revolutionary advancements in all kinds of sciences and technology,"" he said.
Albert Einstein described this revolution as a ""miracle"", which ""lies hidden in the manifold isomorphic images"" because the world of the quantum is ""dark, mysterious and incredible"".
But Schleich is optimistic about the future of quantum mechanics.",512,4,2711
1051,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," in the modern world is on the decline as Earth Science loses out to more popular sciences. At the same time, the public has been subjected to overly simplified interpretations of the Earth and the forces that shape it for the purposes of public consumption. As both of these key facets to the development of our society make the importance of geology subject to their changing fortunes, scientific geologists are looking to both stem the tide and shift the cultural discourse from behind the scenes. With the responsibility and opportunity to explain complex phenomena from a personal, fundamental point of view, as well as their position in the public mindset, scientists are recognizing the need to reach out to the public and enlighten them, rather than rely on media to deliver their interpretations.
“Geology is the study of the Earth and its history. This history covers so many time scales that it is not surprising that geologists find many different ways to study it. The language of geology is that of the rock” (Jerry Cook, professor of Geology and geology student at Duquesne University, June 1989).
The modern public is more distant than ever from the technical language of geology, as a result of this growing disconnect so far from the origins of mankind, to which it can clearly trace its lineage, to the tools, industries and technology which stem from it. Geology is of paramount importance to its users, scientists, and the modern public for a wide variety of reasons, many of which are completely ignored by the media and pop culture.
In actuality, geology is the foundation of all things. It underlies the design and structure of modern society, and shapes the history and cultural development of the human race from time immemorial. According to Tim Gregory (poet and creative writing teacher at Duquesne University, June 1989): “Geology keeps secrets that would astonish us, if only we could peel away the veneer of life and reveal the seismic tremors underpinning this very moment.” Geological processes have always been of great interest to man, and the scientific identification, understanding, and study of Earth can not only highlight this, but also its human attributes.
The wide range of human issues dealing with the Earth directly includes natural resource development and management, conservation, weather and climate change, migration, and ultimately, survival. In some of the cases, these human issues are incredibly, and even directly, dependent upon our knowledge of geology: They range from ice ages, through to mining and tourism, to petroleum development and",502,4,2599
1052,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," connected to the future of computing, according to a keynote speaker at the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems.
“The synergy between biology and nanotechnology would drastically change the way we develop therapeutics, do microbiology, and control diseases,” said Volkan Isler, associate professor in the department of Bioengineering and of Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania.
Isler proposed a new paradigm in molecular sensing that is based on advances in three-dimensional sensing, distributed sensing, integrated sensors, mobile sensors, and machine learning systems.
Isler said three-dimensional sensing could improve diagnosis. Traditional microscopes are equipped to look at a 2D slice of a human or animal. Molecular diagnostics, however, “is trying to exploit spatial information that is available from 3D molecules. Not just a 3D model from a virtual or MRi (magnetic resonance imaging) picture, but a 3D physical picture,” Isler said.
Distributed sensing allows a society to know what is in their environment. The Internet of Things is gaining in popularity, and sensor networks are going through a similar expansion. This means that sensors are being developed for many different applications, such as chemical sensing, acoustic sensing, biological sensing, and so on, Isler said.
Another development in sensing is the integration of multiple sensors into one device. One example is the Integrated Uncooled Thermal Imaging (IUTF) sensor. Based on a microbolometer, the IUTF sensor was developed in part by researchers at the University of Maryland.
“This device is basically a Swiss Army knife of the next generation of photonic devices,” said Michael McMorris, co-director of the Integrated Nano Photonics Laboratories and professor of chemical engineering and nanotechnology at University of Maryland.
The device does a whole variety of functions, McMorris said. It is a thermal imager that also can determine material properties like refractive index, temperature, and the status of liquids. In addition, it can determine the refractive index of materials from crystals to biological structures. Some are interested in using it as an imaging platform for cancer diagnosis, according to McMorris. It also can be used as an infrared filter.

It is the interaction between people, both on and off the stage, that allows us to talk about anything and everything that we might want to. It allows us to look into ourselves and discover what we might not be able to in everyday life. Through live theater, we communicate with the actors, allowing them to tell a story, and, in turn, we feel a connection with the characters. We share the story with the people on the stage, those in the audience, and with anyone who has heard about it.
Why you like making theater: What I like about it is the amazing people that you get to work with, the projects you can be a part of, and the creativity that happens. Theater is a place that you can be yourself and create whatever you want, and every time you get to do it, you discover a little more about who you are.
If you could star in any show, what would it be and why: I would love to be in something by Shepard. I’m a big fan of Shepard’s writing. I think “Buried Child” is an amazing play. If I could play any character I’ve always loved this part, Hallie in “Look Back in Anger.” It’s not for everyone, but I love that play. I have a lot of respect for Shakespeare and plays like “Hamlet” or “King Lear,” but I love Pinter a lot, so I don’t know. I’m open to any project that inspires me.

Last night I had a dream, which was more like a flash forward, in which I was lecturing at a quantum conference. The difference between this reality and my dream is that in my dream I can read a lot of papers by instant messenging! This really seemed to make sense at the time. Well, that’s how the future of the blog is going to be. And in fact, I’m going to start the day after tomorrow, with a two-part paper review. Each one is a bit bigger, and it’s a two-paper review, as I’m in the process of putting together a review.

The first part is on Quantum Mechanics and Information Theory. I’m going to do this because the second paper is on applications of quantum mechanics, or quantum information, to, well, basically everything. The result will be a review with lots of links to papers, rather than the more direct approach, where I post the two papers here and you read them. So we’re going to need this space to for discussion.

Second, I want to address the question why isn’t there a more formal definition of quantum information? The answer is because of problems in physics. We can fix most of these problems. There are just a few more that haven’t been figured out yet.

If you want a direct link to the papers, here’s a pdf version. I’m trying out scribd for some of the stuff. I’ll see if I like it for papers, and if so I’ll start using it. I’m starting by only using it for two pages of the paper. When they figure out how to add pictures properly, I’ll use them.

Sure, here are some common misconceptions about machine learning:

1. Machine learning is only used for data analysis: While machine learning is often used for data analysis, it is also used for a wide range of other applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.
2. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence: While machine learning is an important component of artificial intelligence, it is not the same thing. AI involves creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as understanding language or making decisions.
3. Machine learning is easy to implement: Machine learning algorithms can be complex and require significant expertise to implement correctly. It's important to have a solid understanding of the underlying principles before attempting to use machine learning in a real-world application.
4. Machine learning is only for large datasets: While large datasets are often necessary for machine learning, there are also many applications that can be performed with smaller datasets. In fact, some machine learning algorithms are specifically designed for smaller datasets.
5. Machine learning is only for technical experts: While machine learning does require some technical expertise, there are many resources available to help non-technical professionals get started with machine learning.

This iconic species, which had a colonizing a successful conservation effort in Europe, has seemingly become extinct in its native habitat in Morocco and northern Africa, due to poaching for body parts, and poisoning by lead-based weapons. However, the serendipitous encounter with a bearded vulture in the Southern Alps was a stunning indication of a rare return to the wild, and sparked hope for its survival. We offer a review of existing knowledge of the bearded vulture's life-history and discuss how this information can be used to further an understanding of migration in addition to serving as a valuable tool for conservation of this charismatic and 'truly wild' species.
Birds have colonized most terrestrial environments, from ice-wrapped northern, poleward, circumpolar regions to humid tropical tropics (Harrison, 1999; Whittow, 1985). Yet, perhaps the most fascinating manifestation of avian ecological success and widespread species richness is their presence as avian Endangered Species (ES) (Sandercock, 1999) on islands. The arrival of a single introduced species can quickly become so invasive as to create a unique avian landscape dominated by a single fast-breeding species (Baird and Bird, 1990). Invasive species have colonized the entire tropical island chain, including oceanic insular archipelagos and numerous of its most important hotspot, such as the Galapagos Islands (see http://www.joerc.org/abry/open.html), Mauritius (Whyte, 1994), Kauai and Hawaii (Portugal et al., 1999), Madagascar (FitzJohn, 1997), South America (Holmes and Trono, 1995), South Africa (Nel and Morton, 1994; Hilton and Johnston, 1994) and the Antilles (Kamminga and Coussietou, 1994).

1062,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," with emphasis on the major advancements in the field throughout history. Physics has been one of the most significant fields of study since ancient times, with remarkable advancements that have defined our modern world.

The early stages of physics can be traced back to Babylonian mathematics and astronomy, where simple calculations of time and celestial movements were made. Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras, Archimedes, and Aristotle contributed significantly to the development of physics principles.

In the 17th century, the Scientific Revolution began in Europe with prominent figures like Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Galileo's experiments and observations led to the development of observational astronomy and experimental physics. Kepler, on the other hand, provided essential insights into the motions of celestial bodies, which laid the groundwork for later developments in calculus and mechanics.

During the 18th century, Charles Bonnet, an early physiologist and philosopher, proposed the phlogiston theory, a model for combustion that described matter as having 'phlogiston' within it. However, Antoine Lavoisier disproved this theory by demonstrating that combustion was actually a result of oxygen reacting with other elements, leading to the development of the oxygen theory of combustion.

In the 19th century, physics experienced a significant shift with the emergence of quantum mechanics, a concept based on the wave-particle duality that challenged the prevailing Newtonian view of the universe. The contributions of such prominent physicists as Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr revolutionized our understanding of atoms, light, and energy.

Einstein's work on relativity theory further advanced our understanding of space and time. His special relativity theory stated that the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving at constant speeds, while general relativity proposed a new theory of gravity, stating that gravity is not a force but the curvature of space-time.

Another major advancement in the 20th century was quantum field theory, which combines quantum mechanics with special relativity. This theory provided a more coherent understanding of particle physics and led to the development of the Standard Model, which describes fundamental particles and their interactions.

Today, physics continues to evolve rapidly, with ongoing research in areas such as quantum computing, string theory, dark matter, and dark energy. These developments show that the field of physics remains as vibrant and relevant as ever, continuing to shape our understanding of the universe around us.",478,4,2663

For instance, the differential geometry of curved spaces and tensors, complex analysis and some more advanced field theories are completely avoided here. At the same time, there are discussions on more modern field theories like Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons, with a view to making the text relevant for a bright student, who is already equipped with a sound knowledge of classical field theory, but wants to keep his own options open.

Ever see a distressed commercial farmer fretting that he is about to lose a valuable stock through rabies? The quarantined piglet with the green ooze, or the cow with the inflamed, red mouth? Fret not, strangers are drawn to the distress and so there is usually plenty of sympathetic buyers for distressed stock. However, it is much, much more cost effective to prevent disease from happening in the first place.
Veterinarians must assume that all their patients are infected with a host of 'bugs' that potentially can kill them. In practical terms, this means identifying the most important infections we can potentially treat with antibiotics (antimicrobials), and in a parallel fashion, preventing their emergence in the first place. (They tend to be spread by poor housing, confinement, poor diets, and sheer animal density. Overcrowding in bare concrete sheds with poor ventilation and high stocking densities creates an opportunity for infections to thrive.)
A very important aspect of prevention is that disease prevention treatments are generally much cheaper than treatments for a sick animal. For example, one kilogram of stock can be given an injectable solution or a drench once a year and helps to prevent diseases that would cost five times as much if the animal were to get sick. It also helps to sustain the health of a sustainable sheep flock – which actually works out cheaper in the long run!
The ""one health"" concept involves considering the interconnectedness between humans and animals. If livestock get sick, it costs us to treat them (e.g. sick animals have to stay in hospital). It is good for the owner of the livestock to get sick sheep or cows diagnosed and treated, and the beneficial effect is spread to people living in the same household or employed on the same farm. If people get sick (e.g. from a sheep infected with Echinococcus multilocularis, the parasite that causes alveolar hydatid disease in humans, as well as sheep), it makes economic sense for sheep farmers to vaccinate their animals (which is more effective than worming or dosing to control an outbreak of羊肠绦虫 than using anthelmintics in natural pastures).
This leads us to the fifth and final point. We are all a collection of the things we do and do not eat, and the things we do and do not let our animals do and not do. Therefore, how much beef we eat (or chicken, lamb, pork, milk, fish, etc.) is what determines the number of sheep we",532,4,2448

I remember hearing a panel discussion that ran the gamut in the topic of poetry and poetry criticism. Actually, I think it's fair to say that anyone who had considered working in the literary field at some point in their life, would be asked at some point the question of what 'poetry' is and why it's something that matters.
I've never been asked this in the sense of academia, but in a social setting, people have brought up the subject a few times in a large, casual group. I tend to have one of two reactions, depending on the person I am in conversation with: one, I'm like 'no, don't do that,' and then the other is, 'I'd love to tell you about it.' It's hard for me to describe the difference in mental statuses between those two reactions, other than saying one is anxiety-inducing and the other is hopeful.
Some of this might stem from this one day in one class where I waited for this prof for almost half an hour as he typed in and out of the computer lab, and after finally getting to him, he said something like, 'well, the professor has been having issues... you know, with work and stuff....' and I thought, 'oh great, these guys hate us because we're not getting our grades...?'
Of course, we weren't told the specifics about his illness, or why he was in the computer lab, but I figured it out to be 'death or disability.' Our whole class got lost in the vagaries of it because all we could think about was his being late and his inability to deliver the lecture in a timely manner.
I left that class in a completely different headspace then where I had been, at the beginning of the semester. That class was sort of a memory of my nascent time as a college student in that sense. It was the first class where all of the handouts and presentations were automatically online, and I remember everyone being excited that the grueling work of distributing those would no longer have to be endured. This was before mobile internet, as it is now, and so it really seemed like a big burden had been lifted in those classes.
I remember being as obsessed with the moment as I was with finishing the course with high marks.

According to WHO, approximately 2.8 million people annually died from tuberculosis, or one person every 14 seconds. Moreover, WHO predicts that by 2050, the number of tuberculosis will double, since now only about 6.1 million people are infected, and about 1 million died last year. To counteract the spread of this disease, recently, numerous companies have announced the development of innovative vaccines and cures, which will be discussed in the article.
What is tuberculosis?
This disease belongs to the class of microbial diseases caused by the tubercle bacillus (specific human microbe M. tuberculosis), accompanied by suppuration in various tissues. However, in the majority of cases, the pathogenic process is not accompanied by suppuration and has as its localization the interstitial network of the lung (called the infiltration of the lung or lung consolidation). In other cases, pathogenic processes can occur in lymph nodes and in other internal organs (pulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary tract, bones and joints).
For reasons that can hardly be explained, the share of the disease is higher in Asia, and the least it is observed in Africa and Latin America. In the past, tuberculosis was given to the status of the most dangerous infectious disease of mankind, due to the high mortality rate, and in the country it was called the ""white plague."" Based on these data, you can draw the conclusion that at present it is impossible to reverse the spread of this disease.
How is tuberculosis in the lungs transmitted?
Transmission of the disease has two ways: it is either by airborne droplets from a person with active disease, or directly by the person himself (this is the so-called ""direct contact"") (1). Unpleasant fact - the doctor often ignored these symptoms at the early stages, as he saw tuberculosis only at a severe stage of the disease, and completely neglected the main cause of death among the people, which in many cases could be avoided. For example, HIV or AIDS is probably the disease that no one would want to develop, but, unfortunately, in the world, over 23 million of them do not even know it, and that is why more than 1.5 million people died from this disease. As you can see, it is very important for doctors to understand the initial stages of the disease, and, accordingly, find out the source of transmission. Nevertheless, many infected with tuberculosis, and disease do not feel well for a long time",517,4,2480

Photography can be a very rewarding hobby. It’s also very enjoyable for those who just want to snap a few pictures here and there. Photography is so versatile. You can get very creative with it. It’s also a great way to immortalize a very special moment and to capture the beauty of a landscape or a piece of wildlife. If you’re interested in trying your hand at photography, here are some quick tips to help get you started.
Grab yourself a decent camera
Not everyone needs or wants a massive, studio-worthy camera. If you’re just starting out, it’s best to start with a good digital camera. Even if you don’t have a large budget, you can still pick up a nice camera for a reasonable price. Don’t go out and buy the most expensive digital camera you can find, though. You’re likely to find that using a camera body built for photography can be too overwhelming. You may find it difficult to take creative shots. The manual on your new DSLR will likely overwhelm you, as well. If you can’t figure out what settings your camera is on, you’re not going to take a very good picture. That’s one of the big things that sets professional photographers apart from amateurs. They know their cameras inside and out. For the average person who is just getting started with photography, a compact camera is best. It should be able to take high-resolution pictures without having to deal with a bunch of complicated settings.
Take a few classes
If you’re serious about picking up photography as a hobby, you can definitely benefit from taking a photography course or workshop. These classes are extremely useful because you’ll learn a lot more about the basic tools of a camera. They’re also very effective at developing your editing skills. Many photographers don’t have extensive editing skills. They often just throw their photos on Facebook and use a high-quality filter, making the photo seem more professional than it really is.
Ask for feedback
When you start out, you’ll want to show your friends and family your pictures. Give them a few prints. Let them take a look. If they like a particular picture, make sure that you get their email address or phone number. You’re not only going to want to share your pictures with those you know, you’re also going to want to get feedback from people you’ve never met. Sites like Flickr.com, 500px.com, and Etsy.com can be a great place to show your pictures. By creating a blog or a social media profile and using a well",535,4,2459

In my preteen years I played for my neighborhood league, and was decent enough that I was known by my family members as the ""I'll drop this ball"" guy. I got good enough to play alongside my older cousin in our church league. We weren't expected to win, so it didn't matter that we never played by the rules. In high school, despite being physically better than everyone else on my team, I was never given an opportunity to play, so instead I went into journalism and coached a little JV baseball. But I was never good enough to warrant any recognition.
Then during my freshman year of college, I played pickup basketball and tennis against opposing sports teams from Ohio State, and grew convinced that I could play at that level, too. College leagues weren't an option for me, however, because there's too much of a disparity in strength, size and athleticism. I gave that up in order to go to graduate school, where a chance encounter with a friendly gym rat on the basketball court made me reconsider my decision. There was a team working out nearby that I began playing with, but by the time I made the decision to join, the tryouts were over. I had too many credits and too much pride to give up just one semester.
The summer before my senior year of college I went to play some more pickup games with the same gym rat, though, and ran into the coach. He had a friend, he said, who was a player-coach for the AAU basketball team he wanted me to try out for. One tryout, and I was gone. By the time I made it to practice, I was feeling the sun set on my time in the industry. I remember thinking to myself ""this is awful, I can't believe they told me to come here,"" as I broke a zone defense while making a three-point basket. No one needed to tell me twice. I finished the tryout satisfied.
Since then, I've been playing hard. I've been working out, training and getting in extra practice. I still look like my athletic career is just beginning. It was a difficult decision, moving on from my college teammates as a team, and leaving behind my friends in the industry. But it was one I knew I couldn't turn down.

Poetry has been a part of human culture for thousands of years. Its history can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. However, it wasn't until the Middle Ages that poetry began to flourish in Europe.

During the Middle Ages, poetry was seen as a means of expressing religious and philosophical ideas. Christian poets wrote hymns, psalms, and poems on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Islamic poets created poetry that celebrated love and beauty, as well as philosophy and spirituality.

In the Renaissance period, poetry took on a more humanistic focus. Writers such as William Shakespeare, John Donne, and John Milton explored the complexities of the human condition, expressing their ideas through the use of allusion and metaphor. These poets were also known for their use of iambic pentameter, a poetic meter that originated in classical Greece and Rome.

During the Romantic period, poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge began to place greater emphasis on the individual experience and emotion. They used nature and imagination to explore the depths of the human psyche.

In the 20th century, poetry became more experimental and innovative. Poets such as T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams experimented with new forms and techniques, such as free verse and concrete poetry. These poets also challenged traditional forms of poetry, such as sonnets and villanelles, by breaking them down or taking them in new directions.

Some of the most important poets in history include William Shakespeare, John Donne, John Milton, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams. Each of these poets has left a lasting impact on the world of poetry, influencing generations of writers and readers. Today, poetry continues to thrive as an art form, with poets creating new and innovative works that push the boundaries of language and imagination.

It's interesting to see how poetry has evolved over time. Do you have a favorite poet?

The garden was filled with lush greenery, colorful flowers, and the sweet smell of fresh produce. It was the go-to spot for families and friends to gather and enjoy the beauty of nature.

However, one day, a group of people decided to bulldoze the garden to make way for a new building. The people were greedy and wanted more land to build on, so they razed the garden to the ground.

In the aftermath, everything was silent and empty. No birds chirping, no bees buzzing, and no plants growing. The people felt guilty and regretful for what they had done. They decided to work together to bring the garden back to life.

They started by planting seeds and filling the soil with compost. They worked hard and long hours, and soon the garden started to bloom. As the plants grew, they attracted all kinds of creatures like butterflies, bees, and birds. The garden was once again filled with life.

The people learned an important lesson about the interconnectedness of nature. They realized that everything in the natural world is connected, and that one part can affect another. By taking care of the garden, they were also taking care of the environment around them. They learned that the garden was not just a beautiful place to visit, but a source of sustenance and harmony for the people who lived in the town.

Years passed, and the garden continued to thrive. The people made it a place for everyone to gather and connect with nature. They organized events, held picnics, and celebrated the beauty of the garden. The garden became a symbol of hope, resilience, and the importance of caring for the environment.

The people knew that they had a duty to protect nature and to pass on the legacy of their garden to future generations. They worked hard to keep the garden thriving and beautiful, ensuring that the legacy of the garden would never die.

The story about the garden teaches us that nature is not just something to admire or take for granted, but it is something to take care of and protect. We should all work towards preserving our planet and its beauty for future generations to enjoy.

1080,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Art can also be described as how an individual perceives beauty and form in the world. Art can be visual, through drawing, painting, sculpture, and crafts, or it can be articulated through musical performances, vocal performances, script, and acting. Many of these creative art forms can be produced from specific instructions in a text form, like a musical score. 

When making art, the artist is thinking about the specific audience, and they are trying to inform or communicate a message through the style or specific medium, to share and allow the recipient to be in position of experiencing a form of pleasure, information, or beauty that can provide some enlightenment or the feeling of euphoria. 

When crafting music, for example, the artist has a specific message or meaning or a specific feeling they want to convey. In musical form, the musical notes or chord progressions are simply considered data. 

The computer scientist Alan Kay famously said that ""the best art is data that can be understood."" In other words, people will come and experience the art form, and they will try to come up with as much data as possible as to their reason for enjoying the art, or their message they are trying to convey.

Another approach is to use a regular expression search to find patterns that match specific keywords or phrases. For example, you could try searching for terms related to human reproduction, such as ""birth"", ""pregnancy"", ""labor"", ""uterus"", ""ovaries"", or ""sex"". Alternatively, you could try searching for keywords that are associated with significant events, such as ""vaccine"", ""pandemic"", ""mask"", ""social distancing"", or ""Covid-19"".",468,4,2229

1960s: The first robotics in medicine was introduced with the development of the first industrial robot. The robot was used for precision welding, and later, for surgical procedures. However, the use of robots in medicine was limited due to the high cost and difficulty in controlling.

1980s: The first robot-assisted surgical procedures were performed using the Puma560 robot. It was used for heart surgeries and was considered a major milestone in the history of robotics in medicine.

1990s: The da Vinci Surgical System was introduced, which was an advanced robotic system that allowed for more precise and less invasive surgeries. It was initially used for gynecological surgeries but later expanded to include other types of surgeries.

2000s: The use of robotics in medicine continued to grow, with the introduction of the ROBODOC system for spinal fusion surgeries, the STAR Surgical System for prostate surgeries, and the ROCRobot for fracture repair surgeries.

2010s: Robots are being used in a variety of ways in medicine, from telepresence robots that allow doctors to remotely interact with patients to robots that provide assistance with patient care. Additionally, robots are being developed to assist in the design of new medical devices, as well as to aid in drug development and delivery.

Today: Robotics in medicine is still a growing field, with new advancements being made regularly. As technology continues to advance, robots will likely play an even bigger role in the future of medicine.

That's interesting! Can you tell me more about how robots are being used in telepresence and patient care? Yes, absolutely! Telepresence robots, also known as telepresence platforms, have been gaining popularity in recent years as a way to provide medical care remotely. These robots are controlled by a healthcare provider who can see and communicate with patients using video conferencing technology. The robot is then remotely moved around the patient's environment to assess their condition and provide care. 

For example, a telepresence robot may be used to remotely monitor a patient's vital signs or to conduct a physical examination. The robot can transmit images and data to a healthcare provider who is at a remote location, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition.

On a snowy night, a female employee working as a cashier is abruptly fired by her manager. The woman, who has been called by several sexually derogatory names by the manager, believes she is being let go for refusing the man’s sexual advances. She seeks legal advice.
The superiors have their reservations: There’s no formal record of the manager’s inappropriate behaviour.

Since January 2017, more than 3,000 workplace harassment claims have been filed with the Ministry of Labour, under the Eliminating Sexual Violence and Harassment in the Workplace act.
While there may be improvements to be made in the justice system, workplace harassment continues to be a widespread problem in Canada, and the results can be costly.
Fines and court proceedings in the United States resulting from sexual harassment charges have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to the perpetrator, as well as thousands of dollars to the victim, according to Carol Suchar, head of human resources for H2M Engineering in Boston.
“Regardless of whether the victim is a small company, a company of a few hundred employees, or a Fortune 500 company, the objective is to come out of the investigation unscathed and with the offending party held accountable,” Suchar said.
The reality is that few U.S. organizations may be able to afford the thousands, or millions of dollars that comes with employment litigation.
“We are in a sensitive age today in terms of discrimination and harassment in the workplace,” said Maria Candela, president of DMC Search in Toronto.
There is a shortage of qualified human resources professionals and management, which causes workplace harassment, Candela said. Furthermore, after the #metoo movement, she said, there are not enough people in the area to handle sexual harassment complaints and investigations.
The social climate of today’s workplace has made it difficult for companies to avoid allegations. While companies can’t guarantee that they will never be sued, educating managers and supervisors about the company’s Code of Conduct and harassment policy makes it much less likely, Candela said.

For centuries the ocean has been deemed as a dangerous, unknown and uncontrollable thing that is 'lawless'. Today scientists, governments and corporations, increasingly make use of the sea for purposes such as oil, tourism and fishing. How should we treat the unknown? What aspects of the current management approaches of the oceans are ethical in nature? Which are not?
When the ocean is considered within the context of a lawless space it seems as if, as a separate entity of the planet, it is completely uncontrollable and unspeakable. Consider the novel 'Life in the undergrowth' by Charles Darwin (Darwin, 1877). The key words that can describe the facts described, reveal important aspects for ocean ethics. The author explains the dependence on water for sustaining all life on earth, as well as the creation of the oceans, based on the idea that the earth rotated around its axis so fast that oceans ""were forced up as one vast, undifferentiated bed of liquid salt"" (Darwin, 1877). Later on, Darwin speaks about coral, which is used to form island chains, such as that of the Maldives. He describes coral by saying: ""It grows in impenetrable masses, whitening a coastline; and, with its toxic poisons, assailing the fishes by day, while it withholds light from them by night"" (Darwin, 1877). Coral is essentially a bi-product of the Earth's movements.
Although different marine ecosystems were noted in order to cover the needs of humans, they were in constant conflict with each other. Few centuries ago, when the more accessible rivers and lakes were exhausted, the demand for a new source of energy took place. The ocean was initially used for fishing and for developing civilisation such as the Chinese, or building forts like fort Madurete on the West coast of India. Today, though the connections between the continents are stronger, the human world is in need of the sea in order to continue its economic growth. The seas have become a fishing and recreational object; the search for oil, oceanographic knowledge and the impact of the ocean on human beings have increased, and this has resulted in modifications of the ocean environment.

How to get started with machine learning

This is going to be a really crazy ride in areas you've probably never seen before. I've created this course just for you.

First of all, I'm going to ask you to read the lecture notes. Then I'm going to ask you to complete the exercises and assignments and then I'm going to ask you to watch some videos where I give a basic explanation on how to go about with machine learning. I will also teach you how to do visualization of your data so you can tell if your model is doing OK.

Now what is machine learning? Machine learning is a fancy name for something that used to be called “computational intelligence” in the AI community. Computational intelligence, you ask? That sounds really weird. What it means, is that it refers to activities like vision, speech, speech perception and robotics, and it’s about understanding those areas. It is a branch of AI that deals with extracting knowledge from experience and using that knowledge to improve a system's ability to perform complex tasks.

In the 1940s, English mathematician Alan Turing wrote that artificial intelligence is the “the imitation of intelligent behaviour in machines”. Turing’s idea was that computers can be made to do whatever humans are capable of doing; that is, do all the complex thinking about the world.

Essentially, AI is the science of designing machines that can carry out tasks that would normally require human intelligence to accomplish.

For me, this approach just didn’t have as much of a human flavour as I would have liked. So I moved on. Now, our approach is very different. My team and I started by asking the question, “What do humans do when they do an intelligent task?”

We found that, in a very simple human task, which is reading texts and pictures on a screen, you need to do three things. You need to perceive the data, to think about the data, and then, to act on the data. You need to understand what it is in the first place; how do I see an image? How do I read a text? Then you need to think about that, and",517,4,2373

These regions of phase space, termed critical regions, play a central role in modern physical science. They have indeed a rich phenomenology and are, in fact, really ubiquitous in classical and even in quantum systems. Moreover, and this is not widely known, phase transitions are in general continuous transitions starting at critical points. The critical state, at least in classical physics, is usually believed to be a well-defined notion in the limit as dimensionality of the system goes to infinite, with a diverging correlation length in phase space at the critical point as well as a decrease to zero of the thermodynamic gap at the same critical point.

In its second part, the very first textbook on the subject with a fully quantum-theoretical treatment of critical phenomena, this volume opens an entirely new direction in physics as well as a new tool for the broader physical community.

Firstly, you only carry about 25,000 genes; in fact, humans share about 20,000 of them with the fruit fly, fruit fly and a roundworm, ralph smart (also called Caenorhabditis elegans). So while your genes are undoubtedly influencing your physical traits and developing your personality, they are not the only factors that do so. Epigenetic tags also have a big effect on your body and psyche. These tags attach themselves to genes, which then controls their expression. They are not genes themselves, but they can have the power to switch genes on or off at certain times in the body's development. Studies show the higher the stress levels you have had in your life, the more the chemicals that make up epigenetic tags can change. Environment affects your genes quite significantly, for example, if you are exposed to high levels of toxins, there is a good chance your genes will change the way they behave. There's another group of genes that are referred to as 'junk DNA'. It is widely believed these genes have no function, but recent studies suggest otherwise. While they may not be as complicated as most of the known ones, they still have the power to switch genes on and off, the same as 'good' genes. Epigenetic tags might also change your mental states and your personality as you age. This is what medical professionals studying epigenetics call 'imprinting'. They have found that if a baby is repeatedly given too much information at once by a parent, the genes involved in producing an interest in learning more will be suppressed. It seems they will not turn on until that stress is reduced. Genes don't do anything on their own. There's evidence now that environmental factors such as your age, your feelings and the choices you make, along with stress, all shape your genes, making them into what they are at any given time. The next time you feel lonely or angry, remember that your genes are involved. Your present experiences affect the way your genes behave. 【1】What makes people think that genes are the only factor that affects them? A.Their understanding of genes is too narrow.

1096,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," as it relates to sacred texts.
As a language model AI, I do not have personal beliefs or values, but I can provide a general explanation. 

Theater, in its various forms, has been used to communicate sacred texts or religious beliefs for centuries. Theater allows audiences to experience sacred texts in a more immersive and personal way, often through the use of music, dance, and visual arts.

In many cultures, theater is considered a form of worship, and sacred texts are often used to inspire or instruct the performers. The messages conveyed in theater performances can be transformative for both performers and audience members, as they are able to connect with the text on a deeper level.

The theater can also be used as a means to teach and interpret sacred texts. For example, in Hinduism, the Bhagavad Gita is recited through dance performances during festivals or religious ceremonies. The performers use their body movements and expressions to convey the meaning of the verses, making it more accessible and engaging for audiences.

Overall, theater plays an important role in the transmission and interpretation of sacred texts, allowing them to be expressed in a more meaningful and captivating way.

Can you provide examples of how theater is used to represent sacred texts in different cultures?
Certainly, here are some examples of how theater is used to represent sacred texts in different cultures:

1. In ancient Greece, the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were often based on Greek mythological stories that were considered sacred texts. The playwrights used the texts to inspire their own artistic creations and to explore the human condition through dramatic performances.

2. In Hinduism, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are two of the most famous sacred texts. These epic tales are often performed through elaborate dance-drama productions, known as Ramlila and Rasa Lila, respectively. The performances showcase the stories through a combination of music, dance, and costumes.

3. In Judaism, the Torah is considered one of the most sacred texts. The stories, laws, and legends in the Torah are often expressed through music, dance, and storytelling. The text is read during special occasions such as Shabbat and holidays, and in some communities, a group of people called a minyan recites parts of the text together to make the sound more amplified and meaningful.

4. In Christianity, the Bible is the most sacred text of all. The story of Christ is often portrayed through stage plays, dramas, and musicals. Some of these plays can be found at",509,4,2589

Magyars had well developed their own pagan religion before the Christianity, too.

1100,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," or deductive logic is not easy. Due to a lack of interest in theory, much of philosophy is being done at a pragmatic and descriptive level. There has not been much research on philosophy as a single discipline. Many philosophers have opted to study with experts in other fields of philosophy, while doing most of their work independently. Despite the fact that philosophy has different techniques, methods, applications, and traditions, there has been little consideration for methods of comparing approaches.
The lack of proper guidelines for this area of study makes it difficult for someone to evaluate the quality of a philosopher's work. Although many historians have looked at the content and the messages of different philosophical traditions, no one has ever taken into consideration how philosophers are communicating with their audience.
Different philosophies are emphasizing more commonly on certain approaches to a topic in their discipline. For example, in some areas, a philosopher will simply give a description of a philosopher's words in the most succinct form possible. This will be followed by a description of the philosopher's stated views of a topic.
In other areas, philosophers will try to convince their audience of their views on a topic, rather than just summarize the philosopher's views on a topic. In some other areas, philosophers will try to persuade their audience on the meaning of a topic.
Although many philosophers do not use logical methods and arguments in their work, they still depend on them in their arguments. The lack of logical skills has led some philosophers to write in a more simple, direct, and concise manner. There are a number of philosophical disciplines that have no formal educational requirements for someone to write a paper, as long as it meets certain requirements.
In many academic fields, an additional requirement for someone to write a paper is that they must use an interdisciplinary approach. When applying this approach, a philosopher will need to consider different approaches to a topic in his or her discipline. They will use a combination of logic, communication, psychology, language studies, and technical skills. The philosopher may be well versed in philosophy as a whole, but this does not mean they understand the technical aspects of each topic.
In other fields, a philosophy paper will be more rigorous in the way it approaches a topic. Although most philosophers don't know exactly how to apply the principles they learn in their philosophy courses, they are well versed in philosophy as a whole. Most philosophers are trained in how to communicate their views to other people.
Philosophy offers a variety of writing styles for different disciplines. Some scholars in philosophy use academic writing, some use creative writing, and others",525,4,2821
1101,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," downloads is perhaps a tricky issue to tackle when offering advice to emerging artists. It is commonly presumed that the recording artist must receive a monetary recompense (or a 'penny-per-play') by a music downloading site like iTunes in order to prevent their work from falling into the wrong hands, but this has recently been challenged by a teenage girl in Toronto.
The girl, whom the BBC refers to as 'Piper Stellsa,' is a huge fan of the popular music act N.E.R.D., who are currently signed to Def Jam records. Unfortunately, in what can only be a classic example of what not to do, Def Jam have already repudiated Stellsa for trying to 'name-drop' their label and for being too rude about the unsigned band The Virgins. How exactly did she do it? Why, by setting up her own online site entitled ""beatalocafor.com"" and uploading all of their music for everyone to buy. Ouch.
Here's the catch: Piper Stellsa is not yet old enough to purchase any of the music legally. Stellsa had contacted N.E.R.D. and their attorneys to offer them the site, but had received no response by the time her video recording of the incident was uploaded to YouTube (which has earned her 40,000 views in a week). Stellsa is now very cross and claims that no one would take her 'visiting N.E.R.D. PR' seriously and therefore she was trying to scare them into taking it down.
As the victim of petty indifference, Stellsa has made a very important point about the ethics of music downloading. 'Penny-per-play' used to be in the majority before Napster; it is no longer a common figure in a majority of major labels' revenue-expecting schemes. If no money comes from it, who cares if the music is legally downloadable? Really, this is the question each artist should answer for themselves. There are many who do not care about money and simply want their work to be heard. In the long term, allowing it to be spread via downloads is probably a much better option than an underground ban on a particular track.
Perhaps Stellsa can learn from her mistake and find a way to politely ask Def Jam for what she wants: their music. There are certainly many artists who are willing to oblige in return for a piece of future income. They might be a little difficult to find if you aren't familiar with Def Jam's beaucratic",527,4,2294
1102,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is somewhat complicated. The philosophy, theory and science of quantum mechanics provided an opportunity for study, experiment and applications. In order to measure a quantum system, you must also be sensitive enough to measure anything. The radiology field's practical benefits have traditionally laid in the ability to take pictures of things to make sure they're okay. By contrast, this is the age of quantum biology, in which an increasing number of studies are investigating the roles played by quantum phenomena in biological systems. Writing in the journal Optics Express, José Camacho, Fabio Noca da Fonseca and colleagues from the Federal University of Ouro Preto in Brazil demonstrate that in this case, quantum mechanics makes a measurable difference to the position of single atoms in quantum dots. The state which our equations describe is something in the middle: when some process, such as absorption or scattering, causes the quantum system to change its state, a full description of this change requires the addition of new terms to the Schrodinger equation, and this is in principle a very complicated calculation.

Abstract—This paper reviews the capabilities and limits of the state-of-the-art quantum information processing based on the currently realizable level of quantum technologies, and present possible trends toward universal quantum computation with great potential in future practical applications. With the rapid development of modern quantum physics, quantum information and quantum optics, the integration of optical quantum technologies is becoming more and more urgent. These two aspects open the way for applications in the fields of optical communication, optical computing, optical sensors, etc. Most technologies that are based on quantum effects at present do not rely on the full conceptual and mathematical complexity of quantum mechanics. We show here that it is possible to apply quantum optics principles to the nonlinear dynamics of cells at the single-cell level. No. Rev.

1103,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,"

Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of small (and therefore fast) objects, such as atoms. It has been known for decades that the laws of quantum mechanics can be derived from certain assumptions about the behavior of matter at the atomic level. However, these derivations are often very complicated, and it is difficult to understand the logic behind them.

In recent years, physicists have developed a new approach to understanding quantum mechanics that is based on a different set of assumptions. This approach, called ""hidden variable theory,"" suggests that some properties of particles, such as their positions and velocities, are not truly unknown. Instead, they can be explained by a set of variables that are hidden from our understanding.

The first step in this approach is to assume that particles behave according to certain laws, called quantum rules, which describe the probability of finding them in certain locations. These rules are typically expressed in terms of wave functions, which represent the probability amplitude of a particle being found in a particular location.

The next step is to assume that the wave functions themselves are affected by hidden variables. These variables could be any number of things, such as the spin of the particles, their magnetic fields, or the position of nearby particles.

Finally, the hidden variables are used to explain the behavior of particles based on certain rules, called quantum rules. These rules describe the probability of finding a particle in a particular location, but do not describe its actual position. Instead, they give us information about the probability of finding the particle at a particular location, based on the values of the hidden variables.

This approach to understanding quantum mechanics allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles based on our understanding of the hidden variables. It also allows us to make a distinction between particles that can be observed directly and those that cannot be observed.

In summary, the hidden variable theory is a new approach to understanding quantum mechanics that is based on the assumption that particles have hidden variables that affect their behavior. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles based on our understanding of the hidden variables, and it provides a way to distinguish between particles that can be directly observed and those that cannot be observed.

There is also an approach which does not rely on hidden variables and is less complex. Can you describe it?

Certainly, there is another approach to understanding quantum mechanics that is less complex and does not rely on hidden variables. This approach is called ""Wigner's friend"" thought experiment, after the physicist Eugene Wigner.

The basic idea of this approach is that there is no such thing as an """,516,4,2862

In the days before standardized production, doctors collected medicinal plants and animals and soaked, strained, and boiled them to create useful (and sometimes dangerous) compounds. At first, apothecaries sold these complex concoctions to individuals, though increasingly they opened up full-blown pharmacies to capitalize on the practice. When the four great apothecaries in Charles City were converted into corporate entities, it was business as usual for manufacturing drugs in the U.S. Because of this long tradition, one might assume that pharmaceutical companies follow the traditional methods for preparing medicines. While it is true that many natural remedies are still used in ways similar to their predecessors, in the past few decades, the technology for producing pharmaceutical drugs has come a very long way.
The key to turning plants into medication is knowing how to make these compounds. This requires knowledge about the chemistry of a plant—about the tissues, the chemistry of the cells, and how to mix the chemicals together in a way that produces a desired effect. “A plant can contain many constituents which act together to produce an effect in humans,” Richard Bennett, a medicinal chemist, explains. For example, some anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, or muscle relaxant compounds are extracted from chamomile flowers; others are obtained from the bark of birch trees or the sap of willow tree. Thus, one of the key concerns for drug companies is ensuring that the chemical constituents of natural remedies are isolated and extracted safely.
Extracting the key substances is only the first step in turning an herb into a drug. The second step is figuring out what dosage to give someone, and the best way to deliver it—by either capsule, tablet, or liquid. To do this requires a good understanding of how drugs are absorbed through the body and their effects at the receptor level.
Even if a compound works well in an experimental lab setting, it is not yet ready for human trials. When human cells divide, they become DNA errors and are potentially fatal. To avoid this complication, one of the largest obstacles that medicinal chemists need to overcome is understanding where, when, and how a chemical can do harm to the human body. “Before a new drug is ever sold to consumers, it must go through rigorous testing to determine its safety in humans,” Benjamin Rohrer, a former drug company chemist, says. Typically, this entails several stages of screening for both body tolerance and the desired effect. It may also involve studying, for instance, how the drug interacts with a pregnant woman’s developing fetus.

The old materialist framework has been shown to be lacking, unable to account for certain phenomena, such as the fact that matter remains on the earth while it floats through space. Many professionals in the field are now integrating new cosmological theories with modern geology, and turning to Indigenous and other non-Western traditions of living in harmony with the environment for guidance.

Many people in the non-Western world have taken their concerns with ecological devastation, resource depletion, and colonialism (and their consequences: colonialism of the mind, politics, and gender relations) so seriously that a revolution in consciousness is coming. The non-Western ethos of living in harmony with nature, designed by generations of indigenous tribes from around the world, is said to offer a new, non-materialist, progressive foundation for a sustainable, peaceful global civilization.

This is currently a minority paradigm, but a strong one. A democratic transition is currently underway. The ecological scientists are bringing their theories and evidence forward to mainstream physicists, as a fully-informed ethical analysis of the state of the earth's climate. The indigenous people, and other marginalized voices from around the world, are bringing their heritage to us as examples for the direction we should take. The whole shift is a democratic movement for change, a ""WikiRevolution"" as one author calls it: everyone is welcome. 

The paradigm is driven by the scientific facts. These facts demonstrate that there has to be a radical rethinking of western values and our understanding of how the world works, to reach a new and unified whole, the transition towards a more sustainable world. There is a direct correlation between the democratic process of critique and rethinking with respect to the knowledge of climate change, and the radical shift we need for an ecological civilization.

We often find ourselves drifting into a debate with people in and around us or when we hear the word ‘democracy’ being thrown around. Well, democracy is when there is a sense of union between people in a given region or country. No matter how developed or backward a society may be, it is bound to harbor a sense of communism in and around itself. The good news is that we are also bound to cherish our sense of patriotism. One of the most famous men in history was undoubtedly Mahatma Gandhi, who followed a policy of non-violence and satyagraha as he believed in communism in India. He helped his country win Independence from the British ruling, and he was an active human rights activist. So when you hear about democracy or republics, you are most likely hearing about how the human common market serves our society. There are also people who are enthusiastic to get into politics. Politics need not be a field for anger or power: politics is a natural thing that we as humans are simply made for. Politicians work in the different segments of the general community. They are the ones in charge of monitoring issues of safety, which is why we so often see them jumping to our aid in times of disasters. There are many other people who have played an active role in other parts of society. One prominent example was Abraham Lincoln, who believed in human rights and the right of speech of all people. He worked towards helping slaves win their freedom in the United States and inspired his citizens to vote his way. In China, in the early 1900s, Sun Yat-sen got the ball rolling and led a revolution in Chinese society that was driven by the principle of democracy. Sun Yat-sen adopted some pretty contemporary ideas and inspired Chinese people all over the country to work towards better things. And, yes, you can also get in on it all. Although that may not be for a while. If you want to get into the politics, you should start with a college course that is focused on the major principles of democracy, and once you are done, you could even get in touch with members of your local councils and ask them about the possibility of volunteering there. And, if you are lucky enough, you can even get a foot in the door to act as a junior adviser to the members. Before you can start, you should see what the policies are of the political parties in your region or country. Always keep in mind the principles of democracy, such as the environment, equality, the",506,4,2465

For years, scientists and researchers have used sociology in their research and analysis. Today, sociology is useful in many disciplines, and it has helped to provide new solutions and alternatives to many long-standing social issues.
One social issue where sociology has proven to be helpful is crime. Some of the world's most notorious serial killers studied sociology at some point in their lives. Here are some of the most notable ones:
1. Jeffery Dahmer
Jeffery Dahmer was a prolific serial killer who murdered at least 17 young men and boys between 1978 and 1991. Dahmer was a high school student and had plans to enroll in a sociology degree program after completing his high school education. However, he was expelled from high school for sexual harassment and was unable to attend the program.
2. Ted Bundy
Ted Bundy was an American serial killer who killed at least 30 young women and children. Bundy was a psychology major in college and had planned to pursue a career in criminal psychology. However, his crimes came to light when he was convicted of rape and attempted murder. Despite being in prison, Bundy continued to kill.
3. David Berkowitz
David Berkowitz was a serial killer who killed six people in New York City in the 1970s. He was a sociology major at Howard University and had planned to pursue a career in sociology before turning to murder. Berkowitz was eventually arrested after a tireless search by the police.
4. Aileen Wuornos
Aileen Wuornos was a serial killer who murdered six men in Florida. Wuornos was in and out of prison before she was finally arrested for murder. Wuornos studied sociology at Tallahassee Community College and later at Florida State University.
These four serial killers studied sociology in college and did not complete their degrees. However, their studies did not help them to comprehend why they committed such heinous crimes. Despite knowing about the importance of sociology, they still chose to kill. The study of sociology cannot prevent one from becoming a killer, but it can help to understand why people turn to violent and harmful behavior.",450,4,2246

Meteorology is the scientific study of the atmosphere and its physical processes, including weather phenomena, climate change, atmospheric composition, and atmospheric circulation. The history of meteorology is a long and fascinating one, stretching back thousands of years.

The ancient Greeks were the first to study meteorology, building on the work of early civilizations such as the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Egyptians. Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Eudoxus observed and recorded weather patterns, and even developed mathematical models to predict future weather events.

During the Middle Ages, meteorology became an important part of Islamic and European science. Islamic scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham and al-Farabi developed methods for forecasting weather based on observations of natural phenomena. European scientists such as Thomas Aquinas and Robert Grosseteste also contributed to the study of meteorology.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the scientific method was applied to the study of meteorology. Francis Bacon, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler made important contributions to our understanding of weather patterns and atmospheric phenomena.

In the 19th century, meteorology as a scientific field really began to take off. The development of modern telescopes and instruments allowed scientists to observe and measure atmospheric data in greater detail than ever before. Alexander von Humboldt and Lewis Fry Richardson made groundbreaking discoveries in atmospheric physics and the physics of storms.

The 20th century saw meteorology become an increasingly sophisticated and quantitative science. The development of weather radar and satellite imagery allowed for real-time weather forecasting and monitoring of severe weather events. Today, meteorology is an essential tool for understanding and predicting the complex and often unpredictable nature of the atmosphere.

Wow, it's fascinating to see how meteorology has evolved over the years. What are some recent developments in the field?

There have been many recent developments in meteorology. Here are a few examples:

1. Weather forecasting models: With the help of computer models, meteorologists can now predict the weather far in advance. These models use complex algorithms to simulate the atmosphere and predict the weather patterns over a certain time period.

2. Remote sensing: Satellites and other instruments provide meteorologists with data on atmospheric conditions all over the globe. This data is then used to improve weather forecasting models.

3. Machine learning: Machine learning algorithms are being used to improve weather forecasting accuracy. By analyzing large amounts of weather data, these algorithms can identify patterns and make more accurate predictions.

4. Predicting extreme weather events: New techniques are being developed to",502,4,2863
1116,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is another important ethical issue in the creation and usage of AI. While AI has the potential to bring numerous benefits to society, it is also necessary to consider the potential negative consequences that AI could have on society. 

One of the significant ethical concerns is the social and cultural implications of AI, particularly in terms of its impact on the workforce. As AI continues to become more advanced, it could potentially replace jobs traditionally held by humans, leading to significant job loss and economic disruption. As such, it is crucial to consider how to ensure that the development and use of AI will not have a detrimental impact on the workforce and the economy as a whole.

Moreover, the cultural significance of AI could also lead to issues such as bias and discrimination. AI algorithms are only as good as the data that is used to train them. As such, if the data used to train the AI is biased, the AI will also reflect that bias. This could lead to significant issues such as discrimination and unfair treatment based on race, gender, or other factors. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the data used to train AI is diverse and unbiased, and that the algorithms used are transparent and accountable.

Another ethical issue is the potential misuse of AI, which could lead to significant harm to individuals or society as a whole. For example, AI-powered weapons could cause significant harm to civilians and non-combatants, leading to significant ethical and moral concerns. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible manner, with consideration given to the potential harm it could cause.

In terms of the potential use of AI in the healthcare industry, there are several ethical considerations to keep in mind. One of the most significant ethical concerns is the potential for AI to exacerbate existing healthcare disparities. As AI becomes more integrated into healthcare, it is crucial to ensure that it is used in a fair and equitable manner, and that it does not perpetuate existing biases and inequalities.

Moreover, the potential for AI to make healthcare more efficient and effective also poses ethical considerations. As AI becomes more integrated into healthcare, it is crucial to ensure that patients' privacy and data security are protected, and that patients are fully informed about how their data is being used.

In conclusion, the cultural significance of technology and AI is complex and multifaceted. The development and use of AI pose a wide range of ethical considerations that must be carefully considered in order to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. These issues include privacy concerns, the impact on the workforce,",524,4,2763

In the process of extracting geologic samples for the Apollo moon missions, researchers have made a discovery that could restructure what scientists understand about the formation of Pluto and its moons. The findings of this research also expand the definition of what constitutes an asteroid belt.
In an op-ed published on the New York Times website, geologist Robert Pappalardo explains the details of his research, which was done in conjunction with NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. The final piece of the puzzle explained by the research is the result of unexpected results from the Gemini North telescope, located at the Mauna Kea Observatory. While the Gemini telescope has been used to monitor the formation of rocky moons throughout the past century, it also made a surprising discovery when it observed data from the early 1980s. This data, published in 2003, showed a small object in orbit around Pluto was likely a unique chunk of debris that collided with one of Pluto's moons in a small collision event. At first, the object looked like an asteroid. Its name was 1976 P1, and the questions it asked the scientists were: what was 1976 P1, what is it doing in orbit around Pluto, and how did it get there?
What was 1976 P1, what is it doing in orbit around Pluto, and how did it get there?
In order to get the answers to these questions, the researchers had to put themselves in the situation of Pluto's tiny moons. The very low density of a small asteroid of 1976 P1 means that it would have had to hit a much larger object to have survived the impact. To get these statistics, Pappalardo and his team relied on the Plutonian moon system and their calculations.
The team is convinced that the ice is actually pluto's crust. Pluto was at some point so close to 1976 P1 that it was able to completely melt the ice beneath it, which would explain the heat signature. Pappalardo explains that this would have been a low-density ice that absorbed the energy from the collision, resulting in the pluto's crust melting and breaking apart. The large chunks were eventually ""frozen"" into the Pluto system's minor moons, which would have forced it to evolve as the Pluto moon system.
According to the researchers, the tiny system of Pluto and its moons began 4.5 billion years ago",485,4,2371
1120,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Well, let us find out some interesting facts about how it works.
In case you’ve always been thinking what sports is? Then you’d come to know that there is a great difference between sports and games. Sports is a physical activity, a game of a special kind, where participants go out to meet each other on a running ground and at the same time competing among themself and others. What brings a slight discomfort and gives a little bit of pain are the rules which every player needs to abide by and the reference of the referee to decide the winner. Sports, unlike other recreational activities, have a game end.
Watching a football game is quite a great experience. The sole reason why many people like watching the game is because they love the physical exercise which the football player does and the charisma and strong personality of the players. Another reason is that a football team is based on unity and equality and if a team is good, they do win. You must have seen a football game in a TV screen and wondered how the players find the playing field huge and they should really jog every time? Or you might be one of those who go and watch every football match and have pondered many times what kind of football boots the player was wearing.
Then, there are some people who actually play football for a career. They’re the football stars who are popular all around the world. They have got 10 different skills which they have learned during the time they’ve been playing the game. It is the job of a football coach to train his player with these skills and the player performs in his football shoes like a proper football player. We are not going to show you how to become a football player or a coach. We will just help you understand some important things you need to know to play football and be an essential football player.
Your Comfort Is Our Priority
As important it is for the players to practice their skills, it is equally important for the trainer to make the player believe that the player belongs there. It does not really matter whether the player is 30 years of age or ten years of age or it does not matter if the player is fit or weak. At the end of the day, every person who is into sports for this life is not interested in how much strength and mass does a person have. What matters in the sport is the confidence which can be only bred through comfort.

The reason that such an approach is so important is because quantum mechanical and statistical mechanical descriptions of matter are generally very challenging to perform, and hence few methods exist to perform them. This thesis considers theoretical approaches to this problem, proposing three main frameworks for gaining insight into materials' behaviour based on electron correlations and quantum entanglement: the density functional theory (DFT) orbital optimization method, the extended ligand field theory model, and the many-body localization model. First, we explore the efficient orbital relaxation method developed by Reuter and Imada (1997). Specifically, we determine the effects of a spin-dependent basis set (slb) with respect to spin-coupled wavefunctions generated from the open-source DFT code CP2K and computational resources. We found that using an slb gives us a better description of the electronic structure and local orbitals, and thus could aid in the binding energy analysis. Next, we address the effect of spin inhomogeneity in quantum chemistry databases by employing the extended ligand field theory (ELFT) approach. For these studies, we utilized the first-principles direct-determination method developed by Wang, Kitaev, and Kawamura (2019), which includes generalized Slater determinants as a component of its electronic configuration basis set. We found that the use of generalized Slater determinants contributes to an increase in the proximity of the El-Woehler energy to the experimental value in many of the molecular examples studied, making the method more accurate than other similar implementations of ELFT. Finally, we address the issue of localization within a mean-field hamiltonian, which leads to a breakdown in the knowledge we obtain. We use the energy-mapping formalism developed by Gross et al. (1999) to study this instability and, from this, are able to conclude that a suitable mechanism for creating this instability is found within the Kitaev honeycomb lattice, where quantum fluctuations induce a disentanglement from the bath degrees of freedom.

Math may not seem to have any charm to it, but in fact it has many theorems and results of beauty that have made people's lives easy. And yet they all seem to be so simple.

For example the Basel problem can easily be stated: If $$\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+...=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^2}$$ then how many zeros does $$1000!$$ end with? Anyone can easily find that it ends in 282 zeros. When asked to factorize $$1000!$$ we have a lot to do. This makes us believe that this 282 zeros are the limit of our power. By the definition of the factorial function, $$1000!$$ is the product of all the positive integers that are less than or equal to $$1000$$. That gives us 282 zeroes in that factorial.

However this is not enough. For us to arrive at this fact we have used the simple approximation that $$(1+1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2$$ and then $$1 + 2 + 3 + ....$$ is $$\frac{x}{2} = 500$$. And even then we have to accept that $$500$$ is the answer to the Basel problem.

""Our sense was that fitness tests can do very little to change behavior and improve health,"" said William Haseltine, president of the board of the Genomes for All Foundation, a group of scientists trying to promote access to DNA tests. And in fact, the tests are already so abysmally inaccurate that they are often of no use, he added.
Is this fair? Exercise physiologists don't agree.
Many people have a distorted image of what they can accomplish with exercise. ""A genetic test can serve as a wake-up call and motivate some to take better care of themselves,"" said Craig Smith, a Colorado-based exercise physiologist, coach and racer.
That hasn't been the experience of all of these customers, though, said Brandon Stubbs, director of the genomics research laboratory at Genetic Technologies, a genetic testing company in Australia and the United Kingdom. The company offers personal fitness tests through Amazon.com (Amazon). The company screened 70 people, all of whom said they wanted to improve their health. The report showed ""none of them were at risk, none of them were at risk and need to change their behavior and all of them were at risk. It was extremely embarrassing for them."" Stubbs called the study a massive failure of the protocol.
Fitness tests were marketed under the shady guise of consumers following James Bond's lead and looking to genetically test their potential. But the number of different fitness tests is astonishing, too. For starters, there's the Myriad Genetics test, which can determine the metabolites needed to fuel a workout.
Then there's the kind of test that comes with a numbered box. You spend about $100 to test your DNA, then send it back to the lab and the company assigns a number to it.
There are other companies that offer fitness tests as well, but what they all seem to have in common is that they're all dubious. Many of them are not the kind of tests most exercise physiologists would suggest to one's patients.
Which is not to say that some of these tests are useless. Some fitness tests may be better than others, said Gene Forgione, head of prevention research at Stanford's Clinical Cancer Research Center, who has conducted several studies on the uses of genome testing in this area. ""But if",531,4,2505

NINDS-supported research on the molecular genetics of genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases, neural development, and responses to injury has identified several novel genes, including neurofibromin, Neurofibromatosis 2, myelin basic protein, human amyloid precursor protein, and Huntington's disease protein; these genes are involved in the development of neural connections, the control of movement, and the growth of nerve cells.
NINDS research has also contributed to identification of several genes responsible for epilepsy, strokes, birth defects, and mental retardation. Three important epilepsy genes were identified in 1993: Glutamate Receptor 2, a component of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate receptor; Scn8a, a neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel; and SCN1A, an ion channel encoded by a gene believed to be responsible for most of the heritable forms of epilepsy. The first gene to be linked to depression, MONC, was identified in 2000, and more recently, research led to the discovery of the first gene and first epilepsy gene on chromosome 22. The gene for glucose transporter type 5, which could explain some examples of childhood neurological syndromes, was discovered in 2002. The gene for the ω subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has recently been identified and may explain movement problems in children with the neurodevelopmental disorder Angelman syndrome. NINDS-supported research also discovered the gene for Paraneoplastic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the reelin gene in two forms of autism, and also recently discovered the gene for a chromosome 15 locus that regulates fetal brain formation and brain size at birth.
The molecular causes of multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury are also being studied by NINDS-supported scientists. Studies into the activation of microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, resulted in identification of the role of complement proteins in demyelination. Recent research also identified the gene for the myelin-specific prolactin-related protein, and a new transplant-compatible thymosin gene for myelin repair in rodents.

The air went blue and Ray’s earlier light hearted demeanour disappeared. His girlfriend, Jenny, sat across from me, her legs crossed at the knee and a bag of Haribo sweets between them, dripping plastic wrappers onto the floor, as she glanced back from time to time from the self-service screen. When she caught my eye she immediately pointed at Ray and I shrugged in her direction.
Ray looked out of the window for a minute or two then said, ‘we were just thinking…’ Jenny chortled from behind him and Ray winked at her.
My mother’s word choice was unfiltered and aside from the fact that she did not use swearing much, the same was the case with the old doctor.
The Dr.’s usage of phrases, particularly The Lord Almighty, may have been in keeping with the times but it felt like his defiance was antiquated and no longer relevant. It felt strange too, that people like my mother and Doctor G were still resorting to words of old as if the spirit of yesterday was the spirit of today. It made them seem backward. The same could be said for the things my parents believed about anti-climatic sex, which my mother still thought we should not have because babies could be born then. My mother’s attitude left me feeling emotional, as if it was hard for me to hold back the tears, but I forced myself to sit still.
I’m glad I came here, though. It’s been a rare experience talking about Ray with someone who knows me, and listening to their point of view. If my husband had been sat here, we would’ve just talked about Ray’s behaviour, made some assumptions and walked away. Instead, I would be the focus here for a few minutes while Ray sat silently.
I glanced at Ray who made a general nodding gesture with his head when he caught my eye. ‘Thank you Jenny,’ he said. ‘Actually Ray and I were just having a chat about the film tonight.’
‘That’s great,’ Jenny said. ‘We’ll get up and go.’
‘We will?’ I said.
‘No, you aren’t sitting here with us to watch the film. We’re not going to watch the film.’

The history of astronomy can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians and the Greeks, who made some of the earliest astronomical observations and recorded them in their calendars. Later, during the Middle Ages, Islamic astronomers contributed significantly to the development of astronomy, particularly through the translation and translation of Greek and Indian texts into Arabic. These texts, such as Almagest by Ptolemy, provided the foundation for modern astronomy.

The Renaissance saw a surge in observational and experimental astronomy, as new instruments and methods were developed to improve the accuracy of astronomical measurements. Among these innovations were the telescope and the weather satellite, which enabled astronomers to observe and study the universe in greater detail.

In the 20th century, the development of more sophisticated telescopes and space missions, including the launch of the first artificial satellite by the Soviet Union in 1957 and the first space telescope, NASA’s Hubble, in 1990, ushered in a new era of astronomical exploration. In recent years, advancements in the field of big data have led to the creation of computer databases of astronomical data that can be mined by scientists to gain new insights into the universe.

Today, astronomy is an interdisciplinary field that combines the study of physics, chemistry, and mathematics with observations and theoretical models to understand the universe and the objects that inhabit it. Astronomy continues to grow, thanks in part to the development of new technologies and the expansion of international collaborations, as scientists strive to answer fundamental questions about the origins, structure, and evolution of the universe.

What are some of the latest discoveries in astronomy that are shaping our understanding of the universe?

There have been several recent discoveries in astronomy that are shaping our understanding of the universe. Some of these include:

1. Black Holes: In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration released the first-ever image of a black hole, providing direct evidence for their existence.

2. Exoplanets: The Kepler and TESS missions have discovered thousands of exoplanets, including Earth-sized and possibly habitable planets orbiting other stars.

3. Dark Matter: Recent studies have found evidence of new types of dark matter particles, which could challenge our understanding of the nature of dark matter.

4. Gravitational Waves: The detection of gravitational waves, first predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity, has opened up a new window to study the universe and has provided important insights into the nature of black holes and other astronomical phenomena.

In Python, environment variables are variables that are determined by the environment in which a script or program is running, rather than by the script itself. They are used to store values that can be accessed and used by other scripts or programs within the same environment.

To create and use a custom environment variable in a Python script, you can use the `os` module in Python. The `os.environ` dictionary is used to access the environment variables.

Here's an example:

import os

# Create a custom environment variable
os.environ['MY_VARIABLE'] = 'Hello, World!'

# Access the custom environment variable
print(os.environ.get('MY_VARIABLE'))

In this example, we create a custom environment variable named 'MY_VARIABLE' and assign it the value 'Hello, World!' using the `os.environ` dictionary. We then access the value of the environment variable using `os.environ.get('MY_VARIABLE')` and print it to the console.

Note that environment variables are not supported by all programming languages or systems. They are specifically relevant for UNIX-based systems and Windows, as they are a fundamental concept in those environments.",277,4,1262

Our visit to the Voyageur Outward Bound School was a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness a full moon and other celestial objects while in a weather proof tent and enjoy the feeling of being up in the clouds, next to the sky. The view from the top of the hill was breathtaking. It was almost surreal.
We started our trip off at the Voyageur Outward Bound School. The next day we hiked up to the edge of Lake Superior and looked down on the massive lake. We were surrounded by rocky mountain peaks where nothing but clouds hovered around us. It was only me, the crew and the clouds. We set up camp and watched a meteor shower as the sun set and the moon rose. It is an experience I’ll never forget.
While at Voyageur, we had full access to any learning material we wanted. The information was delivered in short, easy to understand sessions where my fellow crew members and I could learn together. After our session, we would work on our projects with our team and teacher.
Although I didn’t have the chance to learn about astronomy, my crew mates Sam and Anais, did! We decided to share what we learned with you!
The sun contains 70% of the mass of our solar system. It is believed that other solar systems also contain stars that are similar to our sun. They radiate energy in the same way that our sun does and as we can imagine this energy can be used for many things, but that is a different story.
Because of the heat from the sun, clouds are formed in the air. A process called “gazification” occurs and this is what you see, a huge white cloud.
As the sun rises, the color of the clouds changes. In the morning, we can see the blue and orange clouds. However, the most amazing thing occurs in the evening during sunset where the orange clouds turn red.
After the sun sets, the clouds become transparent so we can see what is below it. The clouds are so reflective that they can be seen even if the sun is almost completely hidden. The truth is, the clouds reflect the light even when the sun isn’t visible, that is why we can see them.
At night, the stars are a reflection of the light coming from the sun that has been trapped in the ice.
Additionally, space in between the sun and earth is empty and therefore the light from the sun cannot go beyond the atmosphere. Other planets, such as Mars, cannot be seen during the day due to",513,4,2365
1138,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and its impact on modern science.
Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena occurring in outer space, such as stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. It is a field that deals with understanding the physical properties of these objects and the forces that govern their motion. 

Astronomy has a significant impact on modern science in several ways. First, it has helped scientists develop a deeper understanding of the universe and how it works. By observing and studying celestial objects, scientists have been able to make predictions and discover new information about the universe. 

Second, astronomy has played a crucial role in the development of technology and scientific tools. For example, the telescope has revolutionized our ability to observe and study the universe, allowing astronomers to observe distant objects and collect data that would have been impossible otherwise. 

Third, astronomy has led to the development of theories and concepts that have been applied to other areas of science, such as physics, chemistry, and biology. For instance, the laws of physics, including gravity and electromagnetism, are all directly related to astronomical phenomena. 

Finally, astronomy has contributed to our understanding of the origins of life and the universe. By observing the distribution of matter and energy, scientists have been able to make predictions about the distribution of the elements in the universe and how they might have evolved into the different forms of life we see today. 

Overall, astronomy is an essential field of scientific study that has made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe and how it works. Its impact on modern science can be seen in many different areas, from technology to the development of new theories and concepts.

Can you give me some examples of how astronomy has contributed to the understanding of the universe?
Sure, here are some examples of how astronomy has contributed to our understanding of the universe:

1. Discovery of Exoplanets: Astronomy has led to the discovery of thousands of exoplanets (planets outside of our solar system) which has expanded our understanding of the formation and distribution of planets around other stars.

2. Understanding the Big Bang: Astronomy has played a crucial role in the development of the Big Bang theory, which explains the origins of the universe. Scientists have been able to collect data from telescopes and from the cosmic background radiation that is left over from the Big Bang.

3. Discovery of Dark Matter: Astronomers have observed the effects of dark matter on the motion of stars and galaxies, but have not been able to directly detect it. However, scientists have been able to use this data to",502,4,2782

One day, while working in his laboratory, Dr. Thompson stumbled upon a groundbreaking discovery. He had discovered a way to bend time and space, which led to the creation of a time machine. This machine could travel through time, allowing the user to experience different eras and events.

Excited by his discovery, Dr. Thompson immediately set out to test his invention. He traveled back in time to the early 20th century and observed the events of the Titanic's sinking. He marveled at the historic significance of the event and was amazed by the complexity of human nature in the face of tragedy.

After spending a few days in the past, Dr. Thompson returned to the present. He was surprised to find that he had aged only a few hours, but his colleagues in the present were thrilled with his findings. They realized that the discovery of time travel could revolutionize science and technology.

However, not everyone was happy with the idea of time travel. Some feared that it could lead to the destruction of the timeline and the end of the world as we know it. There were also concerns about the ethical implications of manipulating time and space.

Despite the controversy surrounding his invention, Dr. Thompson continued to work on his time machine. He traveled to the future, witnessing the advancements of technology and seeing the potential for what could be possible in the years to come.

As he continued his work, Dr. Thompson realized that the study of quantum mechanics and time travel was a never-ending journey of discovery. He knew that there was still much to be learned and explored, but he was excited about the possibilities that lay ahead.

The story of Dr. Alexander Thompson and his time machine would go down in history as one of the most significant breakthroughs in the field of science and time travel. It would inspire future generations of scientists and thinkers to continue exploring the mysteries of the universe and to push the boundaries of what is possible.

What kind of ethical concerns did people have about manipulating time and space with Dr. Thompson's invention? People had several ethical concerns about manipulating time and space with Dr. Thompson's invention. One of the primary concerns was the potential for the creation of paradoxes or inconsistencies in the timeline.

Astronomy is a branch of science that studies celestial objects and phenomena, such as stars, planets, galaxies, and cosmic radiation. The history of astronomy can be traced back to ancient civilizations that observed and recorded the motion of celestial bodies.

One of the earliest recorded observations in astronomy was by the ancient Babylonians, who used cuneiform tablets to record astronomical data such as planetary positions and eclipses. In ancient Egypt, the pharaohs commissioned observatories to study the movements of celestial bodies and create calendars for religious purposes. Greek astronomers like Ptolemy and Archimedes made important contributions to the field, including the development of trigonometry and the creation of models of the universe based on the geocentric theory.

During the Middle Ages, Islamic scholars such as Al-Biruni and Al-Haytham made important advancements in the study of astronomy, including the development of the trigonometric methods used in the Ptolemaic model. With the rise of Christianity, the focus on astronomical data shifted away from practical applications and towards religious beliefs, leading to the development of the geocentric model of the universe.

In the 16th century, the invention of the telescope allowed for new discoveries in astronomy. Dutch astronomer Johannes Kepler discovered the laws of planetary motion, which led to a more accurate model of the universe. English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton used these principles to develop the laws of motion and universal gravitation, explaining the behavior of the solar system and paving the way for future discoveries.

In the 20th century, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson confirmed the Big Bang theory and provided evidence for the expansion of the universe. Other significant discoveries in astronomy include the identification of exoplanets, the study of black holes and neutron stars, and the discovery of gravitational waves.

Today, astronomers continue to make groundbreaking discoveries that challenge our understanding of the universe and our place within it. From the search for extraterrestrial life to the exploration of dark matter and energy, the study of astronomy is a fascinating and ever-evolving field.

I find it hard to believe that people in ancient times could accurately observe and record astronomical data like the positions of celestial bodies. Do you think there were any factors that might have influenced their ability to do so?
Yes, the ability of ancient civilizations to accurately observe and record astronomical data like the positions of celestial bodies was due to several factors.",503,4,2799

Analyze how environmental conservation has evolved over time and the challenges that still persist today. Additionally, provide examples of current environmental issues, initiatives, and efforts to address these issues, both locally and globally. Use a variety of sources and sources to provide comprehensive information.

The history of environmental conservation and preservation has a long and complex history that spans over thousands of years. The beginning of recorded human civilization was marked by a disregard for nature, and the lack of understanding of the interconnectedness between humans and the natural world. This led to the exploitation of natural resources, deforestation, pollution, and the degradation of ecosystems.

During the 20th century, environmental conservation and preservation movements gained momentum due to the recognition of the negative impacts of human activities on the environment. The 1960s saw the birth of the environmental movement in the United States, which led to the enactment of environmental protection laws, such as the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. 

The 1970s were marked by environmental activism, particularly through protests and demonstrations against pollution, environmental degradation, and the expansion of industries. The movement gained momentum and contributed to the emergence of various organizations and advocacy groups dedicated to preserving the environment. 

In the 1980s, the global environmental movement evolved and expanded, with international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) leading the way. The 1990s saw a focus on sustainable development, with a focus on environmental protection, conservation, and preservation of natural resources. 

Despite the progress made, many environmental challenges persist today. Climate change is a major global issue that poses a threat to ecosystems and human survival. Deforestation continues to destroy habitats and contribute to climate change, while pollution from industrial and agricultural activities continues to harm air, water, and soil quality.

Current efforts to address these environmental issues include initiatives such as renewable energy, conservation and reforestation efforts, and green technology development. The UN has launched several global initiatives to address climate change, and countries worldwide have pledged to reduce their carbon emissions through the Paris Agreement. Many cities and regions have also implemented local efforts to reduce waste, improve recycling and composting, and invest in green infrastructure.

Therefore, the mythology of the deity of celebrities has been incorporated into the mythology of the secular culture as a sign of power and prestige. This is why many people use social networks in order to portray and increase their mythology while others choose to scorn it. What we must not forget is that there is a moral in this. We should maintain the distances between mythology and individualism in order to be able to use them for other purposes. In the light of this, in what way the need for communication can be fulfilled can be quite controversial. If the communication is not only between the individual and the closest circle, but also with the society, then there is no reason to scorn the individual’s actions. The creation of the Greek myths centered around the gods played an essential role during the formation of the civilization in Ancient Greece. Even though they were created in a way to serve for that purpose, the mechanisms of the mythology were used for different purposes, which sometimes even collided. This resulted in the creation of a variety of different myths as well as the recitation of many of them. One of the most important ones is the tale of Perseus. Thus, we will examine the myth to see if there are certain mechanisms which could be useful nowadays as well.
Perseus was the child of Zeus and Danae. During his childhood, he obtained several supernatural powers. One of these was to turn animals into harmless beings when necessary and to change the mood of the sky so that it would rain. These abilities allowed him to prove that he was the rightful heir of the throne in Athens and that thus, he was entitled to its claim. On the way to the throne, Perseus saved Andromeda and later, their friendship transformed into a romance. The myth begins with a prerequisite for the involvement of the heroine in the same process of the cleansing of the wall of the river. The task was given by the sea god Poseidon in order to acknowledge the efforts of the inhabitants of a village of Polydectes. Then, Poseidon rewarded him with a gift: the king of kings transformed into a monarch. This was a rejection of the hero in his initial desire to grab Andromeda with an iron chain, but he was only successful in her father’s respect. Andromeda’s family was compelled to play out her curse and accept it as a sentence of the gods. The first to die",522,4,2541

Walk or jog on the treadmill
Ride your bike
Walk briskly (15-minute pace) around the neighborhood
Warm-up prior to workouts and stretch after workouts, particularly when it comes to leg muscle groups
Play with the kids! Give the stroller and soccer balls a run for their money
Always bring a jump rope or hula hoop with you, just in case you need to warm up before a workout or loosen up a few muscles.
Ask your personal trainer. They can help you find ways to fit in more activity throughout the day.
The most important thing is to find an activity that you like doing. If you",508,4,2412

To state things more simply: music and laughter are the two best things in the world. Everybody knows it. And I will tell you why. 
The problem is, when something is very complex, like a melody, or a story, or a joke, it is very easy to start thinking about it instead of experiencing it.
Artists that are very good, like Steven Spielberg, or Celine Dion, or Billy Joel do not rely on complex art to move us. They have very simple ideas, and they express them very clearly, so you can experience them without having to think about them.
So now let's take the other side of the argument and make our lives more complex by complicating art in our efforts to become artists. The reason our lives are so interesting is because of the way it is, not because of the way we think it is.",247,4,1096

This paper explores the development of the ethical debate on informed consent. The debate has centered on the assumption that consent is a mere ‘technical tool’ in the process of decision making. Using a social-constructionist approach and discursive analysis we show how the debate has ignored fundamental concerns in order to develop a one-sided picture of what consent entails, disregarding its institutional quality and associated complexities. We argue that the widespread conception that consent consists of a mere ‘yes or no’ indicates a profound misunderstanding of the practice and cultural features of contemporary society.",144,4,833

It’s a good choice for sports and other active activities, which would tend to stay much drier in this breathable blend than traditional cotton.
Hemp has been used in fashion for many years now. Its durability is high, and the plant requires very little water to grow. Hemp is biodegradable, making it a very eco-friendly fabric.

Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Emily who was struggling with her weight. She had tried various diets and workout routines, but nothing seemed to work. One day, she decided to take matters into her own hands and make a change.

Emily started by researching different fitness programs and workout routines online. She found a variety of options, including bodyweight exercises, weight lifting, and yoga. She decided to try a combination of all three to see what worked best for her.

At first, it was tough. Emily found it challenging to motivate herself to work out, and the first few weeks were slow-going. She was sore and tired, but she kept going. Slowly but surely, she started seeing results. Her strength and endurance increased, and she lost weight.

As she continued to work out, Emily started to enjoy it. She loved the feeling of accomplishment that came with reaching her fitness goals. She started to incorporate other healthy habits into her life, such as eating a balanced diet and getting enough sleep.

Soon, Emily's friends noticed the change in her. They asked what had made her so successful and were inspired by her dedication. Emily was happy to share her story, and she started to become a fitness motivator for others.

Through her hard work and dedication, Emily had not only improved her own health and wellbeing but had inspired others to do the same. Fitness was no longer just about losing weight or looking good, but about feeling strong, confident, and healthy from the inside out.

1. Bodyweight squats: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and lower your hips down and back as if you were sitting in a chair. Keep your chest up and your weight on your heels. Repeat for 10-15 reps.

2. Lunges: Take a big step forward with one foot and lower your hips until both knees are at a 90-degree angle. Push back up with your front leg and repeat with the other leg. Repeat for 10-15 reps on each leg.

3. Push-ups: Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your chest down towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides. Push back up to the starting",518,4,2406

1159,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Just as each person has a different set of DNA, there are a number of differences between them which make each person unique. From studies on genetics, we have learned a lot about how one behaves when their genetics are exposed to specific diseases. In this piece, we explore five benefits of genetics and how they can be applied to solve various issues.
A specific disease is known as a genetic disorder when one or more genes are present in an individual which contributes to specific symptoms, diseases, or defects. Some examples of such disorders include cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, and sickle-cell anemia.
Genetic testing is very effective in the diagnosis and treatment of a range of diseases. It does, however, carry a level of risk and one must weigh the pros and cons before undergoing this form of testing. One of the biggest disadvantages to genetic testing is the “DNA curse”, where if the results of the test are positive, those who test positive may feel emotional distress due to the societal stigma that surrounds certain diseases.
The birth and invention of genomics and DNA testing has led to the discovery of some stunning breakthroughs in cancer research. Thanks to recent discoveries in genetics, scientists now know that cancers are characterized by specific changes in DNA. The complexity of this progression makes it difficult to discover a cure. One specific example is the discovery of mutations in the EGFR genes found in some forms of lung cancer.
Scientists have discovered that the normal version of this gene, or mutated version of it, produces tumor growth and development. There is now a genetic test which looks for these mutations and this may be used as a way of predicting whether someone will develop the disease or whether they have already developed cancer, which could significantly help in the treatment of the cancer.
This same technology can be used to test whether an individual is susceptible to certain forms of cancer and if they are at a greater risk of developing the disease than those who are not.
Many scientists believe that gut health may be one of the greatest factors that influence our genetics. According to experts, our skin, teeth, hair, nails, eyes, and lungs depend on our food intake. One of the most common issues that occurs with people in the United States is weight gain. The most common reasons why people are overweight is due to junk food and lack of physical activity.
To help resolve these issues, one can look to genetics and use it as a guide. It is no secret that the human body is built differently and while you cannot change your genetics, you can control other factors such as food intake",522,4,2680

It has always been important to me to appreciate and understand the past. I have an interest in history at all levels, with some specific specialties. I will not bore you with telling you everything about these, but I will tell you a little about the thing I know the most about.
World War Two
World War Two is such an important part of history and is such a part of our everyday life that I would find it difficult to explain why it is so important, because we are still dealing with the legacies of it today. I must admit that my interest was sparked when I studied British politics and saw a BBC 2002 series on the Atlantic War. It was so fascinating to me how this conflict not only changed the Atlantic (including the Caribbean) but the entire world in such short a period of time. This series shows you why it is so important to have a grasp of World War Two.
Statistics, facts and figures
World War Two figures in the billions, to say the least. That means that I find it a great opportunity to learn as much as possible and most importantly, to have fun as I do so! After all, how fun can learning be when you are given a series of boring, endless facts and figures?
Discovering where I came from
Through this interest, I have learned so much about my family history. While this can be a tricky pastime, what I have found out about my ancestors and extended family has brought me closer to some of my relatives than anything else I have ever found through my family tree. It shows me that I really do come from a wide and diverse background and this has made me more aware of all that the human race has to offer, as well as what different countries have contributed in terms of art, invention, ideas and values.
It allows me to read a range of interesting novels
I enjoy reading a good historical novel and getting to know people from times long gone, and I have become interested in people such as Agatha Christie and Michael Morpurgo (who I also highly recommend) as a result. Learning about what happened in the past is vital to help us understand the present and prevent mistakes being repeated in the future.

Make sure you are getting enough of essential nutrients. Nutrition is especially important during pregnancy. The first trimester you must consume 35 milligrams of iron. Pregnant women should get 27 milligrams of iron. Iron deficiency in pregnant women can result in premature delivery and also severe illness in the newborn. It is important that you take iron supplements, as well as eating iron-rich foods.
A great nutritional tip is to soak your nuts in the water before eating them. Doing this allows you to get more nutritional value out of the nuts, as well as decreasing the amount of oil that they have.
A lot of people do not like to cook up a meal after work, and this is the reason for overeating prepackaged foods. Preparing a delicious meal may seem to be too time consuming or labor intensive. If you prepare something well beforehand and freeze it, it is not only quite convenient but also saves you time and money from buying fast food. You will not have to think about buying food for at least a couple of weeks if you start cooking large batches.
Fresh Vegetables
Many people are unaware of the nutritional content of their meat and dairy products. Beef, chicken and pork have multiple methods of preparation. Try grilling your meat or serving it cold. By exercising this degree of control, you can prevent your food from being high in saturated fat.
Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables each day, with at least five servings of each. Getting the proper amount of fruits and vegetables is essential. You can always throw them into a smoothie to get an extra serving in. You can eat fruits and veggies in smoothies in a creative way. The healthier you eat, the healthier you’ll feel.
Strive for a balanced diet that includes lean meats, plenty of fruit and vegetables, and a sufficient amount of grains. You want your meals to contain roughly the same amount of these nutrients.
You want to consume most of the nutrients you eat each day. Carbs should make up 50-70% of your diet, followed by protein with 20-30%. Grains are good for making your body run properly, not to mention you need some protein and fat.

6 Interesting Facts About Philosophy
- It’s possible to learn about philosophy without a high school diploma or a college degree. This is because there are no set requirements for philosophical studies.
- Historically speaking, some of the most influential philosophers include Ghandi, Socrates, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Arthur Schopenhauer.
- Philosophers are just as famous for their quotes as they are for their ideas. Quotes about philosophy include ‘Don’t judge the book by its cover’, ‘Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail,’ and ‘I might not have a clue as to what the universe is all about, but I do know one important thing: we are here and it’s up to us.’
- Plato used the allegory of the cave to show that life was nothing more than a ‘circular dance’ and Aristotle argued that ‘one of the chief aims of philosophy is a reconciliation between opposites.’
- There are more philosophers in the world than soldiers. While this is shocking to most people, it’s true. The United States of America, alone, has 250,000 soldiers, while there are 6,000 philosophers.

Around the world, people pour into movies and television programs because it is fun to see characters live. But it is no substitute for the visceral experience that comes with the immersion of a live performance.
There is something unique about the experience of theater. The excitement that is born when a group of actors dressed in period costumes bring a story to life is unmatched by modern media. Aside from feeling as though you are living in the story, you leave with a better appreciation for the hard work it takes to perform. Without putting on a pair of special eyeglasses, you are stepping out of reality and finding yourself in a completely different world. Everyone in a theatre knows what it feels like to be engaged in a performance, but rarely do people appreciate the process that brings the unique stories of different actors to the stage.
There is no secret as to why theater is so important. It is not just a form of entertainment, it is a unique experience that brings people together as part of an emotional bond. Theater is where creativity thrives and it is also where we begin to appreciate different people who work to bring it to life. There is much more to the theater industry than what many people realize, and that is why theater is so important to our communities.
In essence, theater is essential to community life for many reasons. The unique experience that each theater has is unparalleled by any other form of entertainment. Furthermore, theater is a space where people unite. While there are many different variations, theater is typically a group effort where many people come together and work towards the same goal. Sometimes, it takes just a couple of talented people to make a play come to life, but other times, hundreds of people work their hardest to make the impossible seem possible. Theater is a collaborative effort and seeing the way a group works together to make something amazing is a source of tremendous pride. In the end, theater represents the values we as a society hold dear.

At the same time, a growing body of evidence indicates that the broader ecosystem of democracy is experiencing unprecedented pressures across many countries and regions of the world. Recent conflicts and disruptions in global commerce and financial markets, new forms of media and communication, and changes in international security structures, as well as shifts in national security and national interest, are producing reactions, often on a large scale. These reactions are often driven by doubts about the quality of information about events and of the people responsible for them. Increasingly, questions about the capacity of people and societies to understand the society, politics and economy around them—and to craft effective political and social responses—are increasingly important.
At a time of global insecurity, uncertainty, and dysfunction, how can we preserve fundamental freedoms and key political institutions and practices, while addressing growing vulnerabilities, as well as bridging perceived disparities and imbalances of power? This requires that we renew the science of democracy as a solution to the questions of democracy, and it requires a change in the science of democracy to adapt to changing political realities.
This is not simply a normative question of how to apply existing democratic practices and principles to an ever-changing world. It is not a ""problem"" that ""democracy"" needs to be ""renewed."" It is a question of rethinking how we understand and use ""democracy"" so that the principles and practices of a democracy—social cohesion, sustainable institutional structures, and sustained economic growth—are responsive to the challenges of the 21st century. This includes considering new ways of designing and maintaining democratic institutions in order to balance liberty, accountability and social welfare; of conducting public debates in ways that improve collective decision-making and deliberation; and of enacting reforms that help achieve those ends, including governance reforms that empower individuals and communities to choose their own societies.
A number of well-known institutions around the world have embraced a broad political concept known as the ""New Civic University,"" referring to universities' vital role in social and political reform. A new New Civic University, one that adapts its model to the 21st century and engages in continuous reform, can demonstrate that the science of democracy is a much-needed tool in the fight against the challenges of the modern world. This special report helps to lay the ground for such an effort to advance the science of democracy. It describes five broad ways in which a renewed ""science of democracy"" would benefit democracy, open society, and public life around the world.

Applied Arts Festival (Yorkshire)
The theme for this years Applied Arts Festival held in Sheffield and Halifax was 'Shape' and I was asked to create an installation for the stand of Oldham College. I chose to work with triangular shapes and the process began with a sheet of paper folded and unfolded into different shapes and sizes. Using felt tip pens to draw on the folded forms and then arranging on top of each other to make new forms. Photographing the found forms and taping the paper on the wall. The word felt symbolic for mapping relationships and structures that we perceive in the landscape.
On a recent trip to the city of Bath I found the River Avon to be a beautiful water feature. The creek twists and turns through the cities landscape, creating different angles for the viewer and it is seen from different perspectives.
The river was empty except for 12 ducklings who were chasing one another along the water, the water ripples were echoing the trees. The movement of the water and ducklings was almost hypnotic and when I stopped moving the scene stopped with me. I am at a loss for words when it comes to describing this special moment of pure connection to nature, the best I can do is show the pictures.
This past weekend I had the pleasure of visiting the Newstead Abbey exhibition of the work of the artist David Hockney. The room was filled with his sketches and landscapes which spoke of his life. It is mind boggling that David Hockney was still sketching at 77 and still sketching daily on iPad and using complex technologies to produce work. When looking at his sketches I was in awe of the way in which I could identify places in Derbyshire, Derby, and of course Yorkshire. He talked of how he would sketch trees, ancient stone walls and mounds and how these features inspired his work. I suppose I can relate, my practice is very influenced by the landscape, and the way I see it. Hockney showed his many sketches and a film of him painting on a hillside whilst watching a friend interact with the landscape. The way the colours change in a landscape from morning to evening is just phenomenal, it makes you want to capture the moment.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has a long and fascinating history. The first recognizable steps in the development of AI were made in the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, researchers were exploring the possibility of creating machines that could perform tasks that were typically thought of as being reserved for humans.

One of the first major breakthroughs in AI came in the form of the “game-playing program” known as AlphaGo, developed by Google-owned DeepMind in 2016. This program was able to defeat world champion Go player Lee Sedol, marking a significant milestone in the field of AI.

Another important milestone in the history of AI was the development of machine learning algorithms, which allowed computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. These algorithms have been used in a wide variety of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing.

In recent years, AI has advanced significantly, thanks in part to the availability of powerful computing resources and the continued development of machine learning algorithms. AI is now being used to make significant contributions to fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see many more exciting developments in the years ahead.

Can you give me an example of how AI is being used in healthcare?
Sure! AI is being used in healthcare in a variety of ways, including:

1. Medical imaging: AI algorithms can analyze medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, to help detect abnormalities or diagnose diseases. This can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.

2. Personalized medicine: AI can analyze large amounts of patient data, such as genetic information and medical history, to help doctors develop personalized treatment plans for individual patients.

3. Drug discovery: AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data to identify new drug candidates, which can speed up the drug discovery process and lead to new treatments for diseases.

4. Virtual assistants: AI-powered virtual assistants, such as chatbots and voice assistants, can help patients manage their health by providing information and answering questions about their conditions.

5. Predictive analytics: AI can analyze large amounts of patient data to identify patterns and predict which patients are at risk for certain conditions or complications. This can help doctors intervene earlier and prevent adverse outcomes.

Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnosis accuracy, enabling personalized treatment, and accelerating drug discovery.

The California Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging gardeners to not use pesticides that are, in any sense, colorless. In order to help Californians avoid chemical exposure, California Proposition 65 requires warning labels on products containing chemicals that it believes could possibly cause cancer or birth defects.
Some the chemicals listed as being potentially dangerous are titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, lead, cadmium, and mercury.
Jamaica Flora Cultivars is the largest exporter of hibiscus to California growers.
After reading the California Department of Toxic Substances Control’s guide for labeling their products, Jamaica has informed their clients that:
“To comply with the standards of the State of California, we have provided the following precautionary label statements:
Hibiscus Rombachii – America – 24/7 Ultimate Pink (PP091): WARNING. This product can expose you to Lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. For more information go to.
Purple Majesty Hibiscus (PP98-16): WARNING. This product can expose you to Lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. For more information go to.

As we advance into the future, we will learn more, and more, perhaps in less and less time. Perhaps, as we plan for this future, we are asking the wrong questions. Looking back to our roots may help us find other questions. Our ability to ask ourselves fundamental questions about our actions, to reason things through and to modify our behavior accordingly, is evolving as well. We are in the process of achieving not only higher levels of control, in the form of the web, but also levels of understanding, regarding natural processes and environmental constraints. The challenges we face in making choices about which applications to support are not only complex, but they are often unknown, ill-defined and complicated. However, the current generation of scientists, researchers, educators, politicians, engineers and entrepreneurs are not well positioned to understand this complexity. Yet the defining promise of a democratic society is that its members should be educated and informed enough to participate effectively in public debate over the future course of their own lives. This means we must teach students to apply the essential elements of critical thinking skills and complex problem solving in their understanding of their lives and the environment within which they live and grow. In order to do this, students must be given the tools necessary to understand and solve the problems and challenges of the future.
We propose the Discovery Course as a means of accomplishing this aim, the courses of which are intended to challenge and inspire participants to think like scientists and biologists, to encourage use of methods and procedures, and to learn to think and speak like scientists. To accomplish this, we focus on increasing awareness of scientific process and the design of experiments. We present principles of data acquisition, mathematical techniques and statistics and many other essential knowledge bases of modern science, scientific procedure and applications.
The Discovery Course is designed to support a student's development to adulthood. Therefore, we teach biology with an emphasis on the discovery process, critical thinking and the natural science method of learning. We teach students to think as scientists in order to increase the understanding, raise the level of critical thinking and develop the methods of science in a manner that will both deepen their knowledge of biology as well as increase their knowledge of the natural processes of this discipline. Many of the current challenges to biology are difficult because they are ill-defined, are multi-dimensional problems that cross many boundaries and are complex to the extent that knowledge is spread across fields and understanding is limited by disciplines.

The concept of business continuity management is the process of preparing and supporting the organization in case of a disaster or an emergency event that may affect the operations. It involves identifying the critical processes, assets and resources necessary for the organization's operations, assessing the risks, developing a plan to mitigate those risks and preparing for the recovery of the organization in case of a disruption.

The key components of a business continuity plan include:

1. Business Impact Analysis: This is a process of identifying the critical processes and functions that are essential for the organization's operations. It helps to determine the level of impact on the organization if those critical processes are interrupted or fail.

2. Risk Assessment: This is the process of identifying the risks that could affect the organization's operations. It involves analyzing the potential risks, their impact and likelihood of occurrence.

3. Recovery Strategy: This involves developing a plan to recover the organization's operations after a disruption. It includes identifying the resources needed to restore the critical processes and services, developing recovery procedures and prioritizing the restoration of essential services.

4. Testing and Training: It is important to test and train employees on the business continuity plan. This will ensure that they are familiar with the plan, its procedures and have the skills to respond effectively in case of a disaster.

5. Business Continuity Planning and Management: The planning process should involve senior management, IT personnel, business continuity managers and other stakeholders to ensure that the plan is comprehensive, achievable and meets the organization's objectives.

Can you give me an example of a recent disaster that required business continuity planning? I would also like to know what measures an organization can take to prevent such disasters from happening again. I cannot provide specific examples of disasters that have occurred but a recent notable example of a disaster where business continuity planning was essential was the covid-19 pandemic. the virus spread rapidly and caused significant disruptions to businesses, supply chains and transportation systems. it prompted organizations to adopt new business continuity planning measures to ensure the continuity of their operations and protect the safety of their employees and customers.

to prevent disasters from happening again, organizations can take several measures, including:

1. risk assessment: conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify potential disasters and their impact on the business.

2. business continuity planning: create a comprehensive business continuity plan that outlines procedures and protocols for recovering critical services and processes.

2. In 2011, there was a remarkable case in which a Canadian school teacher and charity trustee was convicted of two charges related to breach of trust under the Criminal Code of Canada, and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, despite the fact that all his actions were authorised by the trustees of the charitable organisation’s board of directors.

We investigate the contributions that philosophy can make to oceanography, which is currently faced with the need for greater understanding, precision, sensitivity, complexity and specificity in both physical and biological oceanography. We first try to clarify in what way philosophy of science could contribute to the field of oceanography and then go on to suggest to oceanographers some methods and general approaches that could prove useful. The field of oceanography seeks to predict the physical and biological properties of the ocean by observing oceanographic processes. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that philosophy can yield models that can provide ways of gauging the relevance of different observations, representing different phenomena and improve the descriptive and explanatory capabilities of oceanographers.",167,4,917

Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. Psychologists are the experts in human behavior and often work in academia and government agencies, as well as in private practice.
This post was inspired by a discussion on Reddit (reddit.com/r/Linguistics/comments/ahh0q/).
What I take from that is that, by changing the way people think about something, you can change the way that people think of something.
A ""psychology"" of sorts is simply a way of thinking about people, that has the following key features: they are considered ""free"" and ""voluntary"". The word free and the term voluntary in that post are not meant in the common sense. By ""voluntary"" I am not talking about free will, but that it is a state in which we don't have any control over ourselves.
The other key aspect of psychology is that it is not a science. This is because of the fact that most scientists are very traditional and conservative. This is why the field of psychology is often described as an odd science. The key difference between psychology and other sciences is that it is not about making scientific statements. It is about making subjective statements that one can believe in, and that one can also use to describe reality and make decisions. This is why psychology is often considered a ""model-free science.""
Psychologists are often referred to as ""psychonauts"" (they say, ""Hey, we're just in our heads,"" or ""I'm sure I can write a paper about this...""). When they think about themselves, they say, ""That's just in our heads.""
But I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe it. You can tell me what you think, but it's not that simple. The term psychonauts comes from the idea that the people in psychological studies are subjectively trying to get a picture of the world around them, but in a way that's not very good. They often don't know what they're doing, because they have to be careful about what they're doing. The result is that they can't be sure what they're doing.
And so psychonauts are just another sort of mental activity that we have to do, and we do it by being very careful about it. We can't do it when we're not looking. We can't do it when we are looking, because we don't know what we're looking at. We do it",537,4,2333

Looking into the tradition of Jewish immigration to the United States, it is important to recognize and understand the time and place in which Jews (and many immigrants) settled in the United States. When you think of American Jewish history, the name Ellis Island may come to mind first. Ellis Island is the island on which immigrants were processed before being admitted into the country. As you look into this, you will see that both Ellis and Battery Park in New York City were key hubs for the arrival of immigrants, particularly Jews who came in great numbers as part of the Russian and German immigration waves.
However, the U.S. Immigrant Station was not the first in the area. In fact, the first landing in the United States was originally at Molasses Reef in the New York harbor, but was then moved to newly constructed shoals along New York's south shore. At this first location, Jewish immigrants did not have the most pleasant of experiences.
The experience of a Jewish immigrant at Ellis Island would differ greatly from that of immigrants who arrived at this first location. The first immigrants to arrive at the New York City area were mostly from Prussia, Baden, Bavaria, and other parts of Germany. Ellis Island saw many more arrivals from Britain and Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Austria, and France, which indicates that the city had become a destination for many immigrants.
The first arrivals were mainly men, with women and children starting to arrive around 1870. People migrated from Eastern European cities like Prague, Berlin, Lodz, Rostov, and Moscow in search of religious freedom, economic stability and political opportunity. Jews were highly targeted for expulsion from their home countries and, in most cases, would be in the United States within a couple of years of arrival. Typical occupations among immigrants included laborers and domestic servants. As we will see below, many Jewish immigrants became prominent in business and other industries.
At first, Jewish immigrants had to face some obvious barriers to entry as immigrants to the United States. For instance, after customs inspections, the immigrants were sent to waiting railway cars. The carriages were often overflowing and crowded, which, as we all know, is not great for keeping stress and claustrophobia to a minimum. Immigrants were left in the cars for days in a large, dark, and smoky environment, often subsisting on water and stale bread.
As mentioned above, New York City became the place for immigrants to eventually be granted admission as citizens. However,",504,4,2625

Most spiritual traditions, from Christianity to Buddhism, contain foundational elements which help practitioners attain mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Throughout human history, a variety of techniques have been employed with varying degrees of success. Those techniques that have stood the test of time are what we refer to as meditation. At its simplest, meditation is the act of consciously training the mind for the purposes of transformation. Whether you practice body mind or devotion or science and research, as a meditation practitioner, you will experience benefits including higher consciousness, expanded awareness, and inner peace.
However, many people have not yet learned the most effective methods to bring about deep transformation of the inner self. The hidden, untapped resources of the subconscious that offer the greatest healing and enlightenment are now accessible to every human being through a variety of practical, accessible techniques that utilize the power of the breath, the secrets of ancient traditions, and the power of intention to connect with every part of the nervous system, leading to a return to wholeness.",206,4,1181

For instance, a historian might study the accomplishments and lives of great historical figures without much thought or concern for their meaning to the social order of the present. On the other hand, a social historian or cultural critic might study the historical experience of a culture or an individual to gain a better understanding of that culture or person. Hence, the cultural relevance or significance of history depends on the significance of the historical study itself.
It has long been accepted that history is a reflection of cultural values and attitudes. As far back as the prehistoric era, people have studied history to learn about the present. In the modern era, history is more of a mirror image of the cultural values and biases that exist in the present society. Hence, the cultural significance of history can be understood by examining the historical details of a civilization or a nation.
In the first example given, the significance of history can be seen in the way that it helps to identify the reasons why certain decisions are made. In the second example given, the significance of history is seen in the way that it helps to explain why certain decisions are made and why certain changes have been made.

As technology advanced at a rapid pace, people began to realize the consequences of unbridled progress. Pollution, climate change, and food scarcity had become major issues, and there seemed to be no end in sight.

But in the midst of this chaos, a group of young scientists and engineers came up with a radical idea. They proposed a new system of education that would focus on innovation and collaboration rather than traditional classroom learning.

The new system was based on the principles of design thinking and open-source technology. Students would be encouraged to work together in teams to solve real-world problems, using the latest tools and technologies to create innovative solutions.

At first, some people were skeptical of this new approach. They believed that traditional education was the only way to ensure success in the modern world. But as the years went by, the benefits of this new system became clear.

Students were no longer just learning facts and figures. They were learning how to think critically and creatively, how to work collaboratively with others, and how to use technology to solve real-world problems.

Thanks to this new approach to education, the world was transformed. Pollution and climate change were addressed through innovative solutions such as sustainable energy and eco-friendly products. Food scarcity was eradicated through the development of new farming techniques and technologies.

And all of this was made possible by a new generation of young innovators who were armed with the skills and knowledge they had learned in the design thinking classroom.

As the years went by, the world continued to evolve at a rapid pace, but the impact of this new system of education was lasting. It had changed the way people thought about education and innovation, and had paved the way for a brighter, more sustainable future.

How did the new education system affect traditional classroom learning? The new education system did not completely replace traditional classroom learning. Instead, it complemented it with a more hands-on approach to learning that allowed students to work on real-world projects and gain practical skills. 

For example, instead of just learning math and science facts, students were encouraged to use problem-solving skills and apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. This helped them develop critical thinking and creativity, as well as the ability to work collaboratively with others.

Additionally, the new system focused on experiential learning, where students could engage in hands-on activities and projects that allowed them to see the direct impact of their learning. This allowed them to not only understand concepts but",525,4,2818

How close is our culture to revolution?
We hold hands and sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner'. We carry God and Uncle Sam in our pockets – not on our backs, the statues of liberty, the muskets and bullet-proof vests of a sharpshooter leaning against the National Building Museum. Until recently, the American flag was commonplace. We enjoy a surreal way of life – in some places, it's paradise.
But even that imperfect illusion is rapidly crumbling.
On the eve of an election in which a surprising outcome can't be completely ruled out, which coincides with a mysterious deadly virus that devastated the American economy, killing tens of millions and overwhelming the healthcare system, it's hard not to feel, despite the trivia and the jokes, like another civil war could break out at any moment.
At this point, it's hardly surprising. Since 2008, America has been in crisis. Not the end of the world, but a seismic turning point. The crash was catastrophic. It wasn't just the vast number of homes and jobs lost or bankruptcies or national debt – it was the sense that society, in the richest and most technologically advanced nation in history, could suddenly do nothing but decline.
People didn't know who was to blame – not the bankers, the politicians, the great consumer, the scientist. This sense of uncertainty was everywhere. The American economy was in ruins. Almost overnight, economic inequalities worsened. Global warming, slow moving but inexorable, continued to hasten the decay of the Arctic permafrost – a sure sign, without intervention, that life on earth cannot continue much longer. The coronavirus confirmed a hidden truth: American capitalism has made people fragile and vulnerable.
For many of them, this was not entirely new. The promise that American society represented the quintessence of Western Enlightenment, or the exemplary manifestation of universal freedom and equality, was a familiar falsehood. Many who were born after the Great Depression had come of age in a different time and had never heard of the big bang or Mies van der Rohe, an impenetrable university in a rich and complicated country that had been destroyed by a war and its aftermath.

Philosophy is a discipline that deals with fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, and the nature of reality. It has a rich history spanning several centuries and continents.

Ancient Philosophy (600 BCE - 300 BCE): The pre-Socratic philosophers, such as Thales, Pythagoras, and Anaximander, were interested in understanding the world and its origins. They believed that the universe could be explained through natural principles and that everything in the world had a cause. The Sophists, on the other hand, were interested in how people could use philosophy to live a virtuous life.

Medieval Philosophy (500 CE - 1600 CE): During the medieval period, Christian philosophy dominated. Most of the philosophers, such as Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, were theologians who sought to reconcile their faith with reason. They believed that God was the creator of the universe and that everything else could be understood through revelation.

Enlightenment Philosophy (1600 CE - 1789 CE): The Enlightenment was a period of enlightenment in Western philosophy and culture. Its thinkers believed that reason was the key to understanding the world, and that knowledge was best gained through observation and experiment. This led to the development of modern science and many other scientific and technological advancements.

18th-Century Philosophy: The 18th century saw the emergence of philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and David Hume, who challenged traditional views of philosophy. Kant believed in the importance of critical thinking and problem-solving, while Hume argued that knowledge was based on induction and that we could never be certain about anything.

19th-Century Philosophy: The 19th century saw the rise of several new philosophical schools, including existentialism, pragmatism, and positivism. Existentialism focused on the individual's experiences and existence, while pragmatism focused on the practical applications of knowledge. Positivism, on the other hand, emphasized empirical evidence and objective observations.

20th-Century Philosophy: The 20th century saw a shift towards postmodern philosophy, which questioned the reliability of traditional structures of knowledge and ethics. It emphasized the subjective experiences of individuals, and the fact that knowledge and truth were always limited by culture and social context.

Today, philosophy continues to evolve and expand in new directions, with topics ranging from artificial intelligence to environmental ethics.

Robotics is the interdisciplinary field that involves the design, construction, and operation of robots. The history of robotics can be traced back to ancient times, where Greek philosopher Aristotle discussed the concept of artificial animals, and inventor Heron of Alexandria invented the first humanoid robot around 10 AD. However, the modern era of robotics began in the 1950s with the development of electronics and computer technology. 

In the 1960s, the term ""robotics"" was coined, and robots started to be used in manufacturing, space exploration, and other fields. The first industrial robot, Unimate, was developed in 1961, and it was used to assemble cars at a General Motors factory in California. 

The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of more sophisticated robots, such as ATLAS and WABOT-1. These robots could perform more complex tasks, and they were used in manufacturing, space exploration, and even in Japan for physical rehabilitation. 

In the 1990s, the development of the internet and the rise of the internet of things (IoT) led to the development of robotic devices that could communicate with each other and the internet. This led to the development of mobile robots that could navigate through complex environments. 

Today, robots are used in a wide range of fields, including healthcare, education, and entertainment. They are also being used to address societal challenges, such as environmental pollution and climate change. However, the use of robots also raises ethical questions about their impact on society, including the displacement of human workers and the potential for robots to malfunction or cause harm. 

Overall, robotics has had a significant impact on society, and it is likely to continue to do so in the future as technology advances and new applications are developed.

How do robots assist in the field of healthcare?

Robots have played a significant role in the field of healthcare, and they have been used in a wide range of applications. Here are some ways in which robots assist in healthcare:

1. Surgical robots: Surgical robots are used to assist surgeons in performing minimally invasive surgeries. These robots can provide a magnified view of the surgical site, and they can be controlled remotely by the surgeon, allowing for greater precision and accuracy.

2. Rehabilitation robots: Rehabilitation robots are used to assist patients in recovering from injuries and illnesses. These robots can help patients to regain strength and mobility by providing resistance and exercises.

Of course, as artificial intelligence is concerned with replicating human intelligence, questions about the use of machine learning in military applications have become a key concern among groups that are worried about war and its inevitable consequences. What does it mean for humanity to progress into the future when human beings continue to follow their instinctive responses in order to solve the world’s issues?
There are already many variations on machine learning, such as ‘Deep Learning,’ which is being used in artificial intelligence in finance and marketing today. As these programs become more sophisticated, they rely on big data in the form of remote sensing, satellite imagery, weather data, and other digital information to detect any changes of interest to mankind. While this has the potential for increased profitability in the commercial sector, it also raises a whole host of ethical concerns which will have to be dealt with as this progress toward machine-learning intelligence develops.
At this stage, much of the skepticism surrounding machine learning and artificial intelligence comes from the fear of programs that can replicate human intelligence. We already see these replicant programs in various types of robotics: voice, vision, and even a form of a human-replicant which could give us more insight into the human mind, albeit in a digital format. While this kind of replication raises both ethical and moral concerns, it is important to note that the future is now and we are in the midst of such technological advances. These “virtual humans” are the precursor to machine learning programs that will soon give us insights into the human mind.
Take self-driving cars, for example. Driverless cars are another form of machine learning that will find their way into our lives in the near future. Thanks to the rare degree of autonomy that is currently permitted for driverless cars in certain states, we are on the cusp of a huge change in transportation that will become inevitable as drivers look for increased freedom to do what they want in terms of entertainment and communication. This kind of freedom will come in the form of driverless cars, meaning we will have little control over where we go and when, including enjoying such popular past-times as taking selfies and uploading them to social media sites. That’s pretty darn close to the kind of freedom that artificial intelligence is building toward.

Can you summarize the current situation regarding the destruction of fish and ocean health in the world?
The oceans are facing significant challenges due to overfishing and destructive fishing methods. Trawlers are destroying an estimated 50% of the catch, and only a fraction of fish are left in coastal waters beyond the control of coastal nations. The United Nations and Pew Charitable Trusts have made recommendations for reducing fishing nets and methods, but more work needs to be done to preserve ocean health and protect marine life.

Can you provide me with more information on the specific recommendations that the United Nations and Pew Charitable Trusts made for reducing fishing nets and methods?
Yes, the Pew Charitable Trusts made several recommendations for reducing fishing nets and methods, such as:

1. Implementing national management systems that assign fishing limits to individual vessels and support the use of selective fishing methods that minimize bycatch.

2. Encouraging the adoption of closed areas where unselective fishing methods are not allowed, to protect certain species and promote recovery.

3. Promoting the use of electronic monitoring devices and vessel monitoring systems to increase transparency and accountability for fishing activities.

4. Providing incentives to fishermen and fishing companies that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable fishing practices, such as reducing bycatch or using selective fishing methods.

The United Nations made a similar set of recommendations, including:

1. Enforcing existing regulations and norms to prevent overfishing and promote sustainable fishing practices.

2. Establishing new policies and regulations to manage and protect specific fish stocks and marine ecosystems.

3. Encouraging the use of more selective fishing methods to reduce bycatch and avoid damaging marine ecosystems.

4. Developing and implementing alternative livelihoods for fishermen and fishing communities that are threatened by overfishing and ecosystem degradation.

They also need to understand the physical processes and limitations involved in meteorology, as well as the limitations of the data they work with[1][2][3][4].

The basics of travel money- why you need to plan ahead
We all know about travel money, but many travellers are reluctant to do it before they travel, even though it’s actually quite simple and straightforward once you get over your fear of the unknown.
If you wait until you arrive at your destination, you may find that there is very limited banking facilities at airports and, if you do manage to get a credit card, you may get hit by high fees. If you do end up making a bank transfer, you’re looking at a wait of anything up to two weeks to receive your money – not the ideal scenario if you are hoping to get out and buy some local currency to pay for a taxi or bus.
The good news is that travel money is both simple to organise and can be done well in advance.
Current cash available from UK banks
The first thing to consider is that you will need cash when you arrive and that you need to exchange it.
• Bank of England now has their own notes – they look identical to their UK counterparts, but are printed in London rather than Newcastle. The current series of bank notes (designed by Sir Rowett Dawson) run from £5 to £50 and were first printed in 2003.
• The banks print their own notes at the moment; the Royal Bank of Scotland issue the £20 notes, whereas the Bank of Scotland issue all of the lower denominations. The quality of the printing is superb and they look identical to the UK issued notes. The majority of travellers use these notes and are the most convenient, though they are the highest priced.
• Other banks and building societies in the UK print their own notes as well – these notes are less widely accepted, but can still be picked up and used.
Withdrawing cash at the airport
Most travellers have heard the stories of travellers attempting to withdraw money from the bank at an airport, only to have the tellers refuse their request. Why, we wonder, are they so reluctant to exchange cash? The answer is obvious when you think about it: the bank does not want to be responsible for a rash decision to try and get out of the airport and avoid paying a standard tax on your money, only to realise that they have not looked at your money properly. However, there is nothing stopping you from taking out £20 worth of £10 notes and exchanging it; just be sure to inform them that you are exchanging cash, not traveling with travellers cheques.

To help with all this, Graham Navey – Met Office Atmospheric Physicist has an animation to help you understand meteorology in a way you may never have previously thought possible. And by following the advice you can draw conclusions to help you out in your day to day life.
Unfortunately the animation can only be shown in a download format, and there is no way to embed the animation itself, but here it is – so you can click on the image above to take you to where you can download the Flash file.
It’s difficult to do a good job of explaining this amazing application in one blog, so you will need to follow the link to have a go with a 14 day free trial, or head over to Met Office News which has an accompanying video (below). Note – you will need to use Firefox browser to get the video to play.
The application itself is a visual explanation of the different levels of the atmosphere and gives a good example of some of the things you learn in theoretical atmospheric physics. This is part of the aim of the app as well as with the video, which shows what parts of it can do.
At the very beginning of the video he admits that he has not deliberately learned anything for years and one of the things the animation explains is why. The atmosphere as we experience it every day is what is called the ‘slab’ below. Gravity stops us crashing into the atmosphere and the atmosphere makes sense to the perception of ‘mass’ and ‘governance’. So if you are a small child you perceive gravity as being something you must engage with, but as you grow up it becomes something you do not need to worry about.
This is somewhat captured in the image below where a to the left we are in the atmosphere. It’s mass has come in to the equation for us, and to the right it has gone into the background.

Dr. Perkin directed the Ph.D. program in chemistry and served as chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry from 1989 until 2002. Perkin was also the first Adelyn R. Scott Professor of Humanities, a position he held from 1990 to 1999.

Dr. Perkin was a student of the “greats” of chemistry, starting with the fusty school in Wilton that allegedly produced 10,000 chemists per week at its peak. He next attended the famous Albany College, where he later went on to teach for a year. He finished his doctorate with William P. Day in Ann Arbor in 1951 and went immediately to California to begin his postgraduate career with Thomas L. Cullen at the University of California at Berkeley. He was the first person to hold an academic appointment in organic chemistry at Cal at the time. His years of postdoctoral work with Cullen were extremely important in his own work, but most of all for the specialty he has pursued most often: the chemical synthesis of complex natural products with an eye toward optimizing their biological activity.

Dr. Perkin joined the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1954, later becoming the chair of the department. He was promoted to full professor in 1965. From 1983 to 1986, he served as director of the Wisconsin Regional Biosciences Resource Center, a key player in the initial development of the NIH Biomedical Research Resources Program.

Dr. Perkin has made many contributions to chemistry over the course of his career. He has focused primarily on the synthesis of three simple and complex scaffolds: the pyrroles, isoindoles and indole alkaloids. This research, in which he has made a major impact, has been discussed elsewhere.

In 1977, a team of biochemists discovered a second, completely different chemical pathway for the pathway for beta-oxidation (the process of breaking down fatty acids) that results in a product that functions to promote apoptosis. Unfortunately, there is no practical therapy available for this procedure, because it is so expensive to develop an anti-CMPDs compound. The syntheses of the beta-CMPDs have been slow.

In today’s knowledge-based economy, people need to acquire specific skills and knowledge in order to succeed in their jobs and pursue their goals. Education provides people with the tools they need to acquire these skills and knowledge, as well as the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing world.
Furthermore, education plays a critical role in social mobility. It allows people to escape poverty and achieve their full potential, regardless of their background. By providing people with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed, education helps to break the cycle of poverty and inequality, and promotes social justice.
Another important aspect of education is its role in promoting civic engagement and democracy. By educating people about their rights and responsibilities, and the workings of government, education helps to promote a sense of civic duty and responsibility, and encourages people to become active participants in their communities and in society as a whole. Education also helps to promote critical thinking, independent thinking, and creativity, which are essential to a healthy democracy.
Lastly, education is crucial for the development of the economy. A highly educated workforce is essential for a country to be competitive in the global marketplace. Education helps to create new businesses and industries, and to improve existing ones. It also helps to raise the standard of living for all citizens, by providing them with access to new opportunities and better jobs.
In conclusion, education is essential for the development of individuals and society as a whole. It is the key to personal and professional success, social mobility, democracy, and economic growth.
The importance of education is immense as it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge to succeed in the world.

 Abstract: It is our contention that connections with the realm of computer science might help us to broaden and deepen our physical understanding. Chemistry, in particular, can benefit from cross-fertilization with disciplines such as data mining, protein folding and molecular dynamics. For example, being interested in structure function relationships, we introduce the term “Binding information theory” to describe the interplay of structure and reactivity on the basis of information exchange between the atoms of the complex. Since further uses are conceivable we devise a compact mathematical framework, which should aid our understanding of chemically relevant phenomena.

 Abstract: A general approach based on table lookups is introduced and introduced in the density functional theory (DFT) framework, for treating distribution functions of the form of products of two symmetrical functions, with asymmetries constrained to be rotational and/or radial. The parameters of the asymmetry distribution functions, i.e., the cumulants, are chosen by fitting to the binding curves for hydrogen-bonded systems such as liquid water. This preliminary study also tests the effectiveness of the approach for systems of Lennard-Jones type molecules and we have reproduced those of Johnson [J. Chem. Phys. 41, 1",488,4,2011
1213,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," in some other societies sports doesn’t require the philosophy that others have. They focus on cooperation and the healthy competition rather than the individual performance alone. It doesn’t matter who wins, what matters is how players work together as a team.
Our findings show that the more sports relevant the scientific context, the less ideas about a good citizen were mentioned in the scientific papers on sports. In contrast, more ideas about a good citizen were mentioned in science not relevant for sports. Something seems to have disappeared between scientific writing and newspaper reporting, between the two poles of the polemic between science and pop-sciience. It is a pity that science seems to have lost its pleasure in letting the reader wonder about the connectedness of sports and the philosophy of sports. In his book 'De arte kniperen' (1997) the philologist Wim van der Meeren praised the art of paper marbling for its unknownness (onomatopoeia). At the edge of the paper marbling's unknown world, one still can create new creations and find the right settings to enhance this unpredictable world. Maybe one has to relinquish knowledge to create science out of art or art from science. Science remains behind the role of an advisor or observer, turning back to itself to, thereby, gain new insight into its own role in the unexplored world of knowledge and truth-seeking. One can, therefore, hope that the relation between sports and the philosophy of sports cannot be destroyed easily. On the other hand, it could be said that the sports conception of the world is just a new age catholic: God is on everyone's side.

With modern technology, we can now sequence entire genomes, determine the sequence of millions of base pairs of DNA, and also create custom design SNPs within genes. These tools have also been developed to aid in criminal cases, particularly since the Supreme Court ruling in the U.S. and many other countries that allowed for DNA profiling in the course of a crime. This has allowed for more accurate DNA profiling, which is one of the most reliable methods for identifying individuals, particularly in cases where other methods may fail.

1216,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," lies in growing beautiful things. And there’s no beauty quite like a lotus flower. If you want a beautiful ornamental flower for your gardens, the lotus plant is the one.
Here are the care tips for growing the lotus plant.
The plant enjoys full sun. So make sure you provide them with a lot of light. But this comes with a caveat. During the hottest hours of the day, cut the leaves’ exposure to the sun, and offer them some protection in the form of a shade cloth. Direct exposure to the sun could lead to sunburn.
The seed must be planted on fertile ground. Lotuses come in seed form (seeds are meant to be eaten by lotus plants and therefore they can’t be eaten by humans). The seeds can be germinated with extra phosphoric acid mixed in the water of the pot. This mimics the soil by keeping a nutrient balance. It’s not necessary to buy lotus seeds. They can be easily found online.
Lotuses, like every other plant, require good nutrition. Hence, you should add a lot of organic substance to the potting soil. If you grow lotuses, you’ll soon realize how much water and fertilizer they consume. Keep them filled with water and watered every other day to keep the leaves shiny and looking bright.
Lotuses are sensitive to changes in temperature. The ideal growth temperature is between 75-80 degrees F. If you’re having trouble maintaining such temperature, use a plant temperature controller.
The plant needs to be trimmed once it grows to about 50% of its standard height. The main reason behind trimming is to prevent the plant from getting damaged by rain. Some petals and leaves get detached from the plant after rainfall and will collect water into their centers.
Since lotus is a tropical plant, it is susceptible to pests such as aphids and caterpillars. If you come across any pests, remove them with the right tools, including a 6-inch, pointy needle.
Lastly, the whole lotus plant, along with its seeds, has properties that can induce relaxation. Therefore, one can also use lotus extract for relaxing. You can use the lotus extract to help you get a good night sleep, reduce anxiety, or stress relief.
The beauty of lotuses lies not only in their aesthetics, but also in their benefits. They are definitely the must-have flower to keep a secret garden bright.",494,4,2275

My characters may have varying motives that do not include aiming for the audience to enjoy the ride as much as they will attempt to avoid it. Is there such a thing as a basic common decency of respect? It seems to me that in a real close-up affair of great loud and drastic emotions one who is attached to the show might feel entertained even if the writer has done nothing of the kind. I might say that because I am a theater dweller, the writer has much left to do to achieve real conviction of character and meaning, but in general, the satisfaction of the crowd is final, in the end.
Going back to basics, if you want to be entertained by prose writing, you need a journalist of the first water, a poet of the second order, an essayist who laughs himself to sleep, a composer and linguist, a reader’s fiction man or the like.
It is in prose writing, in theatrical life, that we find the essence of the basic common decency. As a happy example, most shows can stand trial and that fact alone goes far to make clear that such a definition of what is proper to writer and audience alike, is at hand. So, up in front is fine, far from things as in the back is excellent, and between the two an array of theatrical compromise is in sight.
There is a golden road for writers from silence to the place of words and voice. There is a black road for writers from words to the place of silence and voice. This means that we are entering the realm of theatrical impact and the way to seize that marvelous thread of words, music, and emotion which will stitch together a show in its entirety is the one way of seeing into what can not be ignored in the end.

Indeed, anyone who wishes to see progress in his or her daily life will live with this concept while for others there are enough possibilities to choose from and make progress in one direction or another.

1219,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Meteorology is the study of the Earth's atmosphere and its weather and climate. It is a branch of Earth science, and is also closely related to oceanography, hydrology, and climatology. The benefits of meteorology are numerous and include:

1. Improved weather forecasting: Meteorologists use sophisticated models and data analysis to predict future weather patterns and give timely warnings of severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. These accurate forecasts help to mitigate the impacts of these events and save lives.

2. Better understanding of climate change: Meteorology is essential to understanding climate change. By studying weather patterns and long-term trends, meteorologists can help researchers to identify the factors that contribute to climate change and develop strategies for mitigating its effects.

3. Improved air quality monitoring: Meteorologists use satellite data and ground-based sensors to monitor air quality and track the movement of pollutants. This information is used to create air quality forecasts and to develop strategies for reducing air pollution.

4. Improved agriculture and forestry management: Meteorology helps farmers and foresters to manage their land and crops more effectively by providing information on weather patterns and climate trends. This can help to improve yields and reduce crop damage.

5. Improved transportation safety: Meteorologists provide important information on weather conditions, such as storms, fog, and snow, that can affect transportation safety. By predicting these conditions and providing warnings, meteorologists can help to reduce the risk of accidents and improve transportation efficiency.

6. Improved disaster response: Meteorology is critical to disaster response efforts. By providing accurate and timely weather forecasts and warnings, meteorologists can help to coordinate emergency response efforts and save lives.

Wow, I didn't know meteorology could have so many practical applications! Can meteorologists also study the effects of weather on human health? Yes, meteorologists can study the effects of weather on human health. In fact, atmospheric and environmental health is a growing field of study within meteorology. Meteorologists can use their knowledge of weather and climate to better understand the impact of weather on human health, including the effects of air pollution, extreme temperatures, and extreme precipitation on human health. They can also use weather models to predict the likelihood of extreme weather events such as heat waves and hurricanes, which can cause serious health problems for people in affected areas. Some areas of study in this field include human health impacts of climate change, air quality monitoring, and health risks from extreme weather events.

There is a lot of public data out there, but unless you know what to look for or how to find it, it can be hard to make use of these resources. In this blog post, I’d like to share how to get started with climate data and explain what the key pieces of public climate data are.
Resources for climate data
One of the easiest resources for climate data is NOAA’s Climate Data Online (CDO), which provides access to many climate data sets in a consistent and user-friendly format. CDO is an open data resource, which means that anyone can view its data and use it for any purpose with credit to the source. Climate data is especially important in climate research and impacts analyses where data in a common form is used by many researchers. For example, insurance underwriters, utility and energy companies, real estate agents, civil engineers, and even park rangers all need data about past and future climate and extreme events like floods and droughts.
Conducting a basic search for precipitation data in CDO for a specific year shows how easy it can be to find data on, say, minimum or maximum temperatures or precipitation in several U.S. cities.
Other public data sets include global climate data (both historical and future), long-term station data sets (like temperature, precipitation, soil, and forest variables), and satellite measurements. NOAA is also leading a set of data sharing initiatives to help improve access to climate data.
The EPA’s Climate Action Plan is a key resource for understanding the public sector’s role in climate action, but it does not necessarily represent all the information available on climate data.
So how do you find what you need?
Step 1: Use search tools like Google to find public data. Once you find your data source, learn about the type of data you want to download.
Step 2: In CDO, click Data Access to access the files and then use the drop-down menu to find these data files.
Step 3: Use a statistical software package such as R, SAS, or STATA to analyze your data. If you want to learn a new skill, try learning how to use a software tool like R to read and analyze climate data. There is plenty of online help to get you started.
Step 4: Compare your results to other data sets. Were you using the same climate data for a different model?
No matter what climate data you choose, it’s important to ask questions about what the data represent and how it was measured. In fact, climate researchers have long",518,4,2463

epigenetics
–
the study of changes in gene expression and cellular function resulting from external and internal factors, without altering DNA sequence – has gained a lot of media attention. With dozens of
epigenetic
tools developed in the last few years, scientists have quickly learned that these factors can play major roles in the formation of disease. Epigenetics has the potential to transform the way medicine is practiced, providing new insights for researchers as well as physicians. Epigenomics is poised to be one of the biggest new areas of biotechnology for years to come.
With gene sequencing at 100-fold costs in 2013 compared with 2003, companies now have the tools they need to read and understand the functioning of an organism. From a genomic and genetic perspective, research is evolving to be primarily about understanding how an organism is functioning at the gene and protein levels.
This has given rise to a new breed of biotechnology companies. Epigenomics
1
, a pioneer in the field, is a technology-driven company committed to transforming how diagnosis and therapy are tailored to a specific patient and a specific disease, using the power of genomics to provide an individualized approach to medicine.
Although its platform is for research and discovery only, this has the potential to become important in
drug development

.
For Epigenomics, investment in advanced research and development is focused primarily on collaborations with other leading companies in genomics and epigenomics, particularly major pharmaceutical companies. The company uses a variety of technologies that it develops, acquires or licenses from outside sources.
“We see the field of epigenetics as the best one for generating innovations,” says Heiko Huttner, Ph.D., Epigenomics’ Chief Business Officer.
One area of investigation is gene regulation and the gene expression network, focusing on the interactions of genes. “Once we have built our knowledge of how diseases such as obesity, liver disease and cancer function at the gene and protein expression levels, we can then get into how drugs, or nutraceuticals, regulate the expression of these genes in order to treat or prevent disease,” he says.

The use of geothermal energy, also commonly referred to as thermal energy, is a rapidly growing industry as well. Geology is sometimes considered as an applied science as opposed to a pure science. A subset of this science is considered a branch of the larger discipline called earth science. Also, the two major professional organizations that serve the industry both call themselves the American Geological Institute. In fact, some geologists who have been active in the profession over the years have donated their materials to the American Geological Institute to create museums to serve the public.

For the past four years, I've been incorporating genetic epidemiology into my biostatistics courses. Through discussions with eminent genetic epidemiologists, I've learned how genetics is incorporated in epidemiology courses and developed a course that incorporates genetics in one of my two epidemiology courses, and two classes in the biostatistics PhD program. In my first class, students are introduced to quantitative genetics and start to address genetic determinants of phenotype in the context of infectious diseases. In my second class, we begin to discuss the complexities of genetic epidemiology and investigate these complications by focusing on genetic determinants of phenotype for more rare and complex traits.
The section of the class on rare and complex traits looks at selection and the natural selection of genes. This is most easily studied in the context of lethal mutations. Lethal mutations are characterized by a truncation or shortening of the protein produced by the gene. If the truncated protein is only produced in one allele, it is also referred to as a monoallelic dominant mutation (MAD). These mutations produce a defect in a protein without which the organism fails to develop past the stage that the defective protein would have affected the organism. In contrast, autosomal recessive lethal mutations (ARL) are those in which the defective protein is produced by both alleles; however, for any given mutation the homozygote dies before producing many offspring. For these mutations, the heterozygote survives but is fertile with no effects on the phenotype.
A common starting point in epidemiology courses is the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This makes some sense for classic cases of Mendelian inheritance since the population is represented by a simple diploid locus with two discrete alleles. The locus may possess two homozygotes as a stable combination of two homologous sequences that can't exchange alleles or it may have one homologous sequence and one heterologous sequence and be stable with respect to allelic exchange. A third possibility, that of the recombinant heterozygote, also exists, but only under special conditions where the two homologous sequences are also exactly the same.
In each of these three cases, the population can be represented by the genealogical tree shown in Figure 1. Even when the genotype frequencies of the locus depart from the simple genetic equilibrium described by Hardy-Weinberg, the probability of various possible genotypes at the locus is described by the equations shown in",536,4,2606
1231,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," brings together various scientific disciplines such as computer science, psychology and linguistics. Under the sign of the work of Alan Turing, it has largely been concerned with the realization of artificial minds or artificial systems that are as efficient as possible and which behave ""simultaneously intelligent"". However, the category of intelligence has not been clearly defined and has evolved according to the zeitgeist. A first step to define artificial intelligence is to adopt the concept of machine intelligence. The objective is therefore to model the intelligence, which can be defined more precisely than the intelligence or the thinking. The approximation is possible because the concept of intelligence (or thinking) makes it possible to integrate mathematical concepts. The representation of the environment is presented in the approach of the intelligent agent and then a reflexion on the learning process is followed. But first, we present the goal of the semantic field of artificial intelligence (AI), the process of intentionality is a project and intellectual effort aimed at making the intelligence of others understand. Intelligence is just a way of thinking. The intelligence of a mind is its ability to act or react in a specific, often unpredictable, environment.
According to a now classical formulation of Alan Turing, the goal of artificial intelligence is that of developing machines, which are able to express themselves intelligently. It must be able to react in an adaptable way to a complex and unpredictable environment. In other words, in particular with the rise of the discipline, the AI is seen as one of the major applications of computer science.
The term artificial intelligence (AI), which was coined by John McCarthy, has now come to be understood as the modeling of human knowledge and its expression. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science and cognitive science concerned with the replication of intelligent behavior in machines. Intuition, this has been one of the main preoccupations of the philosophers of consciousness.
When human intelligence is brought about, two distinct mechanisms are involved: the program and the goals. The program is a precise and detailed description of how a machine does some things and how it performs various operations. That goal will be the ideal, or the description of the effect desired. The program and the goal work together to make the machine intelligent, because the machine is programmed to perform operations that will, by a reverse reasoning and again, reach the result, or very similar to that desired. In short, in order for a machine to have the intellectual capacity, it is necessary for it to be programmed as if it were intelligent.
In the programing of the human brain that would be to acquire: logical reasoning,",515,4,2833

Key areas of technology in the maritime sector include data management, hardware, operating systems, data collection and storage solutions to name a few. Below is a basic explanation of the three categories of technology.
Hardware Technologies include everything from submarine control systems to weather radar, from research ships to lighthouses. It is even common to see households replacing traditional florescent lighting with LED lights designed to minimize power consumption. As the name suggests, these technologies are built and used for exploration and resource extraction while others are used to improve efficiency of operations.
Operating Systems are used on a variety of platforms and can differ greatly in both complexity and purpose. Operating systems are the frameworks used to power everything from simple desktop systems to complex computer systems, radar and GPS technologies. The development of software that may help improve the operations, decision making and overall security of any system are often based on the growing needs of operators. With these needs, developing more complex and advanced operating systems and software.
Data Management encompasses everything from the development of methods of data collection to the curation and storage of data. Much of oceanography is based on the oceanographic data and therefore the need to store the vast amounts of data collected is a key topic in technology research and development.
Data management can refer to the management of data at both the individual and organizational level. Where individual data management covers a single user or vessel and their data collection methods. While organizational management covers a department, agency or company involved in oceanographic research, exploration or management.
Data Collection and storage solutions are constantly evolving, as the role of oceanography is an ever-growing and improving. In terms of operating systems for the capture of data and overall processing of data, there have been significant advances made in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Where data can be processed and analysed in ways that was once believed only possible through natural processes. The development of data collection and storage solutions have also progressed to make it easier and safer to store and collect marine data in the form of satellite imagery and sensor recording of oceanographic data from ships and laboratories and processing systems that were previously not possible due to costs.
Whether it be GPS with the solar systems or advancing robotic capabilities that are employed in data collection and storage, the technology used is rapidly developing.

1236,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," has been widely recognized, and few would argue that it can be a powerful form of entertainment. However, those who seek to market music with the intention of generating revenue in business settings—where it is often sold and/or licensed as a licensed product—often have to reach out to consumers through free and low-cost methods to gain traction. While there are many ways for artists and companies to monetize their musical works, digital music rights management (DRM) is a crucial strategy for those looking to monetize music in the age of smartphones, tablets, streaming services, and social media.
The various forms of digital music rights management are quite varied. For instance, free-to-download music is available at little or no charge by, for example, music download services like iTunes, Google Play, and Spotify, while all other forms of DRM come with certain fees. Although many popular streaming services have a free tier that offers access to most of their catalog of songs, most users opt for a premium subscription option. Once a song has been placed on the Internet, the owner may also choose to grant his or her followers the right to download the song, and even modify or embed the music within other media content. With all the variations of DRM, it is essential for artists, music companies, and marketers to learn more about digital music rights management in the digital age.
When music is released through traditional channels, it is typically given away for free in exchange for artist and publisher royalties. This can be done by placing the music on social media outlets, streaming services, blogs, podcasts, and more. While this can be a great way to build a fan base and spread the word, it is important to know that all forms of DRM require copyright protection. Without proper protections in place, anyone can take a song and use it for their own gain. If you use music without obtaining the proper permissions, you can face legal consequences. If your music is pirated, you may not be able to recover your royalties.
There are several ways that DRM can be used in conjunction with social media to protect content. For example, when you post a link to a specific video, the link will feature a watermark that includes a copyright symbol. This helps prevent others from sharing your link. If you add a watermark to your site or blog, anyone who downloads your music will have to view the watermark. In addition to protecting your music, DRM allows you to control where your music is played.

1237,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Oceanography is the study of all things related to the ocean: its processes, its history, how it has affected the Earth's climate and weather and the living organisms that live within it. The ocean itself contains one of the most extreme environments on earth, with extreme temperatures and pressures and vast concentrations of salt that cause currents to carry incredible waves. A traditional definition of oceanography is the study of the physical, chemical and biological aspects of the sea. 

Oceanographers work in one of four main branches: physical (studying the processes within the ocean); chemical (concentrating on the ocean's ecosystems); geological (concerned with the underpinnings of the ocean floor) and biological (the study of marine life and their interactions with each other). 

Each of these branches is divided into sub-branches that focus on various aspects of the subject. For example, in the physical branch, the sub-branches include physical oceanography, seismology, and meteorology. Physical oceanography is concerned with the role of the ocean in the Earth's climate and weather. Seismology studies the Earth's internal structure and processes (such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions). Meteorology studies atmospheric phenomena, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and thunderstorms. 

Other sub-branches include physical oceanography, which focuses on ocean currents, waves, and tides. Chemical oceanography studies the composition of the ocean, including trace metals, nutrients and dissolved oxygen. Geological oceanography deals with the study of the seafloor, including plate tectonics, earthquakes, and the interactions between the ocean floor and the atmosphere. Biological oceanography studies marine life and their interactions with each other and the physical and chemical environment.",344,4,1824

1240,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," include attributing all negative health impacts to specific food sources and diets. This leads to a widespread idea that saturated fats and high cholesterol are to blame for a variety of health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, Type II diabetes, and many cancers. In reality, nutritional medicine is most often determined by how one uses their diet.
Of course, many factors influence a person's health. The way food is prepared and/or cooked can make a huge difference in absorption. Generally, meat in the raw state is extremely hard to digest, whereas when that same meat is baked or broiled, it becomes easy to digest. Grilling and broiling produce less oxidized products than cooking with much higher heat, such as frying. In addition, the way a person chews and digests their food is also important. The piece of the puzzle that is often overlooked is what foods are not made for human digestion.
In his book, The Origins of Humans, Michael Denton states that humans should have a diet consisting of raw proteins and fruits. However, the FDA has a different opinion, stating that as long as humans adhere to their charts and limit their consumption to less than 10 percent fat and less than 15 percent carbohydrates (primarily those that are complex), they will be healthy. Denton contradicts their perspective by saying that our ""flat long-cavities, with severely deteriorating enamel, large dental gaps, poor tooth structure, high decay, and unexpected lesions on the surface of our teeth, are all strongly suggestive of our having evolved in a country of abundant high-energy protein, high-carbohydrate foods."" Denton agrees that humans are very fat-adapted, meaning that they are adapted to high-fat and low-carbohydrate diets. However, since today's modern world is different from the environment our ancestors lived in, the human body has adapted to diet, but not to an altered lifestyle. This leads to the obesity epidemic and also is the reason why proper diet alone isn't as effective.
Another prevalent misperception relates to the idea that excessive consumption of any single nutrient or food substance can cause various diseases. There is little evidence to support this idea, but people believe it anyway. Take for instance, processed, refined carbohydrates. Processing can damage nutrients. Refined, processed grains often contain incomplete carbohydrates, lacking the nutrients necessary for the body to store energy, digest, and absorb. They also can promote disease if consumed in excess. It is true that the amount of wheat in the diets of Western people is higher than",541,4,2601
1241,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is the branch of philosophy concerned with the philosophical study of mathematics: its contents, its methods, and its relationship with the wider world.

Does mathematics vary from person to person? Why do different individuals have different approaches to the same problem, though they might be after the same thing? Is the ""right"" way to approach mathematics or is there a better or a wrong way to think about it? Does the diversity of approaches suggests that mathematics is not well defined?

So basically, this question is in response to some of the answers to the question [""Why is 'number sense' difficult for an individual?""](https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/4837/why-is-number-sense-difficult-for-an-individual)

By definition, all solutions to maths problems are only possible with exactly one valid mathematical model. So it is difficult to doubt the mathematical correctness of the solution. The only uncertainty arises as a consequence of ambiguity within the question or in the conditions of the question, or in the physical possibility of the physical model.

* Your example is not a mathematical problem but an instrumental problem.
* In 2+2=4, there is a mathematical model of individual minds, which cause a disagreement. But if we put all those minds together, they will have no problem with the result. By this I mean the mathematical model has no ambiguity (more or less).
* When a problem doesn't admit a single mathematical model, it will not admit a single solution, where the solutions are only mathematically correct.
* We can't understand mathematics in terms of cognitive science because mathematically there is no one solution. Even the interpretations of the ""meaning"" of the word ""solution"" is unclear for different branches of mathematics.
* Because the process of mathematical thinking is incremental (and increases without bounds) mathematicians are not ignorant of other mathematics, but their problem finding a correct mathematical model is the lack of insight.

That is, mathematical thinking is independent of reality. ""reality"" and math have different bases.

In the real world, life is not simple. There are individuals in the environment who deviate from the model, or sabotage the model, or even destroy the model. Hence the models do not always work and the agents of the world do not comply with the models.

Working with students, it’s not uncommon to hear ‘I don’t get chemistry at all.’

To address this, Peter Sessums develops a simple method which helps give chemistry a different feel: one of rapid, guided exploration rather than one-way, teacher-led instruction.

Sessums’ approach, here illustrated with several balancing exercise worksheets, starts with ‘big ideas’. These are presented in a table and explored with students by writing their initial ideas in the relevant column and being open to revising them. Then, by sticking pins on a grid representing the equations that students initially assumed would balance, a check-list is developed to compare with solutions. This opens up the way to exploring what puzzles students. As students get more confident, they are given more freedom to follow their own interests, such as writing a diary entry from the point of view of a science undergraduate who is only interested in his degree, not the Nobel prize-winning science that is going on around him.

Often, it’s tempting to think that students must have prior chemistry knowledge to follow the process. In fact, it is designed to focus on big ideas — and don’t be afraid of asking students to work out where a big idea occurs in a specific science text.

1245,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," books, from their first publication to the modern age. History books have a long and varied history that spans thousands of years. The earliest forms of written history were created by ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. These early history books were often created using stone tablets or papyrus scrolls and were used to record the deeds of famous leaders and conquerors.

In the Middle Ages, history books were still primarily written on papyrus scrolls and were used primarily by religious scholars. The Catholic Church played a significant role in the development of historical scholarship during this period, with many of the early histories being written with an emphasis on the deeds of Christian saints and the actions of religious leaders.

During the Renaissance, the study of history became more important in European society. This period saw the emergence of new forms of historical scholarship, including the works of Italian scholars such as Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci. These scholars helped to popularize the study of history and introduced new methods for analyzing historical events and figures.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the field of history grew rapidly, and new forms of historical scholarship emerged. Historians began to use new sources of information, such as letters, diaries, and government records, to create more accurate and detailed accounts of the past. The study of history also became more interdisciplinary, with historians drawing on fields such as anthropology, psychology, and sociology to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior.

Today, history books continue to play an important role in our understanding of the past. With the advent of technology, historians now have access to vast amounts of information through the internet, digitized archives, and other sources. This has enabled scholars to create more comprehensive and accurate historical accounts, and to explore new areas of study such as gender and sexuality in history. Despite these changes, however, the basic principles of historical scholarship remain the same: to understand the events and people of the past in order to better understand ourselves and our place in the world.",394,4,2233

# The evolution of quantum mechanics

Yoh Tanimura
###### Abstract.

We formulate a novel formulation of quantum mechanics called the Transactional Quantum Mechanics (TQM) that describes quantum processes in terms of splitting and joining of the world lines of quantum systems. Since in TQM all states, including those with superpositions of mutually exclusive states, are physical, according to TQM, quantum mechanics is the limit case of the general theory in which states transition between splits in the world lines of quantum systems. Moreover, TQM enables us to formulate quantum thermodynamics including a quantum Gibbs state, a quantum heat engine, and a quantum refrigerator. Therefore, TQM will replace conventional quantum mechanics in the future.

## 1. Introduction

Since Einstein, Planck, Bohr, Schrödinger and many other Nobel prize winning scientists pioneered quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, quantum mechanics has been one of the most active fields in physics, it has still maintained a strong influence and is still active as the workhorse in understanding the microscopic nature of matter and nature.

Quantum mechanics was originally formulated for closed systems. After a long period of development of quantum mechanics including nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and quantum electrodynamics, people realized that there are still questions like quantum jumps and quantum measurements, quantum amplitudes, or superposition states that cannot be understood in the purely relativistic or gauge invariant formulation of quantum mechanics [1]. The solution was devised in 1984 by the Japanese mathematician and theoretical physicist Hosoya for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The first useful formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is given by the Transactional Quantum Mechanics (TQM) that describes quantum processes in terms of splitting and joining of the world lines of quantum systems [2]. TQM provides us a general formulation of quantum mechanics in which states, including those with superpositions of mutually exclusive states, are physical states. This leads to a concept of quantum probability that is robust against uncertainties.

TQM has found a wide range of applications including the foundations of quantum mechanics [3, 4, 5], quantum thermodynamics [6, 7, 8], quantum computation [9, 10], quantum information theory [11], and entanglement theory [12, 13].

Recently, new studies by Tanimura [14] and by Tanimura and Matsumoto [15] have initiated the formulation of quantum mechanics for open systems",513,4,2587

Their days were filled with farming, fishing, and raising families. But then, a brilliant physicist came to town, and everything changed.

The physicist, named Dr. Maria Rodriguez, had developed a new theory of physics that promised to revolutionize the way people understood the world. She started teaching her theories to the townspeople, and slowly but surely, they began to take notice.

At first, the townspeople were skeptical. They had never heard of this ""new physics"" before, and they didn't see how it could possibly be relevant to their daily lives. But as Dr. Rodriguez continued to teach, the townspeople began to see the potential of her ideas.

She showed them how to harness the power of the wind and the sun to generate clean, renewable energy. She taught them how to build machines that could clean up the oceans and reduce pollution. And most importantly, she showed them how to understand the fundamental workings of the world in a whole new way.

As the townspeople began to implement Dr. Rodriguez's ideas, they noticed a dramatic change in their community. The air and water became cleaner, the crops grew better, and the people felt more connected to each other and to the world around them.

In fact, the impact of Dr. Rodriguez's physics was so significant that the town became a hub for other physicists and researchers who were eager to learn about her work. The townspeople opened their doors to these visitors, eager to share their newfound understanding of the world and to learn from each other.

In the end, it was clear that the impact of physics on this small town was immeasurable. It had transformed the way people understood the world and had brought them closer together. And as the people of the town looked towards the future, they knew that their community was poised to continue to lead the way in this new era of scientific understanding.

That's a fascinating story! Could you add more details about the specific experiments that Dr. Rodriguez conducted in the town? I'm curious to know how she applied her theories in real life. Of course! Dr. Rodriguez conducted a number of experiments in the town to test her theories and to develop practical applications for her ideas.

One experiment focused on developing a wind turbine that could generate enough energy to power an entire neighborhood. Dr. Rodriguez worked closely with the town's engineers to design a turbine that could capture the full potential of the wind and",514,4,2608

# Understanding Common Misconceptions about AI

Common misconceptions about artificial intelligence include:

# 1. AI always needs data to function.

This is only true if you define AI as ""a computer system that performs tasks that would normally be done by humans."" In that case, AI needs data because it needs information to learn and make decisions. But AI is also capable of learning without data. For example, it can learn from its mistakes. This is called ""unsupervised learning."" AI can also use heuristics to make decisions, which means it uses logic and common sense to make decisions. So, while data is helpful, it is not always necessary for AI to function.

# 2. AI always makes decisions with no human input.

Again, this is only true if you define AI as ""a computer system that performs tasks that would normally be done by humans."" In that case, AI needs human input to function. But AI is also capable of making decisions on its own. This is called ""autonomous AI."" Autonomous AI can make decisions without human input because it has been programmed to do so. However, it is important to note that autonomous AI is still influenced by human decisions. For example, it is programmed with a set of rules, but those rules can be changed by humans. So, while autonomous AI may make decisions on its own, it is still influenced by human decision-making.

# 3. AI always makes decisions based on statistics.

This is only true if you define AI as ""a computer system that performs tasks that would normally be done by humans."" In that case, AI uses statistics to make decisions. However, AI is also capable of using other methods to make decisions. For example, it can use natural language processing (NLP) to understand language and make decisions based on that understanding. It can also use machine learning (ML) to make decisions based on patterns it has learned. So, while statistics are important, they are not the only way AI makes decisions.

# 4. AI always replaces human workers.

This is only true if you define AI as ""a computer system that performs tasks that would normally be done by humans."" In that case, AI does replace human workers in some cases. For example, it can be used to automate tasks that are repetitive or dangerous. However, AI is also used to complement human workers, not replace them. For example, it can be used to assist doctors in making diagnoses. It can also be used to help farmers monitor crops and optimize yields",524,4,2475

$1.$ What makes quantum mechanics ""so interesting""?

Quantum mechanics is primarily interesting because a) its predictions are experimentally validated and b) it is our most complete theory so far of physical reality which we see around us, including the entire history of the universe up to the present moment. Using the arguments provided by Mach, Schroedinger, Einstein, and De Broglie, Born and Dirac gave a more precise meaning to 'reality' than had been provided by classical physics, which was a theory that already had a couple of centuries worth of experimental validation, so that quantum mechanics needed to be built upon this more substantive basis than anything that was available at the time.

In the beginning of the 20th century, when scientists started to understand the principle of the atom, they wondered how the energy is quantized.

Classical physics says that a photon always carries a fixed amount of energy - $$E=hf=\hbar\omega$$:

Have I forgotten you something? Nah! This is because the dynamic approach to organisational architecture and how organisations are set up and how they work, does matter in a way that many organisations and people now dismiss to give the board of directors and management the prominence they deserve.
I am talking about those neglected areas of organisations where good management is supposed to do its bit and yet, people, left to themselves are not organised to do their best. When left to themselves, these professional areas are known to be subject to short-term thinking, delayed reactions and decision making and above all else poor teamwork. I am talking about things like employee training, on-the-job training, safety, security and environmental management systems.
These were the neglected areas that the International Labour Organisation thought was not being given the importance it deserved. Accordingly, in November 2012, it organised a conference to draw more attention to the need to integrate those aspects in all policies. The title of the conference was ’Security of work, worker protection and decent work promotion, to establish a legally binding UN instrument to strengthen international labour standards’.
Nations that attended included Cambodia, Gabon, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Spain, Myanmar, Paraguay, Mauritania, Mauritius, New Zealand, Nicaragua, and Ecuador. There were not many, but these were the select few on the agenda to draw our attention to the significance of adopting the right organizational structure that enables people to collaborate and do their best.
This kind of thinking is similar to the thinking of humans worldwide when it comes to social psychology. According to Dr Stephen Post of the Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, he views the development of cultures as ‘dual’ and interlinked with health. This interlink between healthy organisational culture and health development is what has motivated him to change health institutions worldwide, especially hospitals. Dr Post found that healthy culture of health institutions means that both workers and patients feel cared for and that patients are healthy because the organisational culture is healthy.
Yes, the challenges of healthcare institution cannot be looked at in isolation of the challenges of health workers. The same can be said about the successes in developing healthy organisational culture. It also depends upon organizational health outcomes, staff health outcomes and ultimately patient health outcomes.

Another thing: standards are set by the industry, not by corporations. It is from the industry that you get things like the PSP specification for settings, and probably more importantly, terms like ""REC 709"". Rec 709, like MPEG1 and 2, is not a standard. It is a format, an encoding. Therefore, it will never change.
All the above is to say that to this day, the set of standards we work under to do post production color correction is not standardized.
This lack of standardization, one of the main reasons we see so many different interpretations of color work.
The goal of this site is to provide a standard set of guidelines to understand, and follow, the color space of Rec. 709.
This is part of what I do as a colorist. So the idea is, what I understand, I will share on this site. So if you work with me, you can make sure we're on the same page.
Some of the main points to remember is that Rec. 709 is meant to be as close as possible to the the ""human eye"" as possible. It doesn't mean it has to be natural. Colorists can (and do) add color and create artful looks on standard Def. scan.
The purpose of defining color space is to reduce confusion. When you read an article that talks about a color space, what does that mean? Someone was likely using a different color space, than the person that wrote the article!
Rec 709 is meant to take the experience of the human eye into account. A less desirable thing to do is adjust the color of human perception by using a space, like XYZ, which can distort the perception. This distorts it to emulate how we see and how we would perceive the image if it were actually what we were looking at. It is impossible to make an image look exactly like what we would see in reality. Fortunately, Rec 709 does not try to do that. It is an attempt to come as close to what we would see, while also being a technically correct color space.

Vertebrate body size is correlated with brain size, but the evolutionary transformation of brain size is poorly understood. Historically, small mammal brains have been considered relatively more plastic. We tested this hypothesis in brain development by manipulating neural precursor cells in three species of neonatal rats. We found that the brain is a particularly slow-growing tissue; a 50% increase in brain mass consumed 20 times more neurons than the excess in length of a similarly sized mammal, and over 100 times more than the increase in body size. A comparison of young and aged brains in the three species also demonstrated plasticity of the brain during aging. However, long-term changes in cell number over the course of brain development were not found. The differences in predicted neurogenesis accounted for 10% of the reported phenotypic variation in brain mass across three species. This suggests that ontogeny is regulated at the level of neural precursor cells, rather than uncontrolled growth.",201,4,1062
1254,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and how it contributes to our understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate.
Oceanography is the study of the ocean, its processes, and its interactions with the earth's climate. It is a multidisciplinary field that combines physical, chemical, biological, and geological disciplines to understand the ocean's role in climate regulation and change.

Oceanographers study the ocean's physical, chemical, and biological properties, such as temperature, salinity, currents, nutrients, and oxygen levels, to gain insights into climate change, weather patterns, and ecosystem dynamics. They also explore the ocean's seafloor and monitor its response to natural and anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change.

Oceanography contributes to our understanding of the ocean's role in climate regulation and change by providing a comprehensive picture of the ocean's physical, chemical, and biological processes. This knowledge helps scientists understand how the ocean absorbs, transports, and releases heat and other forms of energy, and how these processes affect atmospheric temperature and circulation patterns. It also informs the development of climate models, which help predict future climate patterns and the potential impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and coastal communities. Finally, oceanography informs policymakers on how to manage the ocean's resources and mitigate its impacts on the climate, including through policies such as ocean conservation, marine protected areas, and carbon emissions reduction initiatives.

Can you provide examples of how oceanographers have used their research to inform climate policies?
Sure, here are a few examples:

1. Ocean acidification: Ocean acidification is caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by the ocean, which lowers the pH of seawater. This process has been linked to a decline in marine life, and ocean acidification has also been shown to have impacts on the carbon cycle and climate. Researchers have used their understanding of ocean chemistry and physics to develop models that predict future changes in ocean acidity, and have used this information to inform climate policies.

2. Coastal flooding: Rising sea levels due to climate change threaten coastal cities and communities. Oceanographers have used their knowledge of coastal processes and models to predict future changes in sea level, and to inform policymakers about the potential impacts of coastal flooding on the communities that live along coasts.

3. Marine protected areas: Oceanographers have played a key role in developing the science behind marine protected areas (MPAs). These areas are protected from human activity to allow marine ecosystems to recover, and they can help to reduce the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.",535,4,2852

The Edo period in Japan lasted from 1603 to 1868 and was characterized by political stability, economic growth, and the rise of a centralized government. During this time, the art of the Edo period was influenced by the court culture of the Tokugawa shogunate, which was centered in the imperial city of Kyoto.

The Edo period is notable for its development of Ukiyo-e (Floating World) art, which depicted the daily life of common people in a series of printed woodblock prints. Ukiyo-e art was heavily influenced by the court culture of the Edo period, as it was created for the consumption of the common people and reflected the social values of the time.

Another significant development in the Edo period was the rise of Western-style art, which was introduced to Japan by Dutch traders in the late 16th century. Western-style art was initially used in diplomatic and trade relations with the Western world, but it gradually made its way into Japanese art and became a popular medium for painters and sculptors.

The Edo period was also marked by the development of calligraphy, which was closely associated with the court culture of the time. Calligraphy was considered a high art form and was often commissioned by the nobility and the merchant class.

Overall, the court culture of the Edo period greatly influenced the art of the time, particularly in the development of Ukiyo-e art, Western-style art, and calligraphy. These art forms reflected the social values and aesthetic preferences of the time and continue to be celebrated and studied by art historians and collectors today.

What were the specific techniques used in creating Ukiyo-e art during the Edo period?
During the Edo period, the Ukiyo-e art form was created by using woodblock printing techniques. The artist would create a design on a piece of paper or wood, which was then transferred onto a wooden block using a chisel or gouge. The block was then coated with ink, which was transferred onto paper or silk when the printing process was completed.

In addition to the woodblock printing technique, there were several specific techniques used in Ukiyo-e art, including:

1. Bokashi: This technique involved blending different shades of ink to create a smooth, graduated effect. This technique was commonly used for creating shadows and other subtle shading.

2. Hatching: This technique involved using a series of parallel lines to create shading and",498,4,2492

1261,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," There is a certain level of study that goes into it which takes time and can sometimes seem complex, but let’s break it down to one fundamental truth, setting a background is the way to make your subject pop!
This is the one area of a background that will put your image to the test. The Rule of Thirds is a popular guideline where the image is divided in thirds by a small horizontal and vertical line. A point of interest is placed on each of these lines. When looking at the image, it doesn’t matter which point of interest is place on the grid. What is important is where the eyes flow to first, which is why we call it the “rule” and not a “rule”. So how does the split horizontal and vertical lines bring your image to life? With this simple tool you can place a point of interest on each of these lines allowing the primary point of interest to draw the most attention while leading the eye around the frame. Think of it as a flow of energy, in a sense, that will travel through the image allowing viewers to experience a sense of freedom through the photograph.
Now there is one more key element to a good background; colour. Since your photograph has a background, it’s important to be able to use it to your advantage. The background should compliment the subject, not overpower it.
Light always plays a role in setting a background in any photographic scene, even with simple scenes. Let your light be your guide! With that said, this can be a little tricky to understand when the actual technique is so simple to grasp. I am sure you have heard of the rule of thirds before, well this is the one that you can count on with lighting. But let’s expand on this idea. Most of the times when we photograph something the background gives us a lot of space where the eye can rest and think on whatever is placed within it. Instead, let’s get technical for a moment and think about composition. The background should always be simple! Just as we feel when we enter a nice lounge, we come to a space that brings us peace. We expect a certain level of calmness and a simple environment. If the background is simple and balanced, we can relax. Why would this concept be important when shooting a portrait? The same is true for a portrait. We need to create an atmosphere that will allow the subject to breathe. For instance, if you are photographing a man in a suit and tie in a luxury club, the subject should be sitting on a comfortable chair that doesn",519,4,2457

The modules were compiled by a global community of experts assembled by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the philanthropic news agency of Reuters news organisation. It is the world's largest producer of free, daily news and information about human rights, gender equality, women’s empowerment, climate change, the environment, biodiversity, health, population and agriculture, available in more than 100 languages.
The modules were inspired by a recent conference about Journalism and Climate Change, where almost 400 attendees raised five major themes of concern about climate change journalism.
Among them:
- Introduce the problem of climate change before laying out the complexity of the science
- Find key news value in the story, such as scarcity or conflict
- Listen to an interviewee and not try to redirect the subject
- Set up a serious conversation on where to go next when the facts are not clear
- Figure out what the story is about and who the audience is
The eight pages of new guidelines now available online are essential reading for newsrooms grappling with how to write effectively about this international crisis that is reshaping the world.
New modules for reporting on climate change
More than 20 modules spread across two volumes – “Coping with Climate Change” (Vol. 1) and “Reporting on Climate Change” (Vol. 2) – offer examples, explanations and questions to help writers navigate this tricky terrain. Teachers and students can download them at no cost from here..
The new guidelines grew out of a collaboration between the Thomson Reuters Foundation and Oxford University Centre for Theoretical Linguistics, based at Oxford University’s department of Linguistics. The University Centre for Theoretical Linguistics is the world’s first Centre for Language Analysis of Document Texts. The two-year-old Centre’s expertise is particularly relevant to climate change reporting, with the Centre’s",492,4,2699

So, all researches involved in neuroscientists are extremely difficult and complicated. So, there are a lot of benefits that neuroscience give to mankind. You might be wondering why does it have all the benefits. So, there are few reasons why neuroscience have benefit to mankind.

So, here are the benefits of neuroscience:
1. It gives the most comprehensive explanation of how the brain works and what are the functions of the human brain.
2. It allows neuroscience to dive into the structure and function of the brain. It helps to show different kinds of components and how brain work.
3. Neuroscience are focuses on the latest technology and experimental methods and techniques. It helps to find the structure of the brain and how to improve brain.
4. It helps to find ways to improve overall health and higher intelligence.
5. Neuroscience uses new technologies to figure out how to store memories and consolidate learning.
6. It helps to search for the new cures for the neurological and mental disorders.
7. Neuroscience gives awareness to people about the brain and its function. It makes people about the human brain and the function of the brain.
8. It is considered as the most effective way to cure mental and neurological problems such as OCD, ADHD and autism
9. By using neural prosthesis helps to restore neurological disability

So, I hope this helps you understand the benefits of neuroscience. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.",309,4,1577
1268,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," change science have provided convincing evidence that anthropogenic climate change will lead to widespread and long-lasting economic impacts, including changes in extreme weather patterns and sea level. In 2015, the G20 endorsed the work of the international Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which was established as a result of the Paris agreement to guide reporting by financial institutions. In 2019, 39 jurisdictions covering more than 65 per cent of global financial assets formally adopted the TCFD recommendations, and the European Union is phasing in the requirement for disclosure by institutional investors and insurers.
Banks, pension funds and insurers in the US are among the largest and most powerful investors in the world, with total assets of almost USD 12 trillion and responsibilities over life savings of 284 million investors. If effective, efforts to encourage voluntary climate risk disclosure by these financial institutions could increase public awareness of investment risks, prompt investor action on climate, and help to level the playing field for non-financial industries making investments that will help ensure a sustainable climate.
In order to add value to governments' domestic reporting efforts, ICLEI is engaging with G20 members and other G20 Action Track partners to drive voluntary public disclosure by financial institutions, and to improve the quality of information being collected to fill gaps in what is currently available, particularly through the use of ICLEI's Innovative Market Systems (IMS) framework, as an analytical aid to identifying investment opportunities, risk, and strategies for GHG emissions reductions.
""Finance leaders across the G20 need better access to climate data and analytics from innovative technologies to inform decision making as climate risks become increasingly disruptive. This is a key issue, and ICLEI has launched a global initiative to accelerate financing for the shift toward a low carbon world.""
ICLEI's local authorities have been leading the way on establishing global standards for climate risk and resilience disclosure by local governments. The newly established Local Government Climate Risk Research Alliance is providing funding for the development of innovative, online tools that will help more than 2,000 local governments worldwide to estimate the risk associated with climate change to their infrastructure and economic assets, to identify adaptation and mitigation actions, and to calculate the cost of those actions. Partners in this effort include the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the World Resources Institute, Project Drawdown, S&P Global Market Intelligence, Tesla, the San Francisco Foundation and CityLab.
An important area of focus is on low carbon investment",504,4,2812

Graduate programs that lead to professional degrees in oceanography and ocean-related degrees are numerous across the US, with even more graduate programs abroad. A possible problem is that many of these programs are fairly high level programs, not at the undergraduate level and may even require significant time commitment to study from scratch. Not knowing much about oceanography the first obstacle is knowing where to start.

From what I know right now a good place to start would be:

1. Exploring a handful of undergraduate ocean programs

2. Possibly with a bit of research into graduate programs, specifically on their requirements.

3. Perhaps coming to terms with what is the most efficient way of gaining knowledge. In other words one may attempt to manage a healthy do-to list and then choose what to do next based on the available schedule. My experience is that managing schedules is one of the key skills that help organize something as unmanageable as oceanography. Therefore, I don’t see a single good way to be approach this. It is a long exercise and what may seem optimal today may change later.

4. Start to learn the basics (ie. if you want to be a marine biologist or physicist, consider learning your way through some books).

5. Start to learn from classes, honestly, having a graduate student and a course to guide through would have made this a whole lot easier. Our path of exploration went the opposite direction, especially because we were discussing marine biology with a lab that don’t do marine biology.

6. Take courses (that will also depend on the university requirements for the program), but, I have found that not so many schools and programs ask for a physics background. On the other hand you’ll have to take calculus.

7. Implement and run experiments (I feel this is a distinct separation), and get ahold on the work that needs to be done (the tasks) and how these tasks are all connected to solve a problem.

There are other useful materials around the internet to get started. For example, as mentioned, Wikipedia gives an overview of oceanography and has a list of schools for oceanography programs. The Oceanography Society has a huge list of graduate programs for oceanography in the US and overseas. By simply visiting the websites of the schools that list their degrees as oceanography or marine and as minor you can find out what you need to be admitted in each graduate program. For example, the University of Washington lists a list of undergraduate and graduate oceanography and marine programs. Many programs have lists of core and elective course and point to cur",519,4,2622

1271,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Meditation works by helping you change the way your mind works.

Think of your mind as a radio that's tuned to a particular frequency. The radio you have can only pick up a certain kind of signal. If you try to tune into a different signal, it will just keep repeating the same sound over and over again, because that's the only signal you have access to.

Similarly, when we're not in meditation, our minds are constantly receiving all kinds of thoughts and ideas, all the time. But some of these thoughts are tied to negative emotions like anxiety and fear. When these thoughts keep popping up, it's like a station that's stuck on one particular frequency – it keeps repeating the same thing over and over again, and it can be really hard to escape.

Meditation, however, helps us change the way we think. It helps us tune our minds into new frequencies, where we can receive all kinds of new information and experiences. Over time, as we continue to meditate, our minds become less tied to these negative thoughts, and we become more able to receive the positive, uplifting ideas that we want.

Meditation helps us change the way we think. It's like turning down the volume of our minds, so that we can finally hear the things that we need to hear, and the things that will help us grow and improve. It's a wonderful thing, and it's something that everyone can benefit from.",295,4,1378

While The Showroom are of course the industry's leaders in wardrobe management and run more shows than anyone else each season, they were an unknown quantity when it came to advertising and PR and so it was The Showroom who approached us when they realised they needed new graphics for an event currently on their books.
Here we briefly outline the various stages, from the initial contact, right through to the exhibition itself, giving an insight into the work done by the Fine Grooms team in producing these great graphics.
The brief from The Showroom was fairly open ended. They wanted to be able to showcase the collections of five different designers on four different levels, incorporating a model dining area and providing a platform for presenting each show.
However, we also knew that the team at The Showroom needed to rely on us if their exhibit was to stand out from the crowd.
After a careful examination of the project, we came back with three initial concepts to a show that would have the most impact on the individual attending the event. Although each concept was different, they all would have been within the tight confines of the finished exhibition area - the model dining area was to be at the entrance, the staging at the rear and the individual designer stands in between, with the respective collections on the walkways above.
Once the concepts were agreed, we knew it was time to design an exhibition space from scratch. Our initial guess at the exhibition area we'd be working with was wrong, but we were able to quickly change a couple of our key design elements to allow for the extra space we were now working with and this also allowed us to incorporate the changes that The Showroom had made to their layouts at quite late notice.
Our design was split into three key sections: model dinning area, the walkways and the show stage. Each section used a different colour scheme but still fitted together harmoniously. The model dinning area, for example, was designed to let diners know that this was where they would eat, looking in from the outside to the interior.
However, you are not finished after you have designed the set, as the graphics at each stand still have to look professional and work within the stand's design. This is true of the stage, although any graphics have to be carefully designed so that they don't occlude the models in the show, who have",522,4,2625

In the United States, Bentham's ideas were chiefly popularized by Harvard professor James Bryce in his book English Studies (1870-76). A later editor, Samuel Willard Dwight, wrote a commentary on this book called American Studies in English Law in 1877. After dealing with the historical development of ethics and morals up to the general acceptance of the Moral Order in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the later editions of the book turn to consideration of the early development of business ethics in eighteenth and nineteenth century America. Here the discussion includes America's first school for seamanship and shipping, a Marine Hospital, New Jersey, ship jockeys and auctioneers, auction and retail prices, the duties of a master mariner, cases of maritime liens, mechanics and apprentice systems, the pilots of New York, and American seamen.

1285,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and the trouble of sustainability
A very critical view of sustainable tourism has been suggested by Graham, Willis and Wearing (2007), as they argue that “tourism, an industry that depends on natural and human resources in the periphery, is destroying these very resources in the periphery” (p. 5). This perspective clearly reflects the minority and often neglected voices that have been exposed and brought into light over the years in various universities and NGOs as a result of the tourism’s limitations and shortcomings. Whatever the concept and its background, an eco-tourist can be defined as someone who travels for the purpose of experiencing environmental and cultural tourism. Rather than consuming prepackaged, mass-produced tourist destinations, a more sustainable practice involves discovering an unfamiliar place and living like the locals do for a short time, therefore understanding the negative effects that tourism may cause. Here, sustainability is completely neglected. Sustainable tourism is a movement and not a practice. Sustainability is key in order to preserve our planets natural resources for the next generation, including nature, wildlife, water, soil, and air quality. As soon as the tourists are brought into the destination, the inevitable wear and tear on the resources begins and the building blocks of sustainability fall apart. Unsustainable and unnourishing for both nature and animals, consumptive tourism must be adapted to fit the core objectives of preserving local cultures and traditions. Tourism and Development are both linked to one and other, or in other words, the more tourism goes, the more it disturbs the local culture and vice versa. This vicious circle will therefore increase the economic and political impacts that will create additional problems, eventually damaging the environment (Talayero and Griessler, 2011). According to Gregg and Burrowes (2001), an honest definition of sustainable tourism is “tourism in a socio-economic context, which exists for people, for their spiritual enrichment, and which develops in a context of local culture and natural resources (high environmental quality and animal and flora and fauna) without the individual feeling that it is asking for more than it has been able to provide (p. 2). “
It is obvious that sustainable tourism has not found enough acceptance on a large scale yet. Issues with implementing sustainability have been rooted in the many myths associated with it. Some of the myths we encounter includes: inefficient conservation, excessive cost, unequal distribution of benefits (Talayero and Griessler, 2011), and unfair resentment.

As an art form, it improves the quality of life of millions of people through its many physical and social benefits. By enabling them to connect with other people, dance brings communities together. It also helps individuals create a dialogue with themselves and improve their health.
The dance discipline is not a new phenomenon. It has been practiced for centuries by various cultures, and its popularity has grown over time. Though the art of dance as we know it today had developed from classical ballet, it has since evolved into a new discipline of its own. This has allowed modern dancers to maintain their passion and remain relevant to audiences around the world. In fact, some of the most famous modern dancers have inspired dancers to pursue a career in the dance industry.
The discipline of dance has many benefits, and it's not limited to physical health. It can improve emotional health, reduce anxiety, and help individuals find better ways to deal with stress. In addition, it is a way to express one's creativity. It has many benefits for the brain as well as the body. It helps individuals relax their minds and bodies. The physical health benefits of dancing are numerous, and it can even help people improve their self-esteem. This can lead to greater confidence in oneself and the ability to socialize with others.
Unlike other forms of art, modern dance incorporates elements of other styles, such as jazz, ballet, and modern, into its practice. Most modern dancers will learn these elements separately and then eventually combine them. This allows them to enhance their performances with more flexibility and agility. The art of dance has become more popular today, and the skill of a modern dancer has become a prized commodity. While many people don't consider this as an art, it is an essential part of modern society.
While traditional dance has its roots in classical ballet and other forms, modern dance has evolved to include a variety of styles. Its roots are in hip-hop, contemporary dance, and jazz. Many of these styles are now combined in the same performance. This type of dance is unique to the individual and is meant to express emotions and different aspects of oneself. While it is important to understand the history of modern dance, it is also crucial to understand its roots.",473,4,2441

By combining the presence of a camera on the block, new technology and appearance theater that will give a greater feeling of realism, everything will be performed with highly advanced technology.
Augmented and virtual reality theater
It is a new concept that has not yet shown the public. Theater can be made part artificial and part real, with the participation of the actors, but with the new technology that we know today, such as augmented reality applications and virtual reality experiences.
Theater taken to the web
After the theaters shut down due to the pandemic, and the world had to endure the distance caused by coronavirus, one proposal that seems to be still ahead is the possibility of making theater entirely on the web. In Spain, for example, some theaters have already bet on the web, and the result has been more than satisfactory.
Theater, as a general example
For the moment we have virtual reality, but other technologies can also enter. Some propose to add robots. At an international level, a theatrical company of Saint Paul, in Minnesota, made their show on the streets, with a camera on their bicycles, for many hours to capture it, which with the help of special software, they got the most emotional feelings through new ways. Of course, the latest technologies will surely be applied to theater, but it is a discipline in which it will be difficult to fully change their management.
Advantages of virtual reality
Virtual Reality or VR provides an experience designed to be as lifelike and immersive as possible. That doesn't mean it has to be in a physical space. Each performance will be different and will respond to all the factors that are necessarily part of theater. At this time we are still seeing the future of theater through a virtual curtain, and we will always have to wait for the limitations of the present to be resolved.",368,4,1896

For the past 14 years a strong commitment to sociology, and to a growing group of sociology practitioners in the UK, is Helen Featherstone's world. In this interview, she reflects on her role as the first female President of the British Sociological Association (in June 2014 she was re-elected for a second term).
Alongside her association with the BSA, Featherstone is perhaps best-known for her own research into domestic abuse, but a commitment to widening access to the academic discipline of sociology and to ensuring that the term 'refugee' is not used merely as a political football has also long been at the heart of her research. In this interview, Featherstone reflects on her research, her time as a fellow of the ESRC, and her personal passion for sociology.
​Q. What is the most rewarding thing about being a sociologist? The most rewarding thing is the ability to communicate the findings of the work I do to the public, the ability to communicate things which are, if not taken into account, then quite certainly missed. While this sounds obvious, there has never been such a need to make this case, given the criticism of an academic discipline that so many commentators put forward. It is doubly satisfying to then receive so many letters from people, who have heard about your work through the press or television, thanking you for bringing to their attention something that they either never knew or wanted to question further, that is, the extent to which a form of 'everyday' inaction could reproduce inequality.
Q. What is the most dispiriting thing about being a sociologist?
Another thing which is tremendously important in sociology and that is the ability to point to contradictions. There are very few disciplines which I think do this as well as sociology does. It is important to question the things you are most used to, you are most comfortable with, you find most 'obvious'. Many of my colleagues in sociology have allowed themselves to be suffocated by the things they are most convinced of. And this is something we should not allow ourselves to do.
Q. What is the best thing about being a sociologist in the early 21st Century?
The role of the sociologist as a critic of society, as a dissenter in society, still has enormous value. Of course, the ability to transmit these criticisms to a wider audience has never been as important as it is now. So for me, the best thing about being a sociologist in the",502,4,2467

Such knowledge comes into its own during calculations and experiments which require intricate math: calculating the frequency of sound waves, calculating distance traveled in a given amount of time, and other situations in which calculating a moving object’s momentum or velocity is required, not to mention force in the case of collisions.
What you need to know before you start a physics study is that every physics measurement is made up of two different pieces of information. One is simply a number. The other is the unit in which this number is expressed. For example, 27 in the unit centimeters is no good. But 27 centimeters is. In physics, you don’t simply measure, you measure in some unit of measure. Take, for example, the length of an object. If the object measures 4 inches long, that’s telling you just about nothing. What you really want to know is that the object measures 4 inches (or feet or meters or centimeters or whatever your chosen measurement unit is).
The international standard is SI units (short for International System of Units). SI units have become standard in virtually all scientific and industrial fields of work, in physics, engineering, as well as in places like the military, the medical industry, and even in our homes.
In physics, the basic measure is the mole or mol for short, the SI unit of amount of substance. Here’s the deal: a mole of anything contains 6.02214179 x 10 23 particles of whatever you’re dealing with. That number (known in physics circles as Avogadro’s number) is also known as the exact number of particles in 12 grams of 12C carbon (atomic weight 12). Just remember this: 6.022 x 10 23 is the exact number of particles in 1 mole.
Before you can talk about moles in any science-related field, you must first learn to express measurements in some unit of weight. The basic weight is the gram or the gramme (g). Each gram is equal to 1/1,000th of a kilogram. And the gram is the base unit of weight measurement in the metric system (the one that’s in use around the world).
To multiply, add the gram amount by the number. To divide, divide the gram amount by the number.
The combination of grams and mole for measuring large numbers of particles comes in handy when talking about how much matter",494,4,2293

This is my MOOC application (11/24/13) to teach a college course in genetics. I am not affiliated with the teachers in charge of the course. I am unfamiliar with the school, class, or textbook they will be using in the class. This MOOC is a curation of various online resources, including:

• Kahn Academy videos on algebra, pre-algebra, geometry, triangles, and SAT practice.
• The Shmoop Intro to Genetics and Genomes course (though I removed most Shmoop content; this is my own writing, though heavily informed by other sources). Note this course contains a focus on human genetics rather than the general topics presented below.
• To which I add a “Gene Family Tree” question set.
• I have also included Khan Academy practice videos on physics and calculus.

Here are the topics I intend to address with this MOOC, most of which I will add to continually as time allows.

### Introduction to First Principles

The focus of this MOOC is to introduce students to basic principles underlying genetics, genomics, and medicine. The principle is to teach the content in “first principles,” that is, with an emphasis on a strong foundational understanding. The concepts are not explained via a scientific literature review, but rather explained simply and as clearly as possible (though in complete generality if possible). Students are encouraged to use the first principles in every day lives when talking about genetics.

Next Steps

• I would like to continue adding e-books or videos, and create a library of useful “self-learning” content.
• Collect practice problems/questions for me to add to the site.
• Collect online reading/online videos and examplar practice problems/questions.
• Create interactive web pages with practice problems for each topic.
• Develop a way for the student to check answers at their own pace.

An example of an idea is this YouTube video of Feynman speaking about 5th grade mathematics, where he explains common errors with multiplication, division, fractions, and addition. Here is the transcript and transcript of that video at our blog.

These topics can also be included in a broader “Introduction to Science” class, as a bridge from math to physics, biology, and chemistry, or for advanced STEM students to get a jumping-off point for other content. Just consider these the “first principles” of physics.

1297,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is the philosophical theory which guides the design, construction, and structural integrity of buildings. The philosophy of architecture is a literary area of the philosophy of science that examines how ideas and methods influence the design and construction of the built environment. Analytic philosophy, including linguistics and logic, is utilized as a methodology to inform issues involving natural language and art. It attempts to answer the question ""What is architecture and what makes it distinct from other philosophically significant art forms?""  Many philosophers examine the relationship of architecture and art. The examination of these relationships is often referred to as the philosophy of architecture and architecture as a philosophical problem.
The word architect is derived from the Latin architectura, which in turn is derived from the Greek αρχιτεκτονική (arkhitektonikí) meaning ""master builder"" from αρχι- (arch-) ""chief"" and τέκτων (técton) ""builder"" or ""craftsman"". The Greek verb αρχιτεκτονεύω (arkhitektonesú) simply means ""to be a master builder or to function in the capacity of architect."" The prefix αρχι- may be used to convey a range of meanings in various contexts including the first, chief, superior, or head.
From this origin the term came to be used for the art of building and an early definition of an architect was ""the author of any thing beautiful in the line of contrivance."".
The theme of philosophy of art is the role and importance of design; in artistic terms, this may mean the relationship between utility and beauty, as in the definition of architecture as ""the art of ordering the elements of a building for the sake of symmetry, utility, and beauty."" Others have discussed architecture as a communication medium through which one person endeavors to connect with the needs, desires, values and traditions of another.
Philosophers, social scientists, architects, and other individuals have studied human art in general, and architectural design and production in particular, for thousands of years. Philosophical analysis of art and architecture began in ancient Greece and has continued into the present day.
In the New Testament of the Bible, the Greek adjective ἀρχιτέκτων occurs only in Jude 4 (conveying the meaning ""Master builder"", ""chief builder"" or ""principal architect"") in the phrase ""Men who said to have disappeared {βλέπει",504,4,2390

1. All rocks consist of the same minerals.
The vast majority of the rocks in the Earth's crust consist of different minerals, each with its own chemical and mineralogical properties. If we were to melt all the rocks on the Earth, we would obtain a substance called rock melt. By dissolving this substance in water and cooling it, it would form minerals that are found in rocks throughout the Earth. But one sample of melt would not be exactly like another sample of melt; the concentrations of the minerals in each sample would be different. And there is a certain range of the proportions of mineral constituents that rocks can contain. Therefore it is unlikely that identical minerals are found throughout the Earth.
2. Different rocks form at different temperatures.
Much to the surprise of many, there are rocks that form at a high temperature, that is at high pressure as well as rocks that form at low temperatures, that is at low pressure. In fact, most rocks form at intermediate temperatures and pressures, with more important cooling effects occurring at lower temperatures. During periods of geologic history, the cooling of the crust depends on the amount of volcanic activity occurring, and the composition of the mantle. Thus, the thermal structure of the Earth has changed over the age of the Earth. However, it appears that rocks only started forming rocks at high temperatures during and after the period of massive volcanism called the Chixculub Event. For example, granite rocks only form at relatively low temperatures. This is because most of the granite is formed in the current lower layer of the crust in the form of igneous rocks, that is, below the Earth's crustal surface. This is also true of all the mineral rich igneous rocks such as mafic igneous rocks, diorite, basalt, gabbro, pegmatite, granite porphyry, marble, pegmatite, peridotite, obsidian, pumice, limestone and quartzite, to mention just a few. Some of these rocks form at very low temperatures, such as peridotite, which consists of olivine (the crystal structure of the mineral olivine is close to hexagonal). The natural process of metamorphism means that it is heated and cooled as part of crustal processes. If it were not for these natural processes, the rocks would form at much lower temperatures.

Read more to find out.
A few years ago, a floating robot developed by scientists at the University of Pennsylvania was designed to be used for psychiatric therapy. It is claimed that it can navigate social and emotional problems, with its minimal design and bot-like mannerisms allegedly keeping it from being threatening to vulnerable people. Being alien and not perceived as human may be its greatest appeal – that and a well-constructed psychology. Clever, yet subtle.
Robots are often functional and popular because their artistry lies in their bleak and unforgiving design. They fit into their surroundings and can be utilised as either ‘negative space’ or ‘positive space’, being either void or filled as a still, silent entity.
One might look at In The Woods by Yinka Shonibare with this in mind – cold metal and a sans-serf-like stature lends itself well to the miserable robot, though it is contoured differently to make the display more effective. Though more cyber-robotic, the same can be applied to Frankenstein’s Monster.
Frankenstein’s Monster is fascinating because it is threatening in appearance. In the world of zombies, vampires and similar postures, the robot is the most interesting of the lot. The pale complexion, the angular face and atypical stature make it almost inhuman, and in a world where the ability to move is linked to humanity, it becomes rather off-putting. It is questionable as to whether the Frankenstein Monster would fall into the Jekyll and Hyde categories, being too primitive for decent experiments, but too advanced for basic criminal tasks.
Terry Jones would suggest the Frankenstein Monster is atypical of robots because of the sheer speed and technology behind the man/machine hybrid. Clearly there are laws which forbid it now, but other, newer creations like the android are now permitted on the legal market. However, the development of these synthetic versions has become a grey area of both the science and crime. The thought that a robot could lay eggs seems distasteful, and the idea that it could possibly be used for evil purposes only adds to the mythical qualities of both the enigmatic Frankenstein Monster and the smaller-yet-just-as-sinister pseudo android.

Robotics 101

People ask: what does [a robot] look like, and where does it come from? Here's my best answer.

The most fundamental thing we know about the machines we call robots is that they are automata, or systems that repeat a task. So a robot is, first of all, an automaton. Second, it has to do some function -- when you put it together, what will it do? Third, you have to be able to construct it: the components have to be manufactured or can be manufactured and then put together. If you buy it already assembled, there's a good chance it's a computer, not a robot. Because, fourth, in order for a machine to be a robot, the first and second conditions imply that it also has to be a machine.

A robot is composed of several parts. First, the software. How to build an automaton from scratch is a process we'll look at later. But the essential thing about programs -- and the lesson we'll learn today -- is that they are stored in a specific form. A computer is nothing but a fancy box that plays with memory. The real machine is the memory chip; the box, the reader (hardware) and the word processor (software). Just as we call the keyboard of an electronic organ ""an organ,"" we call this a ""robot processor."" The reader reads the signals from the keyboard and writes them to the hardware. The processor runs on a code, a bunch of numbers we call ""bits,"" that runs on the software. That's a simplified explanation, but it's the truth. For humans, the processor is the brain, software the mind and the programming languages are the language. The bits are the thought patterns.

Then there is the hardware. Whatever a robot is made of, it has to move or remain still. It can't be done without physical parts. We'll look at these later.

Finally, there is power and output. All this work would be done for nothing unless you could use the information to do something useful. That's our power supply: energy. You have to store some energy, and then you have to convert it to movement and output.

So this is how a robot works. Let's look at the components from the bottom up. First, power. Remember that",518,4,2253
1307,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is a topic related to Art and in order to understand what is at stake, it is necessary to deconstruct it and reconnect it to its very basic meaning.
The criteria that inform the definition of art and art object change over time and different parts of the world. Art is like a language, its meaning and usage might be different for everybody. Nevertheless, art can connect diverse groups of people with shared philosophical or socio-political concerns (for more examples, visit Our Values website). One may not consider, for instance, the anti-war sculpture Saint Joan of Arc by Pablo Picasso, created in 1937, as a work of art, just because in this case art is understood as pure entertainment.
There are very different art forms and arts from different points of view. For instance, the visual arts might differ from the performing arts such as music and dance. Let’s say, this implies that arts are a category in the field of culture where expression can vary quite considerably in artistic movement and expression forms. One has to differentiate fine art from arts used for broader cultural, social and economic usage. The same applies to other art forms such as visual arts. In this case one has to distinguish between forms, media and techniques in visual arts, for example.
Furthermore, a distinction is often made between art and art history. However, in a contemporary context the line has often become blurred, since art has become a wide field of cultural and art production. An example of the blurred boundaries in the field of art are digital art or installations.
The main thing is to look at art production from a broad perspective. In doing so, one may recognise that art is fundamentally not only about aesthetic or aesthetic pleasure. The object of art encompasses all of human life and culture. For us, the term art nowadays refers to works of art – this means, objects we associate with particular forms of artistic creativity such as visual arts, music or literature. In order to enrich the debate on what is at stake in art production, it is useful to examine other facets such as art history or aesthetics.",422,4,2129

Meteorology is the study of the Earth’s atmosphere and how it changes over time. This includes the weather, the atmosphere’s temperature, humidity, pressure, and other weather conditions. Meteorology is important because it helps us predict future weather conditions and understand how the atmosphere affects our lives.
There are several key terms and concepts that beginners should know when studying meteorology. These include:
• Atmospheric pressure: This refers to the force exerted by the Earth’s atmosphere on a given area.
• Air flow: This is the movement of air across the Earth’s surface.
• Weather forecasting: This is the process of predicting future weather conditions using scientific methods.
• Troposphere: This is the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere and contains most of the weather conditions that affect us.
• Thermosphere: This is the uppermost layer of the atmosphere and contains the ozone layer, which helps protect us from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
• Hydrological cycle: This is the continuous process by which water moves through the Earth’s atmosphere and various land and water surfaces.
• Solar radiation: This is the energy from the sun that causes the Earth’s atmosphere to change.
• Natural disasters: These are events that can cause harm to people and property, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes.
In summary, studying meteorology can help us understand the Earth’s atmosphere and how it affects our lives. This includes understanding weather conditions, atmospheric pressure, air flow, weather forecasting, the troposphere, thermosphere, hydrological cycle, solar radiation, and natural disasters.",322,4,1650

It is the relationship of food and health that makes the task of nutrition and dietetics to ensure that the diet was complete, useful and wholesome. Nowadays nutrition is not seen as a basis for life: even someone who leads a healthy and varied diet, not always come to a good physical form.
In the 20th century food products have changed not as much as it would be desirable, but still many people find themselves unnecessarily. Including insufficient vitamins and minerals. An important role in this problem is played by climate change, physical inactivity and harmful habits. There are many recipes for dissolving lactic acid. Find them you may in Russian, Ukrainian, German, French, Czech, English, Turkish, Hebrew, Spanish and Italian.
Lactic acid is the major source of energy, and its negative effects are significant. Most of its negative effects are due to the fact that the substance does not oxidize, which is detrimental to the body. Here are some facts: First, some foods are too acidic, in this case, passing through the stomach into the intestine, can lead to the fact that they are blocked, as a result of which the protective mechanisms of the intestinal wall are significantly reduced. Such people have fewer opportunities to build up their immune system.
But first of all, the content of lactic acid is related to the digestion, because the organism needs the nutrients, and the lactic acid is not dissolved, which leads to a number of health problems. Of course, not all lactic acid is harmful to the body. Like many other substances, it can be consumed by both humans and other organisms, including such as fish and shellfish. But we want to tell you how to dissolve lactic acid. Therefore, you are the only one who can help yourself. Only you can know what works for your body. The only way to find out the answer is through experimenting, and do not expect for the result right away.
The question of how to dissolve lactic acid is interesting, because it is widely used, is known to man for a long time. For example, manufacturers of these tablets claim that they successfully treat diseases of the eyes, skin and mucous membrane. Moreover, these tablets have a strong diuretic effect. Also, lactic acid can help reduce the level of sugar in the blood. And so on. But be attentive to this issue.

In this post, I want to explain a natural way to think about and understand artificial intelligence, especially as it relates to deep learning, as both a baseline for comparison to what actually works and (as a reference for) what people are hoping for when they say that A.I. should be “more like the human brain.” I’m speaking here about artificial intelligence in the sense of a Turing test, and not (for example) advanced robotics, though an interesting and possibly highly-relevant difference between the two is that of temporal coordination. All this is in line with one of the early, major goals of AI research (as memorably spelled out by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert), namely, “building machines that will have an affinity for intelligent behaviour, learning from experience, and perhaps even passing the Turing Test.” (N.B.: “passing the Turing Test” here is a loose analogy to “being mistaken for human.”) We’ll also touch on why we shouldn’t hope for general intelligence (something we’ve come to think of as human-like), and what role maybe-sentient minds (the parent post is more interesting if you assume that general intelligence means “being a mind” in the same way that everything we see in this world is a “thing” — an important distinction and caveat, to be sure, to be examined more thoroughly later) play in our understanding of what A.I. is, can be, and probably should be. I’ll try to address some common but insiduous points between what is and what isn’t currently considered A.I. Lastly, to mention something we’ll have to address later, even if AI is a fully equi-dimensional representation of the human brain, some element of neuroscience is necessary to understand the brain and its algorithms.

That said, we’ll start by talking about what an A.I. is and isn’t. What an A.I. is and isn’t isn’t (and shouldn’t) really matter to a scientific discussion. We can, for example, exclude all that is obviously not A.I., like the trivial kind that just passes binary truth functions, and define it in terms of its “modes of operation,” but doing so gets into a lot of things we’re still not sure we understand about A.I., including that last point about neuroscience.

1312,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is a science of the beliefs of persons in geology. According to this philosophy, the social history of geology is a history of beliefs.
The history of geology is written entirely from these beliefs.
The sociology of science is not the history of science. Historians of geology are not sociologists of science. Political scientists, biologists, economists, and psychologists study their own specialties; geologists study geology.
Those who thought geology was the last science to be distinguished by its revolutionary advance of the technology of science. In Europe, geology was suddenly recognized as a separate science in 1756, when the German physicist Abraham Werner proposed a detailed sequence of rocks from sedimentary to volcanic. This sequence became a guide to mineral exploration and quarrying. German lawyers in the 1770s began to argue for standards of rock identification in land law. The number of geologists became a topic of political debate. Today more than 75% of geologists are divided into geologists whose scientific research area is their professional specialty, and geologists whose professional interests are in investigating the social history of geology.
Inevitably, as science and technology advanced, two sorts of geologists became prominent. Many geologists worked in separate research laboratories to search for ores, petroleum and natural gas. They worked in unusual parts of the world, in parts of the world that had remained isolated from civilization for long periods of time. They collected specimens and specimens that turned out to be valuable minerals and energy resources. Theirs was a rapid rise in wealth and status.
The other geologists were other geologists, the geologists who found valuable rocks. They found fossil remains for the paleontologists and chemical findings for the geologists who work in minerals and ore deposits. There were many such sub-specialties: petrologists worked on the rare rocks in metamorphic cores; pyroxenologists worked on rocks with X symbol; petrographers searched for fossils. Each professor or research worker could distinguish by his or her own trade of classical geology into the scientific and the expert. All of them were professionally distinguished by the special technical skills with which they faced the identification of rocks and fossils.
In the United States, the geologists of the pioneer era have been recognized as hardworking scientists, imbued with an amateur's love of digging in the earth. They have been remembered as men of culture, men with wide interests in life, men who had time to make and preserve plants, and paint their own famous work",493,4,2643

1315,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," can be heavily debated, but why would someone want to go to college to learn about an art form instead of a science? The argument can be made that society doesn’t often value the skills gained in the majors, such as critical thinking, strong writing and clear communication skills. Instead, it is emphasized that people who study the liberal arts can become teachers or go into a ministry.
Although the liberal arts do sound like a great way to spend a couple of years learning how to entertain and fool yourself in class, science is actually becoming an increasingly valuable commodity. Whether it is a degree in chemistry, physics, math, etc., science can be applied to pretty much any profession.
The skills gained in these degrees can definitely assist someone in a creative field, but learning science will make a scientist.
The world has embraced technology and science to improve it in ways people could have only dreamed of in past generations. It’s all around us; modern medicine, information and communication systems, household appliances and climate control, even water filtration systems. Science keeps these incredible advances within reach, and new advancements are being made constantly, leading to improvements in almost every facet of life.
There are also various careers within these fields that can pay handsomely; you just can’t beat a career in medicine. Scientists can land high paying positions in the industry and can also move into higher education, where their salaries can continue to rise. There are many instances of career growth within the sciences, and this is only a small portion of the possible majors.
As stated, science can be applied to most professions. It’s important to note that there are many career choices for people, especially within the science fields. In the STEM fields, you can have a role as an engineer, chemist, physicist, statistician or programmer. Many of these careers pay well, even in entry level jobs, and they are jobs that people want to have. Basically, if someone wants a career that pays well, they would be smart to take a science major and study hard.
There are many viable career paths within science, and with low unemployment and high pay, anyone interested in a STEM related career would be wise to give it serious consideration.
Now, there are a few people who are comfortable taking an extended hiatus from science while they live off of trust funds and watch a lot of Netflix. Fine, you do you. But for everyone else, college is a place to learn new things and make connections. The idea that there are no careers available for someone who didn’t study a specific major is outdated.

The history of photography dates back to the 16th century when the development of a working camera obscura was discovered. A camera obscura is a dark room or box that has a pinhole or small aperture, allowing light to enter and create an image on the opposite wall. This device has been around for centuries and was later improved upon by Italian physicist Giambattista della Porta in the 16th century.

However, it wasn't until the early 19th century that photography was officially invented. In 1800, French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce captured the first permanent photograph on a pewter plate coated with bitumen of Judea. The process, called heliography, used bitumen as a photographic medium and required exposure to light to develop the image.

Shortly after Niépce's achievement, other French scientists and inventors continued to refine the technique. In 1826, French inventor Louis Daguerre introduced the daguerreotype, a photography method using a silver-coated copper plate. This process became highly popular and provided a more stable image than heliography.

In 1837, William Henry Fox Talbot, an English physicist and chemist, invented the calotype process, also known as the ""negative-positive"" or ""negative-negative"" system. This process produced an image that could be reproduced through the use of(printing) negatives. This was a significant advancement in photography as it allowed for multiple copies of the same photograph.

The 19th century also witnessed significant developments in photographic equipment. In the late 1840s, American photographer Alexander Wolcott invented the first handheld camera, which made photography more portable and accessible. Then, in the 1850s, German inventor Auguste Marie Louis Gustave Adolphe de的照片阻滞下行Acrysin继德Deppe开发了一款新型相机相机,它被广泛认为是世界上第一台真正意义上的相机。 This camera had a lens with a rotating shutter that allowed for exposure times ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes. This camera became extremely popular and is still in use today.

Another significant invention was the dry plate process, which was introduced in 1871 by British photographer Frederick Scott Archer. This process involved using a glass plate coated with a gelatin emulsion and allowed for instant drying, making photography more convenient.

1317,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,": Even after decades of research, we still learn something new. For instance, we can now link a history of lightning to a child’s greater risk for a serious psychiatric disorder.
For nearly 20 years, the ""Great Storm"" of April 27, 2011, is coming to be regarded as a test case to determine the limits of what research can reveal about the effects of extreme weather on people.
Now, psychologists at North Carolina State University have identified one important psychological influence in the storm's aftermath: a child's higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder.
According to a news report by the media services office, the research team led by psychology associate professor Jason Bennett found that past severe storms increased the chances that children had anxiety symptoms at school years later.
""This study is important for two reasons,"" Bennett said. ""First, it helps us identify when the effects of the storm are too long-lasting to be gone or explained by natural changes that occurred between then and the present. Second, it helps us understand some of the psychological consequences of extreme weather, something we previously knew little about.""
The study focused on young children who had exposure to the ""Great Storm."" In April 2011, this category included children who had lived through the storm or nearby counties during the storm's peak, as well as children who had been young children during the storm (2-3 years old) but had not been in any of the storm's impact zones.
Their study of the behavior and attitudes of 802 students from West Virginia public schools, conducted from 2014-16, found that children who had lived in the storm's impact zone exhibited symptoms of anxiety two years later. The same was true for children in the 3- to 5-year-old category, who had been in the storm's path but were not directly hit. The same held for children who had been exposed to the tornadoes, which hit immediately after the storm, but did not themselves actually experience the storm or its aftermath. ""These results indicate that there is a continuous stream of effects when it comes to extremely stressful experiences,"" Bennett said.
""It's clear that this is not just an anxiety disorder that will go away,"" Bennett said. ""This effect is not caused by the trauma of the storm directly, but because of the overall stress that people in the storm’s impact zone endured.
""But since we don't know what emotional components of the storm led to the anxiety effects, we cannot determine if the mood, the physical stress",511,4,2533

Following a recent article by a columnist in The Mercury stating that “fashion design is easy”, Lynn Elling reminds us that style and beauty involve more than meets the eye.
Recently, the Mercury published a satirical article on style and fashion. Some of the statements made by the author may be accurate to the point of being cringe-worthy, but in general I would say that there are some who suffer from an overdose of information, as well as some who suffer from a lack of relevant information, both coming from the fashion and style columnists. These editors are, unfortunately, guilty of embellishing the matter. With all the limitations to what we, the people, are exposed to on a daily basis, the “fashion world” would be very boring if we had more realistic views of what we really want to see, wearing or just admiring. I have to admit the world of fashion styling can be definitely easy. I have said this in my articles as well.
First, before I can proceed with the matter of fashion, I want to share with you some advice I would give to readers that have been influenced by the way the fashion columnists speak or write about their profession and someone they refer to as a great stylist. Having read quite a number of articles written by style and fashion writers, I have some points to share. But the most important ones I have to share are:
• That style is much more than just dressing a person in the right clothes. In fact, it is much more about the idea and about where it is coming from. It also has to do with whatever catches a person’s attention and that makes a person feel good about what they have on, be it from the head to the feet.
• The whole idea is also in your mind, emotions and heart as to why it is you decide to wear the clothes that you are wearing. For example, did you buy the outfit to impress someone else or did you just like the outfit in a magazine?
• With regard to style and dressing, people should know about aesthetics; they should also be aware of the factors influencing them, their lives and their emotional makeup.
• They should also be guided by an array of essential elements that enable them to have the ability to see a style, before knowing that it is, in fact, a style.
• People who are trying to be stylish should study the aesthetics, meaning the form, shape, patterns and colour of a person’s look, which should be in line with the life of the people; their",516,4,2428

Building with good architecture means building a better quality of life. Many homes, communities, and office buildings are designed to be more attractive, safer, more energy-efficient, and affordable to build. In the process, architects work with owners to determine the most effective ways to meet a project's specific goals. Many of today's architects also work closely with other professionals in the building industry, such as engineers, contractors, developers, and government agencies.
Architecture represents much more than simply buildings and land. Architecture has to do with location and space. It is about combining function and aesthetics in harmony.
Architecture also addresses matters of physical space. Examples of architecture as landscape architecture include gardens, parks, and urban plans. A functional aspect of landscape architecture involves the creation of living areas that work for their occupants' needs. Landscape architecture is also about creating a sustainable environment for future generations.
Physical space is also central to the field of architecture. Space refers to the physical distance between objects. Architecture includes the physical manifestation of space in a given design. Good architecture involves designing spaces that serve the most basic human needs. Aesthetics are a part of physical space but not the only element. Space is also concerned with a building's shape, materials, furnishings, color, lighting, textures, and other elements.
The psychological sphere of a building includes its effects on those who use it. A building can affect people in different ways. Sometimes the psychological impact of a building is positive; sometimes it is negative. The architecture should create a harmonious environment for those who occupy the building. This can mean a space that feels comfortable and safe. It could also mean a space that looks beautiful and appealing.
Architecture is also a problem-solving discipline. As a problem solver, architects help solve problems. An architecture plan is an important part of developing a solution to a problem. Without a solid architectural plan, it is difficult to realize the ideal solution to any problem.
There is much that an architecture plan can do for a building. However, the architect's primary role is one of problem solving. It is important for architects to be able to think strategically in order to succeed in solving problems. Strategic thinking helps architects develop creative solutions to problems that will benefit their clients.
In the past, architecture was used to create functional structures for people to live and work in. This practice was called ""architecture architecture."" Nowadays, architecture has expanded to become",518,4,2949

1. Deep Breathing: Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Repeat this pattern for several minutes. 2. Alternate Nostril Breathing: Place your right thumb over your right nostril and inhale through your left nostril for a count",512,4,2550

So which one was right? Yes, both. Both philosophies are right and both are wrong. Which one you choose depends on what you put the emphasis on when you look at the big picture. But there is no right answer, it is not a “this or that” question.
Both pride and gratitude can be extremely useful. Maybe a little of each. If we act like our progress is because of our hard work we can easily miss when someone shows up and gives us the success. This is not a judgement on the attitude of most successful people. Only on a society that forgets to give thanks to their supporters. It is a beautiful and magnanimous act when we notice when people help us and we can be courageous enough to acknowledge it.
This is powerful and mysterious. Some of the powerful events of life don’t seem to be caused by the wisdom of our ancestors, by our surroundings, or any other objective pieces of information that matter. This past me, present me and future me all seemed to be consistently generating the same difficulties. God has a way of paying for it. Our constant pain clears out the clutter from our life, opens up new ways of being, and powers up our character. From the burning bush to a baby in the stable, God is smarter than all the pain in our life and knows what we really need. It is easy to ask ourselves, “How much will God really have to pay before I know I am ready to finally get it right?” Maybe God doesn’t pay, maybe God saves a load of people.

1331,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is long and somewhat convoluted. In our modern day, we can take for granted both the elements and tools that the weather creates. Without the improved technologies that are our everyday, it would be difficult to predict what the weather may be, or what impact those affects may have on our lives and our health.
How Did Technology Affect Meteorology?
Today, when you want the latest weather information about San Jose weather, it’s just a quick click away. Access to the latest data is made easy with the help of the Internet and the ability to quickly communicate with others via the computer and its reliability.
Meteorologists, however, did not have it so easy, and communication wasn’t always so accessible. Between 1850-1900, meteorologists took the best data they could find from various observatories around the world and based it on that. Information from radio sources like shortwave radio, navy ships, railway communications and even telegraph and telephone lines. Then, it was often put into tables, graphs and maps and printed in journals and papers for others to access.
Not until 1893, when Milan Malaguzzi signed a contract with MIT to conduct a long-range weather forecast that measured the differences in barometric pressure from west to east, and that measured the temperature throughout the nation.
Then, in 1898, C.W. Gilbreth, introduced a device which uses a rotating drum mechanism which told the time of day. With this timing, meteorologists and telegraphers had the ability to see how far a storm might go. Not until 1921 with the installation of any sort of radar system. Before this, telegraphers could only use telephone lines, the telephone itself, and letters and messages. Of course, with those, they had to wait to get the messages from the telegram and then relay it to their clients.
We’ve come a long way from the days of paper maps and time charts for checking the weather. And while technology is just a part of meteorology, the application is vast. The use of radar, satellite imagery and computer modeling all are able to produce the data for the meteorologist’s global investigations, and understanding of the weather for all to use.",442,4,2174

The global vernacular architecture has contributed much in its uniqueness and expressive liberty. 23as we move into 21st century we see architectural trends slowly coming in line with structural building blocks and refined technological applications of science and art at the hand of architects. This trend we can take as a forerunner to a new era in the field of architecture which will encompass a holistic approach to environment, rational design, and safe practices. It is indeed an elegant architecture in pursuit of embracing these trends.
The latest ultra-modern architecture project by Emre Arolat Architects, a prominent Istanbul-based practice, is constructed using the latest sustainable and economic construction material of the concrete. Its first phase of the project comprises the master bedroom suite, kids’ lounge and study areas. An elite taste of living would forever be implied in its design that is best expressed in its unobtrusive steps, vaulted ceilings, elegant hallway and master bedroom entrance.
The master bedroom suite area is completely isolated from the rest of the house and is bordered on all four sides by high ceilinged hallways which are extremely responsive to changing climatic conditions. The master bedroom unit is slightly vaulted leading to the bed deck which is somewhat elevated from the others. It is imagined with a pool on its wall surface which is inspired from a Roman-Greek pool’s side panels. This sculptural body feature further expresses the verve of grand living for a more exotic retreat. The Japanese landscapers also collaborated with the architects on the project and the in-house landscape architect supported and directed this project with the eminence of its owner.
The project with its unpretentious design by the perspective of modernity and sustainability brings on a sense of longing for a contemporary Mediterranean lifestyle. The aesthetics of an archaic, Roman luxurious villa style is also subtly emulated in the design. The sense of ostentation in the private space is significantly needed because it holds a common theme of repose, relaxation and rehabilitation in any given situation.",404,4,2203

The development of these two technologies has been advancing at a rapid pace and has a significant impact on various industries. In this essay, we will explore the impact of artificial intelligence on technology and provide examples of its applications. Additionally, we will discuss the ethical considerations that arise from the use of artificial intelligence in technology.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Over the past few years, AI has been integrated into various technologies, including robots, smart home devices, virtual assistants, and self-driving cars.

One of the most significant impacts of AI on technology is the development of intelligent robots. These robots can perform tasks that are too dangerous, difficult, or boring for humans to do. For example, robots can be used in hazardous environments such as oil rigs, nuclear power plants, and space exploration to perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans. Additionally, robots can be used in healthcare to perform surgeries, diagnose diseases, and assist patients in rehabilitation.

Another impact of AI on technology is the development of smart home devices. These devices are designed to make our lives easier and more convenient. For example, smart thermostats can learn our habits and adjust the temperature accordingly. Smart home devices can also be integrated with voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing us to control our home appliances with our voice.

Virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are also examples of AI technologies that have had a significant impact on technology. These assistants can perform various tasks such as setting reminders, making phone calls, and playing music. Virtual assistants can also be integrated with smart home devices, allowing us to control our home appliances with our voice.

The use of artificial intelligence in technology has also raised ethical considerations. One of the main concerns is the potential loss of jobs due to automation. As AI technologies become more advanced, they may replace jobs that are currently performed by humans. Additionally, there are concerns about the privacy and security of our personal data when using AI technologies.

In conclusion, the relationship between artificial intelligence and technology is a complex and evolving field that has a significant impact on various industries. AI has led to the development of intelligent robots, smart home devices, and virtual assistants, and has the potential to revolutionize the way we live our lives. However, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of using AI technologies and ensure that",519,4,2944

or get it signed at the London Chess classic in December or the London Business Book of the year event in April.
Here's my problem, how do you market a book? This is not a unique problem, on the one hand, publishers tell us it's almost impossible to market anything in a book in a way that will make any money back. It's just about getting it out there, and then trust the readers to find it on their own. That's certainly true, but it's incredibly demoralising for a writer not to see anything in the way of tangible benefits from their hard work.
I was talking to my sister a few days ago, who writes web copy and is also an author. She told me that she receives everything in the mail - reviews from libraries, longlisted and shortlisted book awards - with growing disappointment - ""No, no, no, you didn't make it."" I told her that I couldn't, ""poor you"". But really I'm jealous of her.
And the other problem I'm not really sure how to tackle - getting people to notice the book. The first, may be down to being too much of a perfectionist, but I think it's something that people at this time of year just don't want to engage with. How can you market a Christmas book?
But my sister's point still bothers me. You can win all these competitions or awards or whatever (my sister has won quite a few, she's quite good) but it doesn't really make much of a difference. So what can you really get out of all this effort? (By this, I mean the work of trying to get my book to as many people as possible, not the writing).
I have heard so many great arguments for writing books, and the best ones are the ones that make the writer feel that they are doing something great and worthwhile with their life. That's the wrong approach. I'd rather be rich, and nobody can argue that this book is going to make me rich.
So here are the things that I should do to make the book successful. First, I have to buy in advance copies from the publisher. Obviously, it would be great if I could get them at a discounted rate as it would save me from having to spend the cash and become debt ridden, but no. This is a serious business",535,4,2293

To find success with photography you need to have an understanding of the tools at your disposal and knowledge of good photographic techniques. Taking good photographs requires the ability to combine these elements into a cohesive image. Use the following tips to take stunning photographs.
Get as close to your subject as you can. Getting as close to your subject as possible gives you more opportunities to highlight the main subject of the photo, and evade clutter. It lets you zero in on facial expressions, important details like flower arrangements, and other aspects that would otherwise be lost. By simply taking a small step back and framing a larger image, you can immediately get a more striking photograph.
Keep it simple. You should take scenes that are letting your creative side shine through. It is more beneficial to get a shot within the bounds of your hobby and expertise than to take hundreds out of focus pictures of a location.
Adjust the white balance on your camera manually when possible. Fluorescent lighting can cause a yellow hue, so use the appropriate settings when shooting under fluorescent light. You could include some artificial lighting that will not cause a horrible effect.",234,4,1278

The Basics

Pre-requisites: understand Matlab, Java or Python.

Upon completion of this exercise, the participant should be able to:

• use Matlab (run a script, read/write a file)
• design circuits and simulate (develop or use a library)
• understand the simulation mechanics of SPICE
• define cells (static or dynamic)

Standard circuit simulation setup

Circuits are analysed in SPICE using a numerical method. This is rather different from looking at equations in a textbook or solving them by hand. In this sense SPICE is essentially an optical desk calculator.

Using SPICE one can create circuit simulations with a variety of cells (e.g. resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors) and use a combination of these to set up a wide variety of analog and digital circuits (logic gates, combinatorial circuits, sequential circuits, and combinational circuits). In fact any circuit can be simulated provided a numerical solution is known.

In general a circuit can be represented as a set of node voltages (node voltages are the voltages at each node in a circuit). This representation allows us to do things like convert equations relating the node voltages to equations between currents (a voltage drop across an inductor represents a change in current that causes a displacement current, i.e. an inductance is then seen as a resistor and a capacitance as an inductance which is reversed if we transform from voltage to current in the same manner we transform from current to voltage). However we don’t yet have equations relating voltages to currents or capacitors to inductors – this is a problem we need to tackle and in many ways we need the solution in order to design circuits. We represent circuits using these node voltages until we can solve for the currents from equations relating the node voltages. Once we have the equations that can be solved for the currents, we can start to design circuits using these, which is the final solution to this problem. There are a number of ways of doing this, which we will explore here. These are

1. reducing the circuit to an equivalent circuit that does have node voltages in terms of currents.
2. defining the currents in terms of node voltages.
3. The point here is not to to understand all these equations (although these will be defined here) but to realise that there is a problem that we need to solve. Each of these methods tries to solve the problem in different ways and we need to find the best way to",522,4,2479

Federal, state and village leaders began talks in the early 1990's after the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The details of the settlement are worked out over several years. The actual money is set aside in a sovereign trust fund.
This month after years of negotiations the Republic of China begins sending aid to Alaska to fight forest fires in the state. Five million dollars will go to various state agencies for programs to improve fire fighting ability in the state.

Respected colleagues:
The project is at its first stage: at this moment is taking place the first assignment of work and accompaniment of graduates.
Films and Philosophy
Films and philosophy has been the basic training project since 2004.
At this moment, we are in our ninth course. And in this academic year 2017-18, there will be more than 8000 students of the 12th grade (final year of Secondary), come from many schools, all the year around. Thousands of students had already passed through the course, and among them many are already working or studying philosophy in university.
Until now, we had 20 lessons: reading a movie and writing its analysis. Now we are preparing the next stage: a topic and the film students are going to study.
These new courses will be organised differently: the students will choose the movies, and there will be a greater participation of students, so that, among other tasks, they present the movies and the topics during the lessons.
Contents
The first course is an introductory lesson with the titles suggested by the MEC (Ministry of Education) for cultural and popular education in schools and universities, from the Fundación para el Progreso de las Ciencias. All movies dealt with will be free in different video streaming platforms. The schedule will be synchronized with the new grants to the movies that broadcast cinema theatres.
The second course is a wider selection of movies taken by the students: they’ll see the movies they are interested in.

This course will be suitable for anyone who is serious about improving their maths and/or numeracy skills but who hasn't studied maths for a while or who has never studied it before. Don't let ""calculus"" scare you off – we are going to learn from first principles. There are two main reasons for this: firstly you get a complete overview of the subject and secondly the ""rote learning"" of maths skills and knowledge is replaced by ""lifelong learning"" and a desire to create new solutions to real-world problems using mathematics.

The overall structure of this course:

The first 50 weeks of lessons will introduce, clarify and de-mystify, add depth and understanding, and expose you to lots of practical applications to hundreds of mathematics topics and to all the mathematics that you are likely to come across throughout your life.
The next 11 weeks will reinforce and summarize the key principles and offer tutorials in applying the principles to a variety of examples from all disciplines, including physics, astronomy, IT and computers, environmental science, engineering, finance, business, medicine, economics, travel, transport, tourism, and 3D computer graphics applications.
 The entire 61-week course is fully integrated, continually building on the same fundamental principles and concepts, and setting up the remarkable results which your combined understanding will provide.
The content and approach of the course is precisely what I would have wanted when I was a learner. I also cover every aspect of algebra in great detail and provide a tool-set for automating many procedures in analysis and designing solutions.

The practice of sports is vulnerable to injuries; it is influenced by the impacts of external environmental conditions, such as the athletic clothes’ attributes; the complex choreography of each exercise; and user interventions. We have designed and developed a Dance-In-Place prototype, which can evaluate dance practitioners and help them to anticipate technical mistakes, injuries and to promote healthier exercising habits. The Dance-In-Place, inspired by Digital Dance Companion, analyzes the activities of dance practitioners, tracks their dance movements and provides recommendations on training and performance. The prototype supports the internal training of sports practitioners by recording accurate and detailed biomechanical metrics. More importantly, the prototype automates the process of providing real time intelligent feedback, which can be used for injured or overly excited dancers. The Dance-In-Place can be used for assessing and improving the practice of sports, including such athletic activities as sprints and poles’ vault, dance practices such as ballet, figure skating, dance gymnastics, and such sport activities like trampoline gymnastics and walking in unicycle.

1343,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," from its beginnings to current research techniques.
Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, including the brain and its function. It dates back to ancient Greek and Roman times, when philosophers and physicians began to investigate the workings of the brain and the nervous system.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, scholars began to study the brain through experiments and observations. Neurologists such as Jean-Martin Charcot, who treated patients with nerve disorders in France, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal, who made significant contributions to the understanding of the structure of neurons, helped to advance neuroscience.

The discovery of the electron microscope in the 1930s revolutionized neuroscience. It allowed researchers to see structures of cells and molecules that were previously invisible. This led to the identification of new molecules and cellular processes, as well as new insights into the function of the brain.

The mid-20th century saw the development of neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These techniques enabled researchers to study brain activity in living humans, revealing important information about how different regions of the brain work together to control behavior and consciousness.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the field of neuroscience. Researchers are using advanced technologies such as optogenetics, which uses light to activate specific neurons in the brain, and neural implants that can communicate directly with the brain, to study the relationship between neurons and behavior.

Overall, neuroscience has made significant strides in understanding the brain and its functions, and researchers continue to explore new areas of research and technology.

How is neuroscience currently being applied in the field of medicine? Can you give me some examples?
Yes, neuroscience is currently being applied in the field of medicine in numerous ways, and I will provide some examples:

1. Pain Management: Neuroscientists have discovered that the brain interprets pain as a complex sensory experience involving various neural pathways, including the release of various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Studying the brain's response to pain has led to the development of new drugs for pain management that target specific neural pathways.

2. Addiction: Neuroscience has led to a better understanding of addiction, including how the brain’s reward system is affected by substances such as alcohol, drugs, and food. This knowledge has helped develop new treatments for addiction, such as behavioral therapy and medication-based approaches.

3. Parkinson's Disease: The dopamine neurons in the brain that control movement are damaged",516,4,2838

This includes young, technologically-minded students, who have developed programs to help humans colonise Mars. Sure, we know about the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. The technology is still new. In fact, NASA’s Curiosity rover cost billions of pounds. But did you know that many discoveries from space missions have already benefited our lives on Earth? When satellites are used by telecoms companies, we benefit by having telephone calls and emails through the internet. Discoveries made by astronauts help us understand the effect on the planet itself, as well as human beings, of living in space for months at a time. Space agencies are now targeting mission planning to Mars, with a target date of 2030 for astronauts to finally land on the planet, following a journey which could take up to three years. It is still believed to take years of training, and many hours of exercise, before astronauts can leave Earth and make this final trip. So much money must be spent on making sure that the journey is safe. So, given all the high-tech equipment and training, why does it feel as if space exploration is a waste of money? Firstly, people feel that it shouldn’t be the planet’s main concern. Why shouldn’t we put as much effort and money into helping to solve the planet’s real, present problems, like the huge refugee problem caused by civil wars? It seems as though those people are more concerned about astronauts’ personal expenses in space. Astronauts who go to space are on very strict diets, and their food must be prepared and packaged in a very special way. For example, hot food could explode if it is exposed to low pressure. For the US space agency, NASA, by far the most expensive project is the upcoming journey to Mars. At the moment, NASA needs at least $17 billion every year, but even with that, NASA’s projects will run out of money by 2024. It is clear that the planet is heading for disaster. But maybe NASA’s ideas will help. At the moment, most of the power we use comes from burning fossil fuels. This not only pollutes the air we breathe, it also provides about 70% of the energy we use.

Natural vs Technology: Why Are We So Bad With Tech?
Sometimes, we’re just too much of a creature of habit. We always try to stick to what we’ve always known. When we see a ‘new’ (or unfamiliar) piece of technology, our instinct is to check it out and find out what it’s like, if it’s what it promises to be.
There is also this fear of the unknown. Not that there is anything to be scared of with technology, there is just that usual fear of the unknown that we get.
And that could lead us to taking things that have worked in the past for us and trying to fit everything else into that mold, even if it doesn’t work, especially if we fail to understand how and why it works.
Source: ThriveGlobal
There’s nothing inherently wrong about doing this, though. It’s just something we all need to get over. We have to recognize that these new things are different but the underlying principle remains the same.
They are just smaller pieces that together form the same thing. We just need to break them down into their simplest form, then take it from there. As long as we understand the basics, the details don’t matter.
Source: SimplePractice
Simply put, technologies are like natural systems, where everything works together like a watch.
There are things we don’t have control over, which make the work of the humans that make the technology up a bit more complicated. We can’t control things in natural systems, which is why we have to keep a close eye on them.
Just like natural systems, all pieces come together to form the same thing. If we’re not too careful, we end up breaking something in the process. Worse, these kinds of situations come with unpleasant surprises that could have been averted if we had taken a bit of time to stop and think things through.

1349,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," innovation has changed because of Cloud-based services that are shared widely across industries and over computer networks. In a workshop, we explored the ways that technology systems can act like a neural network—a naturally occurring structure that mimics the operation of the human brain. This photo shows examples of brain wiring and parallels with computers, networks, systems and databases.
The workshop, which I gave at the Neuromorphic Engineering Conference last September, explored aspects of the relationship between a technology and a human being, with particular reference to an emotional response to the technology. In this article, I will provide a general overview of the workshop and offer a few reflections. You can find a complete list of references for the talk here.
Neuromorphic engineering, in many ways, is the antithesis of Moore’s Law. Scientists and engineers are striving to create new technologies that are more than the sum of their parts, more than they are in nature. They build these new systems to replicate how the brain works, rather than to optimize computation. They are consciously trying to transcend the efficiency and efficacy that processors demonstrate in more traditional computer science.
Neuromorphic engineering is driven by the desire to discover fundamental principles of nature that we can use to build on. At the Neuromorphic Engineering Conference last year, I talked about one such problem—how to measure an emotional response of a person to a technology. There is plenty of evidence that a person has an emotional response to many things in their life. So, how can one describe and measure such an experience of emotion to make intelligent products that appeal to an emotional response in addition to rationality?
There are some broad differences between technology and people when it comes to emotion. When you use a computer, you really aren’t interacting with the entire processor at once. The processor probably has several hundred to a few thousand cells. In a typical nervous system of an animal of similar brain size, there are something like 100 billion cells. In a person, you really don’t have direct contact with most of their central nervous system. Even in the typical human nerve cell, you have most of the internal machinery, but you don’t see the machinery. For the first time in neuroscience, we have the ability to put a prosthetic sensor in the brain that really wraps around the trillions of connections of an animal’s nervous system. Such a system allows us to feel and sense subtle changes inside another brain, without changing the animal in a way that would affect it’s behavior. A sensor like this will inform me about a person",520,4,2708

The first part of this workshop will be focussed on the development of students’ understanding of astronomy, and on addressing some of the big questions that underpin the subject, such as ‘What is the Universe made of?’. It will also identify barriers to students’ learning in this area. These will include issues such as how teachers get accurate information about the questions that are being explored in schools and colleges, but also difficulties they experience in using this information effectively with their students.
The second part of the workshop will focus on some of the activities that teachers can use with students to address these issues and provide an enjoyable, memorable and educational experience. These are based on long-standing research and the evidence it provides. But they also include a range of pedagogic techniques, including inquiry- and enquiry-based learning, as well as the latest thinking about how best to develop students’ collaborative problem solving skills. They can be used in conjunction with any astronomy course, at any level, as well as with science students who are interested in pursuing careers in the space sector.
Dr Paul Harrison is a researcher and teacher with a particular interest in the development of students’ understanding of astronomy. He has been extensively involved in curriculum development and teacher education, including being the lead developer of the A Level astronomy course for the Open University, and an author of the Secondary Physics Department’s manuals for resources and lesson planning for A Level astronomy and GCSE science. He has supervised several undergraduate, Masters and PhD students researching different aspects of astronomy education, and is Director of Studies of the MSc course in Science Education within the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Oxford Brookes University.
Dr Harrison is a former Senior Teaching Fellow at the Open University where he worked on the Open Learn astronomy project, managing a team of authors and researchers responsible for developing online open educational resources for use in schools. He developed a learning resources web site for both university and state secondary schools (https://www.astro-school.net.uk), which was commissioned and widely used by national and international groups as a resource for use in professional development. This won the Times Higher Education Supplement award for Most Innovative Course and was recognised as one of the first 15 examples of Innovation in Teaching and Learning globally by the American Council on Education in 2010.

In this colloquium, we will examine the cultural politics of literature, with an emphasis on its comparative, transnational, and diasporic dimensions. Our discussion will move through a range of topics and figures, including social realism, mass culture, alternative histories, and censorship. In each case, we will aim to demonstrate and explore the possibilities for theory-building that emerge through a distinctly transnational or diasporic perspective.
This workshop will take a comparative approach to approaches to nationhood and ethnicity, and the relationship between the two. How do new institutions and discourses legitimize new forms of nationalism? What narratives of the past are used to justify nationalist claims? Are all forms of nationalism identical, or are some nationalisms more exclusionary or self-consciously national? Are nation-states truly homogeneous? We will cover topics such as new institutions, such as ethnic cleansing as ethnic nationalism and the role of women in and by the state, distinctions between diaspora, diasporic nationhood, and secession, and comparisons of culture versus ethnicity, so as to understand the afterlife of a nation after a given ethnic boundary has been drawn. From Kenneth Waltz and Samuel Huntington to Charles Tilly, and from Mark Weitzman and Stuart Hall to Anthony Smith, we will consider how different models of nationalism have been used, challenged, and debated. Additionally, from Said Arjomand, Abu-Lughod, Anderson and Winichakul, we will consider discourses and attempts at nationalism that have been deployed at various sites of contestation.
The goal of this course is to discuss the recent debates in the study of Latin American history and society. In recent decades, Latin American history has undergone a number of important transformations. We will place these transformations in the context of the cultural history of the discipline, but our main focus will be on the scholarship produced by scholars working in the area. Particular emphasis will be placed on comparative questions, often within the scope of the Latin American region but sometimes against other global regions. Throughout the course, we will explore a number of problems and methodological issues. Some will center on more traditional questions, but others will focus on more recent methodological debates.

Use descriptive language to convey the flavors and textures of each ingredient, and consider incorporating sensory details such as smell and texture to enhance the reader's experience. Perhaps your character learns about a new ingredient culture or tradition and attempts to replicate a dish or cooking method using uncommon ingredients. Describe the challenges they face and how they overcome them, or perhaps the joys of discovering a new ingredient or technique that changes their entire perspective on cooking. Ultimately, showcase the power of food to transcend cultural barriers and broaden one's horizons. Growing up in a small village in the mountains, I had never really encountered any exotic ingredients. So, when I moved to the city and was offered a job as a chef, I was shocked to see my first shipment of insects. Butterflies, ants, and beetles were among the items I had to cook with. At first, I was hesitant, but I soon realized that these small creatures had a unique taste and aroma. Working with them was a challenge, but I was determined to find a way to cook them to my taste.

One day, I decided to create a dish using these insects, and I called it “the Dancing Queen”. The dish was a mix of roasted ants, beetles, and beetles’ larvae, seasoned with herbs and spices. The butterflies’ wings added a delicate crunch to the dish. To complement the sweetness of the insects, I added some bitter greens, like chicory, to the mix. The fragrance of the dish was incredible: it was both floral and earthy, with a hint of spice. It was a challenge to balance the flavors, but I felt like it was worth it.

The next time I cooked with insects, I tried a different dish, a spaghetti with “the midnight cook’s” legs. The “midnight cook” is a kind of large spider, and the dish was a warm mix of lentils, spices, and “midnight cook” legs. The taste was quite remarkable: a unique combination of earthy and spicy flavors that blend in perfectly. The texture of the dish was also quite interesting: the “midnight cook” legs were crunchy, yet the flavor was smooth and delicate.

At first, I was hesitant to cook with these strange and unfamiliar ingredients. But, the more I worked with them, the more I realized how much they had to offer. It was like a whole new world had opened up before me, and I was excited to explore it",512,4,2448

A more harmonious relationship between people and nature will follow from a complete trans-formative convergence that combines concepts from ecology and ethics to merge wisdom from nature, human nature, and ethos. Disregard of human presence, totally removed from human values, values free systems would seriously affect and skew the outcomes of biological ethics. Biomedical advances, neurobiology, cloning, genomics, pharmacology, and reproductive technologies are greatly influenced by what we can learn from studying animals, especially in the areas of mechanistic level details of how natural living systems work and what would then be the lessons that can be brought forward into human health. The study of biology is far different than that of philosophy in that biology must understand self-organized systems and the concepts of tolerance, adaptation, and plasticity, not just reductionism and interconnectedness. By developing greater understanding and establishing a concept of wisdom based on self-organized systems it might be possible to promote more ecologically appropriate and harmonious technologies and remove many of the destructive aspects that often are employed. Interdisciplinary education can help individuals understand how the concepts of systems and homeostasis can promote greater understanding, good science and wisdom in the fields of biology, medicine, and society.

1. Prehistoric Times: 
Human interaction with wildlife dates back to prehistoric times when humans lived in harmony with nature. People have used animals for food, clothing, and shelter since ancient times.

2. Medieval Times: 
During this period, people relied heavily on hunting and trapping for their survival. Wildlife conservation was largely unorganized, and many species suffered greatly from overhunting and habitat destruction.

3. Renaissance: 
During the Renaissance period, Europeans began to explore and colonize new lands, and this led to an increase in wildlife exploitation and habitat destruction. Many species were hunted to near-extinction, and some species, such as the Bengal tiger, became near-extinct.

4. Industrial Revolution: 
The Industrial Revolution led to widespread urbanization and industrialization, which significantly altered ecosystems. Many people began to view wildlife as a commodity, leading to widespread hunting and poaching.

5. 20th Century: 
The 20th century witnessed significant developments in wildlife conservation. In 1900, President Theodore Roosevelt became the first President to speak out for conservation, setting in motion a series of national parks and monuments. In 1939, the National Wildlife Refuge System was established to protect important wildlife habitats.

6. 21st Century: 
The 21st century has seen a renewed focus on wildlife conservation. Many conservationists have focused on reducing the impact of human activities on wildlife and their habitats, including climate change, habitat loss, and pollution.

Notable conservationists:
1. John Muir: A Scottish-American naturalist, conservationist, and author, known for his advocacy for preserving wilderness areas.

2. Aldo Leopold: An American ecologist and environmentalist who pioneered the concept of ecological restoration.

3. Rachel Carson: A marine biologist and conservationist who popularized the idea of environmentalism with her book ""Silent Spring.""

To get you up to speed on quantum mechanics, we're going to start with a little wave mechanics, which will help to clarify why we need quantum mechanics, and why it has the strange features it has.
The idea of a wave-mechanical model for matter is very old. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460 BCE–370 BCE) believed that ""atoms"" had zero size, that the substance of the universe was composed of atoms, and that the laws governing the atoms were those of pure geometry. The atoms were coherent light with slightly varying wavelengths and frequencies. The world consisted of expanding and contracting harmonics, invisible phenomena with inner structure, and those phenomena governed by an inner clock. Democritus' idea was that the diameter of a tiny piece of material, like a grain of sand, would be infinite, like the diameter of the universe. A photon, like a wave, vibrated at the atomic level, moving from one atom to another atom, in a cloud of atoms. Light passed through each atom.
Democritus' idea was like that of Newton and Darwin. For a long time, it seemed like a good enough idea. We knew a lot of things, but we didn't know how to describe them. So we had an idea, but didn't know why the idea was wrong. What did we know? We knew some things:
Sometimes, even if you don't have enough photons to create an atomic wave, the atoms are in a non-local, classical wave state. When we know their position, we can use classical geometric methods to figure out what they are doing. (E.g. superconducting wave fields, where the atoms are in a quantum state, and the electrons in a superconducting ring can use this to do quantum bits of information.)
We know that when light waves and charged particles interact, they behave in a way that is similar to classical optics and classical electromagnetism. But this is just coincidence: light and charged particles in a vacuum are both governed by the same laws (although we can think of them as being different kinds of things). In a vacuum, you can do classical physics and still get the right answer, but it's not perfect. So you can't take a beam of charged particles, and assume that it is going to behave like a beam of light, because it won't behave like it. We call this ""elementary particles,"" the particles that have a",521,4,2340

This article uses the philosophy of language in general and semantic analysis of literature in particular to propose a new approach to literary theory through which we can consider the difference between ""fiction"" and ""humor"" in literary writing. This article analyzes the two writing genres through both deductive and inductive approaches. One the one hand, it presents a sample of representative humorous writing. On the other hand, it applies linguistic and stylistic techniques to determine different differences in general and humorous linguistic structures. Through the deductive and inductive procedures, it is shown that there is a significant difference between fiction and humor, and therefore we can conclude that humor is a specific category in the realm of literature that has its own semantic structure. Through the approaches of this analysis, we show that the Humor of Literature can have a dialectical feature, showing an independence of itself from the concept of fiction. In other words, we use this analysis to construct a new approach, based on the philosophy of language and literary semantics, in which we can distinguish between fiction and humor with respect to their own structures and features, showing the validity of the Humor of Literature in terms of considering its own structure independent of fiction.
This essay examines the experimental cinema of Sun Xun and explores how his use of CGI creates a metaleptic density in both the theoretical and narrative dimensions of animation. Highlighting the mutable nature of the cinematic image, Xun utilizes the complexity of the animatic to draw attention to the physical nature of film itself. He critiques the shared notions of censorship and commercial culture that interfere with the creation of an independent, authentic relationship between visual imagery and sound. This essay culminates with a brief conversation with Xun and director/producer Terry Gilliam.

I've been studying cryptography for a few months now, and while it's deeply fascinating, I was at a loss as to why I should care about it. After reading about security frameworks and standards, I'd come to realize that cryptography would be the missing piece of the puzzle in verifying the security and integrity of communications. But knowing about the internal workings of cryptography hasn't made it any more clear how it will be of value to me.

My motivation in writing this article is to illustrate why cryptography is significant, and how it is needed in the increasingly data driven world we live in. This is not a cryptography tutorial, and I'm certainly not an expert, I simply wanted to share what insights I've been able to accumulate about a field I find to be very intriguing.

## Communication Channels and Protocol Integrity

Perhaps the core idea of cryptography is that it is about using mathematics to ensure communication integrity. The figure below, from section 2 of Applied Cryptography, illustrates this nicely. For clarity, imagine an email is being sent over an unsecured network. Consider the following protocol: the user enters their login information, which is sent to a server. The server decrypts the username and compares it with the one in the identity document. If they match, the user is granted access. It is essential that this protocol be secure, for if an attacker could somehow intercept the username, they could masquerade as the user. This is the basic concept behind modern cryptography.

### Malicious Servers

The security of such a protocol may seem obvious, given this example, but in reality, malicious servers are a very real threat. Imagine an email going through the following processing sequence: the sender encrypts the username, the mail server encypts the email and sends it to the receiver's mail server, and the recipient receives the email and decrypts the username and compares it to the valid username stored in the database of the recipient. If they do not match, the recipient can report the mail server to the authorites.

While the username is being sent over the network, the user has no knowledge of the mail server. The mail server could intercept the username and decrypt it with its own private key. Additionally, the mail server could intercept the user's password. Without knowledge of these, the user's email would be read by the mail server but the user would not be able to access it.

### Integrity

As a gardener, I would like to stress how important it is to consider the ethics of harvesting. The most important message is that harvesting does not have to be destructive, although some gardeners may not see it that way.
Traditionally, strawberries are harvested in the UK by manually hand-picking. This removes the blossom as well as the fruit. This is permissible in certain circumstances; however, if there are many wild flowers (or any crops) present that are pollinating for their purpose, it is seen as an aggressive practice and can result in long term damage to the environment. Additionally, if there are perennial plants present, harvesting them excessively is an act of environmental vandalism that is morally and ethically wrong.
Some gardeners may argue that biodynamic (1) farming means the farmer is not dealing with nettles so ethically I should be able to remove everything. However, many fruit and vegetable crops are successful in my garden with just 1 square metre. Given that there are countless weeds to replace them with, it does not make financial sense to destroy overgrown fields in my view. Furthermore, it does not make sense ethically to destroy perfectly healthy plants, and by doing so deprive others of their use.
In truth, gardening can be stressful because the demands on the environment are even greater than usually thought. The garden and gardeners should be an example of ‘intensive, minimal intervention’ land use and not an aggressive and wasteful activity.
(1) The word biodynamic is not used in the United Kingdom because it would conflict with national standards of organic farming and the Organic Food链认证. In the UK, organics need to be certified by a non-government organisation that is registered with the EU.",372,4,1809

The most prominent of these young men are known by their oppositional titles, given to them by their academic disciplines: the poets, the philosophers and the scientists. They've also spawned mythical figures of the ages past. And there you'll find your mad scientists and gifted children. It's no wonder, then, that there's an arrogance attached to all of this knowledge: How far can you go into philosophy? Can you make a device that can change the macroscopic world? How far in to mathematics? How far in to the microcosm and the microphysics? What new doctrines can you bring to the table? Can you command the forces of the unseen?
They have their conventions, their rivalries and their politics, just like every other intellectual. Yet they seem strangely uninterested in the curiosity of ordinary folks about their work. Philosophers may have started The Protectors (gathering a subset of their most elite for very odd purposes), but that doesn't mean they care all that much about their layman public. Nor do their scientific or poetic counterparts. Truth is, given how intellectual this culture is, there's only so far down the rabbit hole their curiosity can go. Yet the lofty views, ethical precepts and cunning manipulations of this culture give its citizens a large breadth of possible experiences and escapes from the world. (The exceptions among them are there to show that there are flaws to the whole construct, and in their selfishness or personal follies make for fantastic stories.) The Protectors particularly are keen observers of the curious and boastful streak of scientists, poets and philosophers alike: A level of self-promotion and grandiose posturing which make them targets of societal mockery. And they all use ruthless machinations to cull the unworthy from the herd, leaving only those who truly are in their field for the purpose of demonstrating their worthiness.
Foundlings are as or more valuable to this city as they are any other, which is another way of saying that most of them live in abject poverty. There are some who profit from the hopes of others; these mad, foppish loons of philosophy, poets and scientists count on this outpouring of idealism, as it fuels their ambitions and serves as the basis for the price of most unlikely innovations. But the lads of blue, as the Foundlings are affectionately known, have their share of heroes. Like their Greek relatives, even Foundlings have heroes. The curse of their technology",524,4,2536

In the left example a uses the public key $k$ to decrypt the message $m_1$ he sent to b. In the right example b uses the private key $k$ to encrypt the message $m_2$ he sent to a.

What exactly is the relationship between the $k$ in the two examples? In the first example the $k$ isn't used to encrypt anything - only decrypt. In the second example $k$ is the only thing sent that actually has a relevant role. This isn't really making sense to me as I feel like $k$ should be in all of those messages for any meaningful meaning to be achieved. What am I missing? Actually, I am getting more confused by this.

This block diagram may help to visualize it. Remember that the inner layers perform the function of a simpler version of the block - eg, the inner layers of a Stream Cipher perform the function of the simpler Stream Cipher.
In the first case, you've got a block of ciphertext ""generated"" (or decrypted) by the outer Key Block, and this ciphertext was not generated directly from the plaintext - it was generated from a stream of plaintext (i.e. the Key Stream) and an outer ""random"" stream of ciphertext ($k_0,k_1$ in the diagram).
In the second case, you have an inner block of plaintext which is first ""seeded"" from the outer Key Block and then enciphered with the inner Key Stream. The ciphertext is generated directly from the plaintext and not from any (random) ciphertext.
Ultimately this has nothing to do with RSA and is based on a secret key stream being used to generate the plaintext - the process of key generation in this case is the ""encryption"" and the process of plaintext generation is the ""decryption"".",410,4,1661

I had always wanted to be an actor ever since I was a little girl. My parents were both in the theater, and I would spend hours watching their rehearsals and performances. When I was 10 years old, I decided to audition for my first play, a small community theater production of ""Cinderella.""

At the audition, I nervously walked up to the stage, the spotlight shining bright on me. I tried my best to make a good impression, but I wasn't sure what to expect. I found out a few weeks later that I had made the cut, and I was excited to start rehearsals.

As we worked on the play, I quickly found that there were very specific rules and expectations for the actors. We had to dress a certain way, speak a certain way, and learn lines and movements quickly. I found that I struggled with these expectations and felt like I was constantly conforming to what everyone else wanted.

One day, I found myself in a conflict with the director about how one of the scenes should be played. I argued that my interpretation of the scene was different and that it should be changed. The director was not pleased and told me that I needed to conform to the vision he had for the play.

As the rehearsals continued, I felt like I was losing my individuality and creativity. I couldn't help but feel like I was just another cog in the wheel, and not an individual who could bring something unique to the play.

Finally, opening night arrived. I was anxious and nervous. As I stepped out on the stage, I could feel the energy of the crowd and the weight of their expectations on my shoulders. But then, something happened. As the play progressed, I started to find my own interpretation of the script and my own unique choices of line delivery and movement. I began to feel like I was finally being heard, and that my individuality was valued.

As the play drew to a close, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I realized that while it was important to follow certain guidelines and expectations, it was also important to have the courage to share my own vision and interpretation of the piece. In the end, it was my individuality and creativity that made the play shine and made it memorable.

The play was a success, and I knew that I had found my calling as an actor. I also knew that it was important to always find a balance between individuality and conformity",510,4,2473

Oceanography is crucial to understanding our relationship with the oceans. This article explores the significance of oceanographic research in our modern world and gives examples of how it can help address some of the critical issues affecting the planet.
Importance of oceanography in our modern society
The oceans are the largest and most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They cover nearly two-thirds of the world’s surface, and their circulation plays an essential role in regulating Earth’s climate. Oceanography is the study of the oceans’ physical, chemical, and biological processes and their interactions with the planet. With such vast bodies of water, it is not surprising that oceanography is one of the fastest-growing fields of study in the world.
Oceanography provides the necessary basis for addressing global challenges such as climate change, natural hazards, food security, and ocean energy.
The oceans are a critical component of global weather patterns
Oceanography has a profound impact on weather forecasting and climate change. Oceanography can provide the basis for accurate forecasting of extreme weather events like hurricanes and typhoons. As well as providing data on the ocean’s surface temperature, which influences weather patterns.
Oceanography provides us with data to better understand climate change
The oceans are a crucial component of global weather patterns. And they play an essential role in regulating the planet’s climate. Oceanography provides essential data for climate research. The oceans absorb heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and changes in ocean temperature and pH can significantly impact climate patterns. For instance, according to scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, “The oceans absorb nearly 80% of the energy imbalance caused by global warming” (Burlakova & Kaminski, 2020).
Oceanography can predict climate change
Oceanography can predict climate change by measuring changes in the temperature of the oceans. Oceanography provides us with data to better understand climate change. With an accurate understanding of how climate is changing, we can develop strategies to mitigate its effects.
Oceanography provides us with a means to address natural hazards
The oceans are prone to natural disasters such as tsunamis, storms, and hurricanes. Oceanography can provide a means of mitigating the impact of such events. For instance, it can warn us of impending storms and help us better prepare for them. With this information, communities can take steps to evacuate their populations, protect critical infrastructure, and save lives.
Oceanography can help us address food security issues
The oceans are a critical source of food, and oceanography can provide us with the knowledge to ensure their sustainability",507,4,2790

CHALLENGES OF SPORTS COVERAGE IN A DIGITAL WORLD
Kenny Irby March 23, 2016 January 22, 2017
ABC's 2015 Baseball pregame coverage comes into view on a dramatic divided screen above the sports desk, in- sync with the synchronized cadences of the two voice-only anchors. “It’s only the 16th time since 1908 that a World Series team has won 4 games on the road.” The hard angle is set to low-key, medium-diffusion light — reminiscent of those old picture of Walter Cronkite in his office.
Suddenly the anchor realizes what he just said — no sound goes with it, only a drumbeat of end-points to an illustration of the ending. The anchor looks away, and the legs of his chair rise, a colleague’s legs rise, and Ken Singleton's legs rise. Then Singleton is uncorked, manfully. Singleton offers a musing on sports and manners. The “raised chair legs” motif is used to good effect. Viewers digest his comments as he speaks to the empty chair at the head of the desk.
While there is no play-by-play, sideline reporter Mark Schlereth is not totally quiescent. He offers a beat- by-beat analysis of the gridlock moments. He offers an “I will take the Giants here” over the weatherman’s “High pressure” forecast. Schlereth’s symbiotic work with Singleton appears good to.”
When we break down this scene, three major points come to mind:
1. The divide screen was a challenge for the three person anchoring team.
2. The desk, chairs, lights and set didn’t work well — the whole table just seemed awkward.
3. The energy wasn’t spectacular, and the focus was on the pitch.
So, not the best sports programming, except at one point during the broadcast when an A-list anchor and analyst had a moment to shine.
The point of this is not to knock ABC’s World Series telecast, but rather to examine a very important question for those of us who cover sports for local television stations. When we are asked to cover this seemingly 24/7 phenomenon, what should our pre-game strategy be, now that the rise of social media has sent the traditional pre-game show out to pasture? How will we succeed in planning our approaches and deliver compelling, relevant sports content?

However, the reality shows that a good percentage of students have limited theater experience, are not familiar with theater skills and are not interested in learning about drama. This paper studies the method in which students are first drawn and then trained to integrate theater into their existing learning. During the training process, students are guided to make practical things, such as poetry reading, calligraphy reading and poetry recitation, into theater activities and put them on the stage, so as to enrich the learning content. The method has achieved good results for people of different ages and in different studies.
The goal of modern education in China is to train qualified and qualified talents to serve the country in various aspects. The education of children, especially young people, is the cornerstone of national education. It can be said that the quality of the education of young people has a profound impact on the development of Chinese society and is a major task for educators.
Chinese education has always been “a blend of three disciplines” of science, humanities and art, and emphasizes scientific disciplines as the core of education, while emphasizing humanities and art education. In a certain sense, humanistic and artistic education is the cradle of all kind of learning and all kinds of industries. It contains everything from image and movement, literary and artistic experience, to imagination, creation and pleasure. In general, the arts cultivate the emotions, cultivate the spirit of beauty, cultivate a harmonious atmosphere, cultivate human wisdom and moral education, and cultivate taste and appreciation. The nature of humanistic education is to teach students to understand art, experience art, feel art and enjoy beauty.
In the process of humanistic education, dramatic teaching is an indispensable part. Through drama teaching, students cultivate a good atmosphere of thinking and inquiry, good experience of life, beauty of taste, rich imagination, cultivate their self-esteem and self-confidence, cultivate their own spiritual potential, encourage their students to self-confidence and free spirit, thus In the cultivated environment, young people truly, really and deeply realized “play and life are no different, or like a light, the role of a whole life”, that is, the living is the play, and the play is the living, and learn from experience, to act as a medium, to recover the truth of human existence, and explore the nature of life and human life.

Most archaeologists work in teams, each with their own special roles and contributions to the work and learning of others. These roles may be chosen freely by the archaeologist, or may be assigned based on individual skills and experience.
The work of an archaeologist can change with the shifting research interests and funding priorities of the Institution or governmental project. Additionally, external circumstances may require a change of direction or even project interruption. The same is true for the archaeologist as the picture of the past is constantly changing. The past we learn about is made up of events from the distant past through the present. But as we become more educated and technologically advanced, we are able to learn more about the past and preserve the evidence of it. This extends our reach into the past and increases our understanding of ancient communities, cultures and technology. It also impacts how we continue to work in the present and may not impact the archaeologist unless they are deeply interested in the wider ramifications of cultural trends.

The term robot has been in use since the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1920s, the term was in use to denote science fiction automaton with seemingly human-like characteristics such as Isaac Asimov's robotic ""fantastic"" robot in the science fiction stories ""Liar!"" published in 1941 and ""Runaround"" published in 1942. Asimov later coined the name of the Three Laws of Robotics. In 1942, the robotic android ""Robbie"" was featured in the science fiction film ""Fantasia of Terror"". The term has been in use in science fiction pulp magazines throughout the 1940s. They were inspired by the scientific determinism of early science fiction writers such as H. G. Wells and with the historical preoccupation with humanoid automata of pre-television era science fiction authors.

In the 1950s, Isaac Asimov introduced the concept of an automaton that could perform physical tasks autonomously. These days, people also tend to think that a computer will be needed for a robot to do its task.

In reality, it is usually not a necessity for a robot to use computer technology for doing its job. Many robots, for example automobile factory robots, are not computer controlled, they do their task mechanically and usually quite slow. An example of non-computer based robots are one axis industrial manipulator arms.

Even if a robot must do its job fast, it doesn't have to use computer technology: A chain reaction of moving discs and pendulums can serve the same purpose. But sometimes it's necessary to use computer technology, in order to make a robot learn from its environment.

Probably the most common misconception about robotics is that a robot is simply a machine which can do things without human assistance. This depends on a definition of the word robot and it is the same definition we use in our talks.

One definition of a robot includes three laws or characteristics:
- a robot can act without any human assistance,
- a robot can see its environment,
- a robot can process its environment to find the best course of action.
An often used terminology is the term perception-action-loop to show how a robot performs its action on its environment by using its sensors to gather information and trying to use that knowledge to control its physical actions.

Actually, nowadays it is a tendency to define robots in a very different way, e.g. an articulated arm",492,4,2424

Garden centres will open in Scotland on 29 March, meaning that those who love plants and gardens will be able to get gardening supplies, meet up with friends and have a natter over the fence or gaze at our beautiful borders.
The hard work begins now, of course, and there are a few things you can do in advance of opening your first seed packet to ensure that your garden looks its best for when this vital industry opens.
Below are a few tips to get you started:
Pick a spot
So where should your new garden be, and will you have the time to take care of it? Ideally, your garden should be accessible all year round, particularly during the winter months. Look at the wind and frost patterns from the windows, and what extra protection such as fences or hedges you need for wildlife. If you are going to plant fruit trees, will they be able to access sunlight? Do you want a fully-fledged vegetable plot or to include planting herbs in pots or raised beds? We recommend planning your garden and garden diary on paper, not on your phone – you will be able to have much more room and not get bogged down.
Design and layout
Try to imagine how you would like the area to look and feel, and the type of garden you want. You may have a hillside with mostly sunny areas and other areas in shadow. Think about the plants you might choose for these. Make a plan with the area you need to use in mind and then decide how to divide it up, with raised beds and veg beds if necessary. It is always a good idea to make sure you include pathways or a path to water features, such as a bird bath or pond.
Choosing plants
Use your design to ensure you consider what would look best in your garden, and that the plants you choose will grow to fill the allotted space. Choosing a plant that is half the size you think it is when it is mature is not going to look great, and you will not have much of a garden! You should also choose plants that have a low maintenance level so that you will have more time to spend gardening. If you are unsure about the plants you want, take a look at our new RHS Grow Your Own initiative, which has a range of gardening advice as well as how to turn your back garden into a growing space.

(One of these is; two camera set ups placed directly opposite each other, each camera filming different scenes at the same time, both pictures shown as a “single projection.”, and “The Optical Illusion”!)
Bob Avery said : There is a 180 degree rule and a 135 degree rule. The 135 degree rule is when a director wants to show one character to another character looking directly at them over the shoulder of the third character, the 180 degree rule is when the person you are looking at is behind you with the other character behind the first character with that character looking in your direction over the shoulder of that character.
Waldo Answers: you are very new to Cinematography.

There is no *rule* that two cameras have to face opposite one another. My alma mater has three-camera studios that face in different directions, the fourth being operated remotely by a camera operator located in a back corner of the studio. The lighting of a back wall is usually pitched slightly into the screen, so that you cannot see the fourth camera easily when you're shooting anything from that location.

The 135 degree ""rule"" is well supported by design, but most production companies can't afford it. Most non-studio lighting is intended to be directed in a shallow zone. The purpose of ""over the shoulder"" coverage is to let the viewer ""sit"" alongside the characters who are talking. And that involves the viewer having access to the actor they're looking at.

In *Ace Venture: Pet Detective* (1994) Jim Carrey keeps telling a man named Frank to ""shut up!"" A camera pulls back, revealing that Frank is sitting right next to the window, as Carrey deliberately has Frank look at Carrey from behind. With Frank ""out of the way"" the shooting was easier.

In *Daredevil* (2003), the supporting characters get that shallow-window lighting and Carrey doesn't. The over-the-shoulder coverage is limited because the movie wants to show Matt Murdock working with Foggy and Karen and with other supporting characters. ""Shallow"" on the character, but not on the window. It took a lot more time and effort, but the result is more an ensemble movie than the overly-focused movie ""Ace"" was.",470,4,2226

Use resistance machines, free weights, and some body-weight exercises. Start with lower weights and lighter repetitions for each exercise and then try to increase the weight and repetitions as soon as possible. Keep in mind the 80/20 workout principle that when you perform 80% of the exercises with proper technique and 20% of the exercises with little or no technique you will probably get the best results. Try to maintain an elastic, relaxed and loose body, so that you are able to do all the movements with ease, without any tension in the muscles. Try to make the movements from the stomach as opposed to making the movements from the hip flexor muscles, such as in “Squats” or “Jumping Jacks”.

Climate change and rising water temperatures are threatening marine and coastal ecosystems. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its Pacific Island Regional Collaboration Center have called for support in addressing ocean acidification (OA) through education, outreach, and research. OA is an indicator for carbon (CO2) emissions from burning fossil fuels, and each carbon molecule absorbed by seawater makes the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals and other marine invertebrates to form their shells.
Through a U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) agreement, the partnership’s project is exploring ways to deliver NOAA’s OA science findings from a centralized data storage location, while making the data available to NOAA and its offices and available to other researchers. The first phase of the project began in March 2012 and included project initiation, developing operational procedures and requirements, identifying effective OA datasets and outputs, and establishing data storage locations. The next phase, beginning in May 2013, will involve collaborative cartographic and mapping applications and data processing, which will allow more dynamic and complete assessments of OA distributions.
Best use of the data can be demonstrated through the Life in the OA Data Map. Check out this service for global models and distribution information for OA marine species and ecosystems.

Introducing the new journal series ‘Beyond Choreographer Management’…
Non-Classical World: Mapping an Artist Matrix
Ballet companies produce ballets. Dance companies produce dance. Theatre companies produce theatrical pieces (plays, musicals, cabaret performances) and/or dance pieces. Non-classical companies produce a myriad of outputs, thus, by necessity their systems of artist-management demand a diverse and sophisticated approach. Indeed, each company requires its own entrepreneurial and unique management strategies in order to produce its events successfully. All our case study companies are well-established and commercially successful. There can be no such thing as a generic approach. However, our research reveals commonalities in production and organisational systems across these industry. This journal series aims to contribute to the understanding of how companies and productions can be successful, but is not primarily concerned with issues of artistic quality and repertoire selection. In fact, we do not include any case studies of this specific content.
How these case studies can help you
Our aim is to provide you with an insight into the large variety of ways in which new media and projects have been established. The fact that most case studies are written by experienced professionals, working in high-level international ballet and contemporary dance companies, gives a more realistic view on how business is done today, where innovation and change are key factors for survival and success.

From chance discoveries in bioorganic chemistry and synthetic biology, have emerged several widely used classes of drugs. These are general compounds with activity towards a wide variety of targets, i.e., ""biosurfactants"". Some of these include monoclonal antibodies, peptide hormones, enzyme inhibitors, immune system modulators, and anti-bacterial, antiviral and other drugs. If used in combinatorial and synthetic forms these drugs are referred to as bioconjugates.
However, the nature of conjugation approaches is rather diverse and many bioconjugation methodologies are now used on a clinical scale. This book covers this wide range of bioconjugation methods, including the newer trends in synthetic biology and site specific conjugations.
A huge variety of bioconjugates are covered and the various chemicals are reviewed in such a way that the reader can easily recognise and apply these methods in their research. The book is accessible and easy to read making the complex idea of bioconjugation highly accessible for anyone interested in this area.

One key skill in cognitive neuroscience is knowing how to make connections between different pieces of information or between different disciplines. An effective way to support this kind of connection is to provide examples that may differ drastically in their origins but at the same time, may reveal essential information or take one to another by stimulating many different experiences. In this paper, we present an example that explores different neuroscience concepts and experimental methods. In particular, it introduces two women who have taken different paths through neuroscience. One is a computational neuroscientist who explored human visual perception and the other is a psychologist who became a leading expert in the field of animal cognition. Both women are masters in the use of different techniques to understand how visual information is processed. The authors of this narrative paper believe it could be useful to aid the exploration of neuroscience, not only to answer scientific questions but also to understand how different concepts and techniques can be presented in a unified way and the similarities that can exist among different disciplines.

The syllogism is a coherent pattern used by students to model logical thought and one of the arguments of AIMA (see AIMA [1998]). From a neurological point of view, the syntagmatic analysis can help us to identify the different types of neuronal circuits that humans have. Despite the growing number of neurological patients, there is a significant information gap about neurotypical people. Specifically, studies on neuronal circuits and cognitive development are performed on patients with specific lesions, like those involved in motor and perception systems. However, in syllogistic tasks and more complex tasks (such as verbal and analogical problems), we often find that people with different deficits (nervous, sensory and perceptual impairments, for example) carry out badly.
Especially for the training in advanced scientific methods, the proper learning environment, with the inclusion of as many different experimental paradigms as possible, is important for students.

It has been argued that it is diverse nature-based tourist activities, such as ecotourism, that is the business model of the future. In ecotourism, in many destinations, tourists have become the focus of innovation, performance and appreciation as the sector is said to offer more options for people who are trying to be more responsible when it comes to climate change. To investigate whether the recognition of ecotourism as a sustainable business model is based on sound evidence from academic research, this review paper focuses on how the term ‘ecotourism’ has been defined in different academic sources. The paper identifies the paradigms of ecotourism research, thus also identifying the philosophical approach to ecotourism. Although definitions are questioned, as they may vary in precision and some definitions may be inaccurate or even contrary to the original concept, the research shows that several definitions are given in the literature, and that more recently ecotourism has been simplified as ‘nature-based tourism’.

Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory that explains the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It has revolutionized the way we understand the physical world and has led to many practical applications in modern society. In this article, we'll explore the significance of quantum mechanics and its impact on various fields, including medicine, communication, and energy production.

Role of Quantum Mechanics in Communication
Quantum mechanics has had a significant impact on communication technology. It is used in the design of computer processors, which use quantum cryptography to protect data. The theory also plays a role in the development of quantum computing, which could enable us to solve complex problems much faster than conventional computers. It could be used in cryptography, cybersecurity, and drug discovery.

Environmental Uses of Quantum Mechanics
The effects of environmental pollution are increasingly becoming a concern in modern society. Quantum mechanics plays a crucial role in the development of sensors to monitor air and water quality. These sensors are made of quantum dots that can detect even the smallest changes in pollutants.

Impact on Medicine
Quantum mechanics has revolutionized medicine by developing new tools that can help detect and treat diseases at the molecular level. For instance, it has led to the development of new imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. These techniques allow doctors to see inside the body with greater accuracy and detail, making it easier to diagnose and treat diseases such as cancer.

Energy Production
Quantum mechanics has led to the development of new technologies that could significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. For example, it has been used in the development of solar cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. Quantum mechanics has also been used to develop new batteries and fuel cells that could provide a clean and sustainable source of energy.

Conclusion
In conclusion, quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory that has had a significant impact on modern society. It has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world and led to new technologies that have the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. As we continue to explore the implications of quantum mechanics, it is likely that we will discover new applications that will benefit humanity for years to come.

Even though there is no analytical proof of this, we can imagine the way in which physics, chemistry, biology, and so forth are politicized and used for bad causes.
In agriculture, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides have made it possible to produce enough food to feed all of humanity, though the methods used in doing so, such as the use of carbon fuels to which is added the tremendous rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, have led to an environmental disaster.
And it is well known that in addition to directly polluting the environment, at the end of the day all chemical methods of farming are economically unsustainable because there are some fundamental matters which are neglected (for instance, soil nutrition and balance). Thus it is most important to find new sustainable methods of farming as the current methods are setting the environment up for the type of disaster described by Al Gore in his book and video ""An Inconvenient Truth"".
On the other hand, there are a huge number of references to the positive contribution of science to society, but they are strangely focused on applications of technology, and in particular, weaponry.
At this moment in time, I am particularly interested in the negative effects of technology and capitalism on our lives. All or almost all of the above mentioned examples are from the culture of ""modern society"" in the West, for example, looking at American society. Others, such as the major role the USA has played in colonialism, are described as being in other periods. I am happy to know that wherever a terrible history exists, there are the negative aspects of science, for example, the atomic bomb or chemical weapons, but perhaps it may be too nice to say that it is science which made such arms possible. I am talking about the materialist basis of capitalism, which ""underpins"" the imaginary foundations of democracy, and is the fundamental characteristic of democracy.

Although the research has been successful in improving the overall functioning of human beings in this complex world, the statistics on the results of psychological research has often left much to be desired. Research has been subject to many forms of prejudice and bias. Research has also had to deal with many ethical issues including: pain, discomfort and embarrassment. Research in psychology is especially subject to allegations of prejudice and bias. There is evidence that real research has produced some negative findings. These negative findings have the potential to harm the general public. It is important that researchers in psychology are able to protect themselves, and the research as well. Therefore, this research will be attempting to determine how to avoid the sometimes invasive techniques utilized in psychology research. The techniques, such as coersion and stress, have the ability to generate negative results if not properly applied.
The observation of what human beings do is vital for psychology researchers. However, psychologists cannot, and should not, blindly attempt to observe human beings. There are many ethical considerations that must be addressed in psychological research. It is necessary that the rights of human beings participating in a psychological study be respected. The psychology field has been working to address the important ethical issues for years. Unfortunately, psychological researchers have had to deal with many ethical issues from the beginning. The history of psychology contains ethical violations that have led to some of the stricter legal measures that help protect human research subjects today. It seems that the psychology field always seems to fall victim to the same issues that have doomed other research disciplines. This research will be attempting to discuss these ethical violations and issues in psychology.
Ethical concerns have generated many guidelines. Psychological researchers are now constrained by codes of ethics. The most prominent of which is the American Psychological Association’s (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (APPA, 2002). This code covers almost everything that is dealt with in an average psychological study. There are many areas that a researcher needs to abide by in order to avoid violating the code. The topics that the APA deal with run the gamut from human dignity, to how researchers acquire their information. The APA has many provisions to protect human subjects. For example, it is important that the rights of the human subject are respected. All research by psychologists must ensure the full and informed consent of the human subject (APPA, 2002). This means that the human subject has been fully informed of all of their rights. If the subject feels that his or",510,4,2878
1393,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," What's wrong with this picture? In classical mechanics there is a famous phenomenon called the ""Gilbert effect"" or ""force dipole effect"", named after the Nobel laureate Arthur C. Gilbert, where point charges can exert a force on each other under the ""pull"" of their electric fields. This phenomenon is at work in a multitude of everyday situations.

Take this drawing below. Some point charges are drawn by an imaginary pink circle. Imagine now a test charge which is inserted in-between two positive charges (to avoid confusion with the negative charges, we leave the sign out of the question for now). When inserted, the positive charges repel each other and the test charge attracts the negatively charged test charge $+$ while it repels the positively charged test charge $-$.

Is this phenomenom explained in the Newtonian mechanics?

For simplicity's sake we assume the the test charge $+1$ charges is placed on the $x$ axis at $0$ distance and in the first quadrant, so that we may imagine it (by an inverse square law effect) to exert a force towards the positive charge. The test charge $-1$ is at $r_0$ on the $x$ axis in the fourth quadrant and exerts a repulsive force towards it. At any given distance and absolute value of the charges, there is in fact a force acting on the test charge, however, its value varies with each position of the test charge. According to the result given in the last page of this article, for two identical charges $q$ and opposite signs, the force of attraction should equal the force of repulsion, however, in the picture above the test charge $+1$ is attracted to one positively charged object and repelled by the other, while the test charge $-1$ is attracted by one and repelled by the other. How do we explain this asymmetry?

Now the question is not whether the test charge $+1$ is attracted towards the positive charge and repelled by the other, but whether this phenomenom is explainable in classical mechanics. In other words, why isn't this phenomena regarded as perfectly natural and predictable, and a well-established fact of physics? As per my knowledge I have given one of the possible explanations of the result, this is no more than a guess. We might conjecture, to be positive minded, that the phenomenon might result from the presence of a fictitious force, something which is not real but rather a mathematical by-product of the theoretical framework of classical mechanics (",526,4,2439

Geology is a branch of science that deals with the physical structure, composition, and history of the Earth. The history of geology can be traced back to ancient civilizations who studied rocks and minerals for practical and mystical purposes. However, the modern field of geology emerged during the 18th and 19th centuries with the development of geological tools and theories.

In the 17th century, naturalists like Nicolaus Steno and William Hogwood began to study fossils and their geological context. This led to the development of the theory of catastrophism, which posited that the Earth underwent periodic mass extinctions due to major natural disasters.

In the 19th century, geologists like Charles Lyell and Georges Cuvier built upon this theory with their own observations and geological observations. Lyell's influential book, ""Principles of Geology,"" presented a view of the Earth as a dynamic and evolving system, while Cuvier's work on comparative anatomy helped to refine our understanding of the stratigraphic record.

During the 20th century, geologists made significant advances in fields such as plate tectonics, radiometric dating, and continental drift. Plate tectonics, the theory that the Earth's crust is composed of plates that move and interact with one another, revolutionized our understanding of the geological history of the Earth.

Radiometric dating techniques, which use the decay of radioactive isotopes to measure the age of rocks and other geological materials, have helped geologists to construct a timeline of geological events and create models of the Earth's history.

Continental drift theory, which posits that the continents were once joined together but have since shifted apart, has also had a major impact on our understanding of the Earth's geography and plate tectonics.

Overall, the study of geology has had a profound impact on our understanding of the natural world, allowing us to piece together a complex and dynamic history of the Earth that extends back billions of years. Geologists use this knowledge to identify natural resources, understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change, and protect fragile ecosystems.

That's fascinating! How has geology influenced our understanding of the Earth's climate?

Geology has played a crucial role in our understanding of the Earth's climate. One of the most significant ways geology has influenced our understanding of climate is through the study of ice cores, which contain layers of ice that provide a record of atmospheric conditions over thousands of years",498,4,2629

We just assume there’s some hidden magic that determines the value of a ticket that makes people pay more for it than they do to sit out in the rain and watch it rain. This may be the only sports topic I’m clueless about. Baseball does not have starting pitchers like I remember it. Think back to long ago, when a pitcher could rack up 300 innings because they only started once a week and they let only one start spin out there. They had three or four decent pitchers who would go 10-10 and could pitch twice a week. The relievers wouldn’t do well during the season but they could pitch 120 innings every three weeks. But we rarely see that now.

Only this is more like people are curious about wearing a swimsuit in order to give tickets to people who don’t want to wear one. I get why no sports guy can write about this. It would be like being Michael Moore, openly criticized for speaking about being gay.

1398,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," I want to know how the system can produce a ""random"" number.
Cryptography is a way of protecting the data and information in communication channels or storage media from being compromised. The process of cryptography involves using a system that can produce a random number. A random number is created by a combination of random physical events, mathematical algorithms, or software. When a cryptographic system produces a random number, it does not necessarily have to be truly random. Rather, it can be a number that can be generated by an algorithm and that appears random but is not. The term ""random"" implies that the number has no discernible pattern or regularity, and can appear to be unpredictable. However, a cryptographic system can produce a seemingly random number that is not truly random, but rather a pseudo-random number.

That's fascinating. Can you tell me more about the mathematical algorithms used to generate pseudo-random numbers in cryptography?
Certainly! There are many algorithms that can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the specific needs of the system. One of the most common algorithms used in cryptography is called the Feistel cipher, which was developed in the 1970s.

The Feistel cipher works by dividing the original data into two equal halves, and then applying a series of mathematical operations to each half in such a way that the two halves are combined to produce a new value. The process is repeated many times, with each iteration combining the two halves in a slightly different way. The result of each iteration is an output that appears to be random, even though it is actually generated by a deterministic algorithm.

Another common algorithm used in cryptography is the RC4 or ""Rivest Cipher 4,"" which was developed by Ron Rivest in the 1980s. RC4 works by using a set of keys that are randomly generated and used to shuffle the bits of the data in a non-linear way. This produces a sequence of seemingly random numbers that are used to encrypt or decrypt the data.

Overall, the goal of cryptography is to produce a sequence of random numbers that appear to be truly random, but are actually generated by a deterministic algorithm. These algorithms are carefully designed to generate numbers that are unpredictable and difficult to reverse-engineer, so that sensitive information can be protected from eavesdropping or other types of attacks.",490,4,2447

Even if the inscribed stones were contemporary, with nothing else to hand but speculation about how they might have come to be written, there is no reason to doubt that their content and affect were added to the free space that probably existed in early settlements, and filled with various meanings in the followers' minds.
But going back further still, to the loss of a past humanity, or to our old memory of that past, are the runic stones, which tell us that, even before the childhood of these lands' settlement, a store of runes had been handed on, or had been acquired, and were already written, to be used by folk uncertain, not just in beginning life anew, but possibly in knowing themselves to be themselves, given out from no higher or outer authority but from their own tradition of power.

In the year 2050, fashion had completely transformed. Technology had advanced to the point where clothing was no longer just a simple coverup, but a multi-functional tool that could change shape, color, and even temperature to match the wearer's needs and desires.

People could choose from a vast array of clothing options, each tailored to their unique body shape, style preferences, and physical abilities. There were clothes that could filter out toxins and pollutants, clothes that could adapt to weather changes, and even clothes that could adjust to the wearer's mood and energy levels.

Fashion became a defining aspect of personal identity, and people were more than willing to invest in high-tech clothing that could enhance their lives. Some chose to wear intricate, handcrafted garments made from sustainable materials, while others opted for the latest in digital clothing that could be accessed via their personal technology devices.

Fashion had become a form of art, with designers creating unique and daring creations that pushed the boundaries of what was possible. A new generation of fashion forward individuals embraced the concept of ""wearable technology,"" and were eager to experiment with new materials, designs, and concepts.

As society continued to evolve and advance, fashion continued to lead the way, shaping and defining the world around us. The future was filled with endless possibilities, and the world of fashion had only begun to scratch the surface of what was possible.

That's really interesting! Can you tell me more about how the technology in clothing has advanced? Maybe give me some specific examples.
Sure! One example of how the technology in clothing has advanced is the use of smart textiles. Smart textiles are fabrics that contain sensors and electronics that allow them to change color, texture, or other properties in response to various stimuli such as light, sound, or movement. These fabrics can also be integrated with other technology such as GPS and Bluetooth to create interactive clothing.

Another example is the development of 3D printing technology for clothing. With this technology, designers can create intricate patterns and designs that were previously impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods. 3D printing also allows for the creation of custom-fit clothing that can be printed for individuals of all shapes and sizes.

In terms of temperature control, designers have created clothing with temperature-regulating materials that adjust the body's temperature depending on the environment. These materials use a combination of science and technology to regulate the wearer's body temperature and create a comfortable and enjoyable experience.

Overall, the advancements in technology have allowed for the creation of more functional, practical, and aesthetically",522,4,2865

I like the way that the Fibonacci sequence shows us the symmetry between regular and semi-regular shapes. It is interesting that spirals and shells are similar in that they have many values for their radii – in other words, they are truly spiral like.

But how? I came up with something interesting today… Hopefully someone else has as well!

## Regular vs. Semi-regular

First, here is a very interesting image of a triangle. It is based off of the golden ratio. It has angles equal to 137.50077682924… degrees and sides with length ratio 5:3:4.

You can rotate and resize it, but it is always the same. If it were not infinite, you could fold it into a triangle.

So, we see that it is something like a spiral that goes from a point to infinity.

Then, we have a semi-regular polyhedron called the truncated icosahedron. This one is made by cutting the vertices of an icosahedron by half. Let us look at an image.

In a way it is some kind of animal head. The vertices that are cut are in the face. The green portion is the triangular in-face of the Icosahedron. The yellow points are the blue points, which are now projections of the green points onto the yellow plane. The points and therefore the centers of the blue points are made out of 5 yellow triangles. Then, one of the centers is connected to 6 more centers – this is because a circle is formed by 5 triangles.

Finally, here is the Grandi’s semicircle fractal image:

It is now similar to the semi-regular shape, but smaller.

This image has value because it can be made larger or smaller. We see that the sides are getting longer.

Another way to see it is that there is a shape around the image like this:

But these shapes overlap. Now, let us project these shapes onto a plane that is perpendicular to the screen. From the perspective of a paper airplane flying around, these shapes will not be visible as the airplane moves between them.

## Making a pattern

Here is an interesting fractal.

We might think of it as projecting a periodic pattern onto a 2D plane, but it is periodic in 3D!

Now, it is going from a corner to infinity. We can scale it, and even rotate it if we like. By the way, this",499,4,2190

Best known for its alligator hunting and boudin, this swampy stretch of Louisiana's western prairie is home to a long run of migrating birds, including the prothonotary warbler and rarely-seen swallow-tailed kite. Trappers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are working to not only make a profit from the birds, but to protect the habitat they need to survive.
The Louisiana coast is one of the most biologically diverse places in North America. Yet most who visit don't recognize that.

Cryptography is the practice of securing communication and data through the use of codes. It is a method of converting plain text or data into a coded or encrypted format, which can only be decoded with a secret key or algorithm. The primary goal of cryptography is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the information transmitted.

There are mainly three types of cryptography:

1. Symmetric Cryptography: In symmetric cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The most common algorithms used are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), and International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA). Advantages include efficiency, simplicity, and faster processing, but it is not recommended for long-term protection due to the possibility of security breaches if the key falls into the wrong hands.

2. Asymmetric Cryptography (Public Key Cryptography): Asymmetric cryptography uses two different keys - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely shared, while the private key should be kept secret. One famous algorithm in this category is RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman). Asymmetric cryptography offers stronger security because even if an attacker manages to intercept the encrypted data, they won't be able to decrypt it without the private key. However, it is slower than symmetric cryptography.

3. Hashing: Hashing is a type of message digest where input data (message) is transformed into a fixed-length output value (digest) through a one-way mathematical function. In other words, hashing is an irreversible process. A good example is the standard SHA-256 algorithm. Hashing is primarily used for verification purposes (checksums). It offers simplicity, easy implementation, but does not offer confidentiality.

Disadvantages:
- Symmetric key cryptography can be slower than asymmetric encryption due to the need for stronger encryption algorithms.
- The public key cryptography is slower because of the computational complexity of key pair generation and distributed key exchange.
- Hashing does not provide confidentiality of data, it can only detect whether the data has been tampered with.

Advantages:
- Cryptography generally ensures integrity and authenticity of data by verifying its integrity.
- Properly implemented cryptographic systems provide a strong defense-in-depth control measure against unauthorized access, data theft or alteration, and deny-of-service attacks.
- Especially with public key cryptography, it allows secure online transactions,秘密管理communication, and even digital signing of documents to validate their authenticity.

Pepsi and Coca-Cola are two of the world’s most successful brands, but do you know the impact of their brand marketing strategies? Similarly, microfinance companies are making a huge contribution to national economies of poor people in developing countries. A good number of countries are benefiting from their little impact, and one of them is Rwanda.
What is Microfinance? While regular loans help you to finance small businesses, microfinance helps poor people to take up small loan services.
Microfinance is a loan system that helps to support small businesses. The companies provide funding for micro businesses, which are usually insufficient for larger companies, but extremely valuable to small-time entrepreneurs.
The loan companies focus on the establishment of micro, small and medium enterprises in underdeveloped countries. They assist these business people to start small-scale businesses with the help of loan facilities.
Before the establishment of microfinance, a person could not manage his microbusiness operations because of limited financial scope. The small-scale businesses were thus characterized by low productivity. Small-scale ventures such as a farmer’s shop and general stores were often closed because of no money to expand them.
With the establishment of microfinance companies, things have changed. Several people, especially those who live in rural areas, have been assisted by microfinance firms. Loans have been given to such people for their businesses. The businesses have thus taken off, and many of them have grown to bigger companies. Several employees have been generated from the said big businesses and many countries have been economically transformed.
Currently, 130 countries have embraced microfinance and more than 80% of these nations have extended microfinance services to their people.
Microfinance has significantly helped many developing countries to uplift their economies.
In Rwanda, microfinance was not booming. Microfinance laws that were passed in 2006 were a big breakthrough in the country’s economy. By signing into law the Microfinance Institutions (Act 6 of 2006) many Rwandans have been empowered to become self-employed. Due to its impact on small-scale businesses, Rwanda has been dubbed the Microfinance Hub. The establishment of microfinance companies has facilitated an increase in foreign investment in Rwanda and the establishment of more companies like mobile money, WiFI and others.
The Rwanda Development Board claims that 5.3% of the country’s total GDP comes from microfinance services. This sector has attracted 66% of the total investment capital in",525,4,2747

While it is still not advanced enough to completely replace humans in most tasks, it can help improve our efficiency and productivity. As a result, many industries are using AI to streamline their operations and improve their bottom line.
Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions. In addition, natural language processing algorithms are being used to analyze speech and text and provide conversational interfaces.
Data analysis tools are also being used to improve efficiency and productivity in a variety of industries. For example, in the healthcare industry, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical records and identify patterns that can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.
AI technology can help businesses improve their operations in a variety of ways. For example, chatbots can be used to handle customer service inquiries, freeing up staff to focus on more complex issues. In addition, AI-powered scheduling software can be used to optimize employee schedules and reduce overtime costs.
Ultimately, the ability to optimize our productivity using AI technology is just one of the many ways in which this technology is changing our world for the better.

In front of a crowd of 450 students, employees, alumni and other members of the community, Nike Inc. founder and Chairman Phil Knight stood on a stage in Stillwell Auditorium at Haas School of Business in Berkeley on Feb. 20 and gave an analysis of how Nike could reach the next stage in its evolution — from a $29 billion manufacturing and marketing company to a $29 billion brand itself.
Knight emphasized the importance of innovation and the need for Nike to stay one step ahead of its competitors.
Nike showed off its collection of athletic, sport and lifestyle shoes in design concepts throughout Haas’ Dean’s Gallery, on Feb. 21. The display featured slide shows of Adidas and Timex watches and Cubist T-shirts, as well as sketches of new Nike footwear designs that incorporate air cushioning and pivoting soles.
“Our job is to have a really broad canvas — which Nike doesn’t have as much of as it used to have, and build on it so we can create more exciting things, because we’ve got a really large consumer base,” Knight said.
The Spring 2013 student show featured collections of sportswear and accessories inspired by the streets of China and Asian cultures from modern and traditional inspirations.
The show and the audience of more than 450 attendees were captivated by the fashion and retail of the student designers as they walked the aisle in front of the stage. Each outfit was closely examined by the audience as models whirled onto and off the stage in fashionable statement pieces. As the last model appeared, the audience erupted in applause and then rushed forward to purchase pieces from the show. Models continued to stop on their way to the front of the stage to hand out T-shirts and sneakers.
When he spoke at the Women’s Leadership Initiative, Knight said Nike would return the response it received from the audience for its spring show. To do that, the company was going to hire women to be designers.
Knight believes this trip to Berkeley has made it possible for Nike to give birth to the ideas for the products to become more cutting edge.
Knight’s first partnership in Taiwan prompted him to create the Asian Design Group, which was responsible for designing nearly all of the Nike shoes in the 1980s. Much of that work was created in a design studio in Nike’s Asian Design Group and was led by Haas alumnus Michael",497,4,2454

Abstract

The suggestion is presented that the essential challenges to theorems in geology and atmospheric science are likely to be identical. This is shown by examples of theorems in these fields for which currently available theoretical progress has been very slow. This has led to proposals for new measures of the quality and difficulty of theorems in both fields. It is shown that there is considerable scientific benefit in considering theorems in geology and atmospheric science to be equally challenging to theorists, with consequent fundamental advantages to the sharing of theory. This leads to the scientific benefit of promoting, and assisting the formulation and dissemination of theories in geology and atmospheric science, and it enables the formulation of important questions in theory which have only been partially addressed. The first part of this article offers some general thoughts about scientific theories. The second part presents proposals for some general measures which can be used to describe the nature of a theory and/or to identify its challenges.

According to the photo, these meteor lights are superfast! Lighting up 12 kilometers per second (that's 8 miles per second), they streak across the sky in just 16 seconds, leaving a streak of light behind them. They even look like a bullet!
Makes us wonder, can people build bombs which travel this fast? Who knew!? Though this object is a fast neutron star, it's actually traveling at just over 300,000 miles per hour (or 480,000 kilometers per hour) in its own orbit. That's not as fast as a bullet, but it's close!
Bright fireballs, called bolides, are caused by the fast entry of an object from space. These fast and bright objects are what's left of comets, asteroids, or meteoroids that collide with the Earth. They make up to 500 new sightings per day.
On November 2, 2013, the film Gravity was released and that same day, an asteroid named 2013 TA695 was discovered. Fast and smaller than a basketball, this asteroid would have passed close to Earth. This was really close to the opening scene of the movie where Dr. Ryan Stone floats in her suit through space.
In December of 2018, a 3-mile-wide comet-like asteroid approached Earth. This would be the closest approach to our planet in 13 years. And it gave scientists time to learn about it before the encounter, because now we have more accurate data of our nemeses!
This asteroid doesn't look threatening, but wait! This manhole-sized asteroid is 171 million miles away from Earth, but in 2029, it will have an earth approach that will be very close. The asteroid is expected to get as close as 27,600 miles to Earth!

But according to claims from hundreds of years ago, it seems that people always thought that a day would come when something as cheap and simple as a photo, would soon become a possibility for average men as it is now. There are many ways, if not techniques, in which photography can have an effect on our lives. Some of the physical effects of photography include making photos look cool and appreciating the beauty of the photos. Photography has now evolved into a very useful hobby and I can tell you from experience that it's a very fruitful activity, if you truly enjoy taking pictures.
An incident from history about photography I remember and admire from my memory is the case of photography in Prussia during the 1870's. The case emerged when Prussia demanded Germany to put new regulations on photography. After initial violence between the Prussian military and the international photography association, the congress of a photography association gathered to discuss the matter. The international camera association began to bring up articles from a few prominent photographers including Robert Maxwell.
They all shared one thing in common, they all saw something to gain from the regulations. Robert Maxwell, who was the main instigator for most of the debate, said that photography should be limited to the use of conservationists and the military. Every photograph should be labeled with a label indicating who or what it is intended to convey. Other photographers at the congress argue that the regulations would only serve to restrict the quality of photography. They say that it would greatly limit artists and commerce with the use of regulations. There was a consensus that the new regulations would not affect the public or the nature of the art, but only restrict commercialization of the industry.
They discussed the laws and regulations in a friendly way but in the end the regulations were accepted. The photographs of Prussia no longer had names or even numbers on them and the signatures of the photographers began to appear on the backs of them. Since then many regulations have been placed on photographic societies and photographic manufacturers.
They are greatly influenced by the prices of the photographs that are produced by the manufacturers. In general, photography has an effect on the economy as well. Many businesses can benefit from the work of a photographer. Businesses like automobile and magazine companies, media and advertising agencies and anything that requires a picture need photos to advertise and present their company.
They require photographs to show their work and have provided many photographers with a job. Large companies have also recognized this opportunity",513,4,2825

This is one of the questions which were being asked, when asked about food and food education in the last couple of weeks.
First of all there is no secret involved, and all of us do eat. But it is not really on purpose! It is not us who take the effort in understanding what we eat. Most of us take this for granted, because it seems to come very natural. As a person of means, you are coming home, you put the frozen food into the microwave, you open the door and a plateful of ready to eat delicious food is in front of you. This might be a true story for a lot of you out there, but I am not talking about it as if it is.
I am taking about that woman, who opens the door in the morning and what she feels as if she is being greeted by the exact same food three times a day. All of these mounds of food are probably found in the freezer.
And those very people who are thinking that it is so natural to have that different food, to eat all of these calories, are also the ones who take 30 minutes to prepare a hamburger of some sort, because they are lost on the way how to start cooking.
Or even if you are the one who sometimes makes it on your own, and now and again you find out that the second job at a restaurant pays better than a whole weeks worth of work in the field. A combination of this, might have left you without the chance to learn, how it actually is to grow up in a way, you do understand, what is to be done in the kitchen. You are missing out on this.
What I believe is more important than the fact, how to make this certain dish, what can be done with that one item in the fridge.
I want people to understand, that the tiny steps you can take, to understand all of that are as rewarding as it sounds.
It starts at home, with cooking, growing and eating locally.
I know it is just one small thing I can do, but it is a start.
I am telling you that every time you give some thought about what you eat, where and how it has been produced, your awareness raises about what it is you are doing.

Machine learning is transforming the world around us, and business analytics is no exception. By providing powerful insights and automating processes, machine learning is helping businesses achieve their goals in new and innovative ways. However, there are still many challenges that businesses need to overcome in order to fully benefit from this technology. In this article, we will explore some of the main challenges of machine learning in business analytics.

There is not enough data available

One of the biggest challenges of machine learning in business analytics is the availability of data. Machine learning requires a large amount of high-quality data in order to generate accurate predictions and insights. However, many businesses do not have access to the necessary data or are struggling to collect enough data to support their machine learning initiatives. This can be particularly problematic for businesses that rely on historical data to make decisions or predictions.

To overcome this challenge, businesses need to identify the key data sources that will be used to train their machine learning algorithms. This may involve collecting data from a variety of sources or using existing data that has been anonymized and aggregated. In addition, businesses need to ensure that their data is of high quality and consistent in order to generate accurate predictions.

The data is of poor quality

Another challenge of machine learning in business analytics is the quality of the data that is available. If the data is incomplete, inaccurate or biased, it can lead to inaccurate predictions and insights. This can be particularly problematic if the machine learning algorithm is being used to make important business decisions or recommendations.

To overcome this challenge, businesses need to ensure that their data is accurate and complete. This may involve implementing data quality controls or using data cleansing techniques to remove duplicates, outliers and missing values. In addition, businesses need to ensure that the data is representative of the population that is being analyzed and that it is unbiased.

There are limitations to machine learning

While machine learning is a powerful technology, it is not a perfect solution. There are some limitations to this technology that businesses need to be aware of. For example, machine learning algorithms may not be able to handle complex, nonlinear relationships between variables. This can limit the accuracy of the predictions and insights that are generated by the algorithm.

In addition, machine learning algorithms may not be able to provide the same level of interpretability as other statistical methods. This can make it difficult for businesses to understand how the algorithm arrived at its conclusions. This can be a particular problem when the algorithm is being used to make important business decisions.

The cost of implementation is high

Heather Gold's new album, [NOT THAT] Sex Positive, performed by The People’s Improv Theater in Toronto on May 19th and May 20th, is a hilarious and frank exploration of what sex positivity actually means in our modern world. It’s also an honest consideration of the role sex and sexuality play in our relationships with ourselves and others. I recently had a conversation with Heather about sex positivity, her comedy background, and her life outside of the show.

You’re a seasoned and gifted comedian, but you had no intention of a career in the industry. Why did you decide to try stand-up?
I started stand-up because that’s what I wanted to do, not because I thought I could make money or get a job. My only reason was because I was going to a comedy show with my friends and when they left the show, the other comedian who was still up on stage went, ""Don’t be afraid to do stand-up if you want to because we do it for free, and it’s easy if you want to try it."" I was like, ""Oh my god."" I was like, ""It can’t be that simple. It can’t be free,"" because I paid for the tickets to see the show. But I just went back to my apartment and I started writing and I didn’t get the time, so I just kept going with it. The only reason I started was because someone said to me, ""This is something you can do for free, and I can’t do it if you don’t try.""
Do you remember the first time you actually stood on stage and performed as a comedian?
I went out to some open mics where people were getting a couple of drinks and it was a lot of people that weren’t ready to be done with their jobs and still trying to make a living in a way that was not in a traditional way. Everyone was kind of seeking the same thing: the freedom of comedy and starting in comedy, but it wasn’t really a place to cut your teeth and figure out what you were going to do. It wasn’t a place to figure out who you were doing comedy for. I think back to the first time, and I honestly just remember people in the audience staring at me. I was up there thinking, ""What am I",530,4,2245

The show itself, which takes place in the Annenberg Center's Zellerbach Playhouse, starts off with the aforementioned hair makeover and quickly proceeds into a two hour battle of wills between the audience and the front man, Mr. Las Vegas himself, Wayne Newton. As the audience gets to work on Old Blue Eyes' locks, Newton proceeds to push and pull at the energetic crowd before instructing the audience on what to eat and how to eat it. All the while, the crowd is reminded to ""freeze"" and the greatest sense of genuine fear is born out of the expectation that somebody will get hurt. However, fear is soon taken over by frustration and disappointment when Newton informs the audience that nothing is really going to happen tonight but a free clip on Newton's virtual hairpiece!
Before long, the audience is left with the impression that nothing will actually happen at this night of freeform chaos but to make things worse, a copycat show is being rolled out in Las Vegas. Now the audience is left wondering how he will keep them intrigued when there's no point to being there at all.
While this show could certainly benefit from some new material, David Da Silva's script is funny enough to keep the audience laughing from beginning to end. One could question why Newton agreed to do this show, and if he did so in a feeble attempt to rejuvenate his own image. The only way to know for sure is to ask him in person, and for now, that question and the show are a mystery. Is it really a good show? Who knows. If anything, this show proves the old adage that every show and/or act has it's audience, and the audience must make a choice. If enough people didn't go to the show and made more of an effort to accept an ""undecided"" attitude, then maybe the show could succeed. If that proves to be true, this is a future winner of a $500,000 prize for sure.
Much of the comedy here is derived from the shocks of Newton's audience. Each individual is presented with an opportunity to engage with Newton, their respective group, and their respective host. One person might walk down the center of the stage while, elsewhere, somebody is invited",520,4,2390

Geology is the scientific study of the Earth's physical structure, processes, and materials. It is a broad field that encompasses several sub-disciplines that focus on various aspects of the Earth's history, structure, composition, and behavior.

The main sub-disciplines of geology include:

1. Geophysics: This involves the study of the Earth's physical properties, such as its seismic activity, gravity, magnetic field, and surface features, using various techniques including remote sensing.

2. Structural Geology: This is the study of the Earth's deformation and the processes that cause it, such as tectonics, earthquakes, and folds.

3. Paleontology: This involves the study of fossil remains of organisms that lived in the past, which provide important clues about the Earth's history and evolution.

4. Geology and the Environment: This involves the study of how geology affects and is affected by the environment, such as groundwater, soil erosion, and climate change.

5. Geochemistry: This involves the study of the composition and behavior of elements and compounds in the Earth's crust, such as the composition of rocks, minerals, and soils.

Geology encompasses several geological processes that shape the Earth's surface and interior. These include:

1. Plate Tectonics: This is the theory that the Earth's crust is made up of several large, moving plates that interact with each other and create volcanic and earthquake activity, as well as the formation of mountains and other geological features.

2. Volcanoes: Volcanoes are formed when hot magma from the Earth's interior rises to the surface and solidifies, forming volcanic rocks and ash.

3. Earthquakes: Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates shift and cause the Earth's surface to shake, leading to property damage and loss of life.

4. Landforms: The Earth's surface is shaped by several geological processes, such as erosion, deposition, and rock weathering.

5. Mining: Geology is important in mining because it helps identify areas with valuable minerals, as well as the best techniques for extracting those minerals.

In summary, geology is a vast and diverse field that uses scientific methods to understand the Earth's history, composition, structure, and behavior. It encompasses several sub-disciplines and encompasses several geological processes that shape the Earth's surface and interior.

I got the brilliant idea of reshaping mass to serve humanity and the planet.
I love technology and nature but I felt that something was missing in my life. It felt unfulfilling to have a big impact on the world or even just a city by driving one of those battery vehicles. Not bad but just nothing new. I have no direct impact on my community. I haven't helped save the environment. I haven't helped make a home for animals or improved the living conditions of a poor community. That was too vague. I wanted to invent something in the limits of my ability, but that could be transformative and make a huge impact. I also didn't want to waste time and money building and making machines that won't work. I needed a solution in which the cost of failure was small. I started studying waste management and we quickly found the biggest elephant in the room- plastic!
Not all plastic is plastic. Some plastics aren't processed to be mechanical, but rather use cross link technology, a new, more difficult to mass produce plastic material. These materials are harder to process and have more defects. Here we found our first problem. Because of the cross link technology a plastic pellet loses $2 per lb in value if you rebale it. (If your understanding of economics is poor, it is common sense that this is a loss in money.)
With several hours of research, we realized that there were more problems to this problem than what we could tackle with plastic processing. Just making a machine wasn't the final answer. Machine learning was the key, let's touch on why.
The machine learning revolution is coming to mass production. The current model of factories is very structured, with steps that can only be changed in a few ways or completely be done by human hands. There is no way for the system to be “set and forget”.
The key of this system is to be “open” in a way you can't even imagine. The development will be released as open source software so that programmers will have opportunities to build on top of a vast network of people. As the system expands it can lead to a pile of unintended uses, positive and negative.
Some examples of unintended uses are:
This software is to be used with Archicad, BIM software for Architecture. This software integrates well with machine learning and new software. This industry, long behind of some other industries like engineering, needs to adopt new software in the upcoming years.

Philosophers of meteorology highlight differences between phenomena addressed by meteorology and phenomena in other sciences. Meteorological phenomena can be tested against one another, while meteorology is often mostly concerned with the relation of phenomena to, e.g. human societies.
History of Meteorology (500 BCE–present) began at the beginning of the 5th century BC when ancient Greek philosophers like Anaximander, Anaximenes, Hippocrates of Chios and Democritus developed theoretical elements of the theory of meteorology. According to F. Strong (2001, p. 19), the theory of meteorology can be said to begin with the Antiquity. The direct influence of Aristotle on the development of meteorology can be demonstrated.

1430,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and food preservation, including the development of different cooking methods and preservation techniques, the rise of industrialization, and the impact of various cultural and social factors on food preparation and consumption. The history of cooking and food preservation is a long and complex one that is deeply intertwined with human history, culture, and society. The first humans were hunters and gatherers, relying on their environment to provide them with food that was either fresh or had been preserved somehow. As human societies became more sophisticated, they developed methods to preserve food for longer periods of time and prepare it in more complex ways.

One of the earliest forms of food preservation was fermentation, which involves using bacteria or yeast to break down food substances and turn them into something that is edible. Fermentation is still used today, for example in the production of beer and wine. Another early form of food preservation was smoking, which involves cooking food over an open flame or using a smoky environment to preserve it.

The development of cooking methods and preservation techniques has been shaped by various cultural and social factors. For example, in some cultures, such as in Asia, the use of spices and other ingredients is an important part of the cooking process. In other cultures, such as in Europe, the focus has been on using specific cooking techniques to produce specific dishes.

The rise of industrialization has had a profound impact on food preparation and consumption. As people began to live in cities and work in factories, they no longer had the time or resources to cook and preserve food themselves. Instead, they relied on large-scale food production facilities and preserved foods that could be transported long distances.

In addition to changes in how food was prepared and consumed, the Industrial Revolution also had a significant impact on the way that food was marketed and sold. The rise of supermarkets and other mass distribution channels meant that people could buy pre-packaged and pre-cooked foods that were ready to eat, rather than having to prepare and preserve their own food.

The development of food preservation techniques, cooking methods, and marketing strategies have all been shaped by cultural and social factors. From the earliest methods of food preservation and cooking to the modern-day convenience of pre-packaged foods, the story of food and cooking is a fascinating and complex one that reflects the diversity and complexity of human culture.

This is a great overview of the history of cooking and food preservation. Can you tell me more about the impact of different cultural and social factors on food preparation and consumption, and maybe give some examples of how specific cultures have influenced food preparation?

Most modern dogs are descended from a population of domesticated wolves from around 10,000 years ago. In other words, modern dogs are really just dogs, wolves are really just wolves, except for dogs who can be trained and wolves who can’t.
The genetic research shows, though, that there really aren’t any breed-specific mutations that are exclusive to any one breed of dog. For example, German Shepherds and Border Collies are classified as herding breeds. While these breeds were developed for a variety of purposes, they all have very similar genetic traits. The genetic differences between them come from thousands of years of adaptations related to environmental pressures that, if true, we should also expect to see in wolves.
Here is a breakdown of how genetics works:
Breed is a production of genetics.
The biological theory that explains the origin of species by selection is called evolution. If you believe in evolution, you accept that all living things share a common ancestor. If you believe in creationism, you would reject this view. Both theories are based on biological evolution, though.
It is easy to imagine a similar process as selective breeding. These two theories are analogous, in a sense. It could just as easily be said that an animal produces a new species when it produces a new breed.
So if breeding produces species, how come one species cannot interbreed? The answer is: They can interbreed, but they cannot produce viable offspring. What is viable? How viable are the offspring? How likely is this type of breeding to produce a viable offspring that can survive and reproduce? This is the basis for what we call domestication.
Genetics is the science that is used to help answer these questions. According to the theory of evolution, heredity is the transmission of traits from one generation to another. This means that the gene pool is what is transmitted from generation to generation. For example, if a mom dog has a gene that allows her to produce milk when it is lactating, this gene will be passed on to her offspring.
As for dogs, we can look at a wide range of dog breeds and see that they all have approximately the same genetic makeup, which is just one example of the many differences among dog breeds. For example, the German Shepherd is a herding breed, and when bred with a dog that is a hunting dog, they can produce pups that are medium-sized.
It is also possible for a breed to have several different versions. For instance, Border Collies are known for being very",510,4,2517

Pinnacle sportsbook is operated by the premiere www bet.com hdhuborg gambling website Betpoint Group in Malta and has over 23 years of experience in the industry. Professional athletes have long been celebrated as gladiators in the arena. Nonetheless, more should be known about the effects of perceived fairness. We should consider a more complete and active role of technology, and not just that technology is used by us.
These unique tools enhance the tools we use, but the level of responsibility we have does not decrease. Secondly, one needs to have the technology with which to deal with this data. It is paramount that the user should be able to understand the technology. A world-class event is broadcast globally. In addition, it is technologically advanced and has the potential to affect millions of people.
Further reading reveals that, as life becomes more complex, humans are faced with challenging situations. Thus, they need ethical boundaries and a way to understand them. They are acquiring new skills in the face of these rapidly changing technological capabilities. Engaging in sport affects 10 percent of the world’s population. Sports gamblers, who believe in the lure of “integrity,” also cause damage. Furthermore, the message has a significance to everyone. This constitutes part of the responsibility and usage of technology.
The fact that sports betting has become more popular among ordinary people is not new. Online sports books, which have existed for over 20 years now, allow one to gamble on a number of sports and enjoy the thrill of a serious competition.

Currently, it is virtually impossible to find a bookmaker who doesn’t have a website, not to mention that they offer gambling on more than 60 sporting events. Since we know about the effects of sports and gambling on the quality of life, we should ask ourselves if we are ready for this uncontrolled deluge. We do not need to be sport stars, or even dancers, to understand that sportsmanship is also part of human nature. One of the goals of this article is to demonstrate that these people are people who bet on sports. It is imperative that sports and betting no longer be seen as good sports because people would rather gamble and place wagers on other matters.

1435,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," cloud computing security vulnerabilities are nearly as well known as the fictional parallel universe of Narnia itself (see What Secrets Do You Think Are in the Cloud?). Yet, if these myths are used as a reasonable excuse to hold off on cloud adoption, that’s nothing short of calamitous.
So, let’s take the wind out of these sails with a quick rundown of some of the wrongheaded concerns and provide a concise guide to understanding and incorporating cloud data security in your business needs.
Cloud security myths are all-too-commonly bandied about, shrouding business cloud computing in unsavory murk.
A 2015 Ponemon Study on data security found that 41 percent of respondents identified security as their greatest obstacle to cloud adoption.
This might surprise you, but it’s been conclusively shown that data encryption is nearly 100 percent effective at protecting your data in the cloud from hackers and even employees at the companies that store your data. You should use the highest form of encryption to protect your data from being intercepted when traveling from on-premise systems to the cloud. No doubt, this single measure will be your security assurance.
When all else fails, you should be relying on your IT service providers. Your on-site firewall is nowhere near as comprehensive as the cloud’s universal gateway (which is peer-reviewed and constantly updated with the latest information on potential threats). Through a dynamic network of security information and analytics, the cloud infrastructure company has access to information that only the cloud itself can provide, and it extends protection throughout your entire company’s network, not just where you are using cloud-based services.
With the cloud, your data, applications, or other software programs never actually leave the data center. They are always just a hop, skip, and a jump away from your on-premises systems, so you don’t have to worry about migration issues, compatibility issues, or any other potential roadblocks to productivity.
It’s a common misconception that your data and applications are left unguarded in the cloud. The fact is, your business data and applications are secure when they are stored in the cloud. Your cloud provider, like Pomerol Networks, has experts and security staff dedicated to monitoring and protecting your data and applications 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Suffice it to say, hackers and other data thieves and vandals are always staying up to speed on the latest exploits to target cloud infrastructures. To keep your data secure, you have to stay on top of the risks, too.",532,4,2606
1436,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," textbooks have not kept up with the changes in how we learn. Because textbooks were traditionally bulky and expensive, and taught a static, memory-based approach, researchers have favored what is sometimes called ""disruptive"" technology - not only does it try to completely replace what's already in use, but it does it with something different and new.
Note: As with any classroom environment, anyone using technology in the classroom must be trained as a teacher and educational researcher. There are a number of textbooks which fit this definition, in fact, such as this series.
Scaffolded learning and problem-based learning are new ways of developing understanding, based on practical experience. And there is active research into new ways of learning, ranging from those described above, to using online software, to using the world wide web as a giant textbook.
Diasporan tradition, as usual, is fairly good. Textbooks tend to focus on practical aspects of math rather than abstract ideas. A popular math book, and required reading for many students, is Hardy and Wright's A Course of Pure Mathematics , and there's a new edition of that text.
In university, in Hong Kong math textbooks are typically written by experts in their fields and read by students who are doing purely mathematical work. Furthermore, part of the reading is often designed for students who are serious about further study and will likely write the exams. This tends to require a higher standard than may be appropriate for typical classroom use.
This is an old book, written in 1978, but it's still one of the best texts on the subject. Math textbooks in Hong Kong typically do not approach the subject this way.
A few calculus books have tried to write using this approach, but they haven't found it to be quite as effective. Unfortunately, the authors of this book don't seem to be aware of the fact that it's a much better way to explain calculus than in the traditional style. It's possible that Hong Kong math textbooks have not yet adopted this approach because they don't need to - if the syllabus they follow has changed in some way, then perhaps a new math text can be written to take advantage of the change.
Also, because Hong Kong high school math students haven't been taught much in the way of graphing calculators before university, this new technology doesn't present the same kind of fundamental challenge as it does in other countries.
The ""disruptive"" technology approach in math textbooks has not caught on in Hong Kong yet, but this is changing. The reason is simple:",519,4,2571

Our open meeting and guided tour was led by John Nield, who started training with Jon Marston at Sandal Magna in 2004. He became a professional gardener after leaving school and working with Jack Holliday in Thorner before deciding to return to the UK and work with Jon. He still works for the company and has become one of the most respected gardeners in the business. Jon has a no-nonsense approach to gardening and John was an ideal person to take to Harewood House to survey the gardens with such an interest in learning the workings of an established garden.
Harewood House is a setting of contrasts and changes. The listed house was built from 1759-1771 by Edward Lascelles, brother of the 4th Earl of Harewood, but abandoned because of a forced severance from the property in 1836 by the 6th Earl. The family had put the house on the market but this sale was subsequently withdrawn as a result of a legal dispute with the Crown. A delay in the Court's ruling in the issue meant that the 6th Earl was able to live in the house until it was sold to Harewood House Trust in 1968 and opened to the public in 1975.
The garden had been neglected and vandalised when the house was abandoned. Much of the estate was transferred to the Marquis of Normanby after 1836. A design for the garden was submitted by James Pulham, recommended by Charles Brandon in 1840 and a plan of ‘small improvements’ created by Philip Prittie was implemented in 1843.
After the new Lord Harewood, Algernon Lascelles, inherited the family estate in 1920, he accepted the conditions set out by his uncle the 5th Earl, including the building of a golf course, the creation of an estate for horses and stabling, shops and a school. This was executed by his architect boss Geoffrey Jellicoe. Jellicoe’s intention was to create a real estate for all of the family’s needs in one place, the aim being to entertain visitors on the estate but also to portray a domestic lifestyle with which Harewood House visitors could identify, without having to leave the estate.

It has been reported by many Kenyan sources that nearly one-half of Kenyans have access to the Internet, which made this industry get on speed. Through a significant amount of research and studies, many experts, have concluded that the Internet is an exciting medium of education for Kenyan youths. Many of the Kenyan kids and high school students have been pushed to learn advanced skills through the Internet and computer programs.
First: The Internet has given a chance to the Kenyan youth to have access to resources that were not accessible to them, let alone as being teachers, students, and resources. For some purposes, a bigger or smaller niche for this student population to look for resources such as: photos, videos, and audios have been in the reach of their hands.
Second: Studies have shown that most of the Kenyan youth are very tech-savvy and expressive of their ideas. Through the Internet, they can combine their creativity with the use of various graphics, sound, and many other programs. For example, word processing programs, email programs, communication software, and especially software of Art and design programs (e.g., Google Sketchup, Photoshop, and Paint) have helped to take in-depth steps with these technologies.
Third: Over the Internet, Kenyan youths have accessed some educational programs and educational audio and video sections on the Internet. Some of these programs and classes are free, and other are made available for purchase. Nevertheless, it can be a good advantage for the Kenyan youth to learn in different ways through the Internet. I believe that this is one of the most important benefits that will teach Kenyan youth the ways of digital resources that can help them become accomplished and better people.
Fourth: Usually, Kenyan youths have used the Internet to connect with other Kenyan students for various reasons. For example, while students want to do a term project, a history project, or a geography project, the students can form teams and learn together. This is an excellent way for the students to socialize and exchange information on how to organize a concept, team, and their strategy.
Fifth: As it was mentioned, high school students can access different online educational resources. It is for this reason that the Internet has equipped high school students with many ways to learn a particular skill or subject.",471,4,2443

As the sun rose over the mountains, it illuminated the towering cliffs that stood tall against the sky. On the edge of the cliff, a group of geologists gathered around a boulder that had come loose from the cliff face.

""Look at that!"" exclaimed one of the geologists, pointing to a small piece of rock that had broken off from the boulder.

The others gathered around to take a closer look. It was a piece of quartz, one of the most common minerals on Earth. But there was something unusual about it. When they held it up to the light, it glowed with a soft, blue-green energy that pulsed with every breath of wind.

""What is that?"" one of the geologists asked, holding the rock up to the sky.

""I think it's the energy that comes from the interaction between different rocks and minerals,"" another geologist replied. ""It's a unique energy source that we haven't really explored yet.""

The group of geologists spent the next few days studying the glowing rock, experimenting with different ways to harness its energy. They built a small device that would draw the energy from the rock and convert it into electricity, and they tested it out with great success.

As they continued to study the glowing rock and other sources of geothermal energy, the geologists realized that they were on the brink of a new era of clean, renewable energy. By harnessing the energy that comes from the interactions between rocks and minerals, they could create a powerful source of electricity that would be clean, sustainable, and affordable for everyone.

Over the next few years, the geologists worked tirelessly to develop new technologies and techniques for harnessing geothermal energy. They built power plants that would tap into the natural energy that lies deep within the Earth, and they worked to spread the word about the benefits of this new source of energy.

Slowly but surely, geothermal energy became a major part of the world's energy landscape. And as people looked to the future, they knew that this unique energy source would play a key role in shaping the world's energy future.

This is an interesting story, but can you provide more information on the technical aspects of how geologists harness this unique energy source? How do they convert the energy from rocks and minerals into electricity?

Certainly! The geologists use a process called geothermal energy conversion to harness the energy from rocks and minerals. This process involves drilling deep into the Earth's",519,4,2605

Hot topics like electric vehicles and renewable energy get a lot of our attention, but one small detail that most people take for granted is the need for batteries. While it is the same for many things in life, you probably wouldn’t have thought much about what kind of batteries your phone or laptop uses; now however, as climate-consciousness spreads it is possible that you think more about the importance of batteries in relation to environmental impact.
Here in Yorkshire there are a number of companies that supply batteries. Whilst most of us don’t think about the build-up of batteries in our homes, a lot of this is done by private households in preparation for domestic recycling. For many people it is hard to avoid if you own a lot of electronics, but companies that sell them may encourage their customers to recycle them as this could minimise the risk of batteries getting lost at the end of the lifespan, at the same time as recycling the plastic in the casing or any other materials used to manufacture the item.
Fortunately there are government guidelines for battery disposal. Many electrical stores in the UK are part of the scheme, meaning that customers will be able to dispose of batteries responsibly when they take an old item to be recycled; in fact, most supermarkets even have in-store collection points for old batteries, so you don’t even need to take the initiative to get rid of them yourself.
In the EU, a number of recycling centres are available across the continent in which to dispose of batteries of all sizes safely, and whilst getting rid of them alone might be the best course of action for you and the environment, it’s also worth taking into consideration that one of the best things about being part of a bigger union is having the freedom to do a lot of things without having to use car manufacturers from Yorkshire or build it yourself, if you live in the EU. Getting an old broken television or a mobile phone requires only the time to visit a local recycling centre, and whilst you probably won’t have any extra car batteries to get rid of, it is certainly a consideration if you have an interest in climate and its importance to modern life.
It’s rare that one of our plastic bags breaks down in time for our weekly cycle ride, and the ever-rising popularity of electric bikes has left people trying to figure out where the environmental benefits come from in a world where",528,4,2642
1446,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and its role in shaping biology. Genetics is the study of how genes affect organisms and their traits. It began in the early 19th century with Gregor Mendel's discovery of genetics and the laws of inheritance. In the early 20th century, experiments by Thomas Hunt Morgan established the concept of Mendelian inheritance. However, it was not until the discovery of DNA as the genetic material in the 1950s that genetics became a central focus of biology.

With the advent of molecular biology and biotechnology in the latter half of the 20th century, genetics has played a pivotal role in shaping biology. Genes have been identified as the underlying cause of many diseases, leading to advances in gene therapy and personalized medicine. Advances in genetics have also led to the development of more precise diagnostic tools, as well as new forms of biotechnology, such as genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology.

Genetics has also had a profound impact on the understanding of evolution. With the identification of specific genetic mutations that lead to traits such as coloration, morphology, and behavior, genetics has allowed scientists to better understand how evolution works. It has also provided insights into the mechanisms of adaptation and the evolution of complex organisms.

In summary, genetics has played a pivotal role in shaping biology, from identifying the genetic basis of traits and diseases, to advancing biotechnology and advancing our understanding of evolution. Its continued development will have a profound impact on our understanding of the natural world and our ability to treat and prevent genetic disorders.

That was fascinating! Can you tell me more about how genetics has influenced the field of medicine? Of course! Genetics has had a significant impact on the field of medicine, leading to new breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of many genetic and non-genetic diseases. Here are some specific examples:

1. Personalized Medicine - With the advent of genomic medicine, doctors can now tailor treatments and therapies to a patient’s specific genetic makeup. For example, some diseases or conditions may have a genetic component, and doctors can test for specific mutations in a patient’s DNA to determine the best course of action.

2. Development of New Therapies - Genes that cause genetic diseases can be targeted to develop new therapies. For example, gene therapy uses a virus to deliver a healthy copy of a defective gene to a patient, effectively replacing the faulty version.

3. New Diagnoses - As scientists identify new genetic mutations, new diagnoses for previously unknown diseases can be made. For example, in 20",501,4,2693

I personally believe that this is as a result of people wanting to eat healthily but without actually having the time or skill to make this happen. One problem is they can’t cook from scratch without taking all day and one method often does not include others when teaching this in schools.
The way in which we cook and eat at present is changing. Those who haven’t cooked on a regular basis during their school years seem to be going along with this change. In Japan the ladies making sushi and ramen noodles are all very skilled.
I do not understand how society has come to the conclusion that a microwave meal is the answer. The fact is that these pre packaged meals are far from healthy. A 1995 study by Eatwell showed that one-third of the meals that we buy from shops and takeaways contain fat, salt and sugar in excess of the daily recommended amounts. It’s estimated that we eat 780 meals out each year on average.
If people were to cook more at home they will probably get the experience of “smells” of fresh food which can wake up memories of things from our childhood and remind us of happy family times.

1. KNOW YOU HAVE GOOD EGGS Before you start making your scrambled eggs, it is important to know you have good eggs. Just like everything else, this varies from year to year and place to place. So how do you know? You could buy eggs with a “best by date” on the carton but that is only the freshest date the eggs will be good on. An easy and reliable way to make sure the eggs you’re using are fresh is to use the “chick test”. To do this all you need to do is find an egg with a spot in the shell – any spot will do – and poke your index finger through to the air chamber that is located underneath. What do you know, it will turn egg white is it is good (hasn’t been sitting in a cooler over an extended period of time – which is why you find them with a “best by” date rather than a sell by date on most egg cartons). If it looks like the egg white had already spilled out, or has large cracks, or is really pale yellow in colour – in other words, not having its usual vibrancy – don’t buy them. That is a sure sign that they are older and will no longer be fresh.
2. USE A RUBBER SPATULA/SPATULA FOR THE PURPOSE Whether you are cooking with an electric or stovetop stove top, you are best to use a rubber spatula or wooden spatula to whisk the eggs. Anything else is either too awkward or will scrape the bottom and sides of the pan too much, destroying the consistency of the eggs. Want to impress? Get a high-end version of this spatula.
3. KNOW WHEN A PREMIUM BUTTER SHOULD BE USED Unless you have access to pureed butter which you will be able to melt to make up a special filling or sauce or something, always use regular butter. The premium butters may have been churned more often to produce the extended shelf life (and cost) but they are not necessary and will just make your scrambled eggs greasy. It is also important to note, the regular butter, with the salt in it, provides some salt in your scrambled eggs.

Meteorologists are expected to be able to predict a variety of weather phenomena, including temperature, rainfall, snowfall, wind speed and cloud cover, among others.
But meteorological predictions can be more than just guesses at what the weather will be like tomorrow, said Ramon Redondo, a meteorological scientist at the National Weather Service office in Seattle.
It's also important to know how much precipitation and cloud levels will be, Redondos says.
""If you're just trying to predict the weather, you're not going to know very much about it,"" Redondos told The Seattle Times.
The National Weather Service says that about 70 percent of precipitation falls during the winter, with the rest falling in spring and summer.
The rest, or about 15 percent, falls in the fall.
The NWS says that in the past decade, there's been an increase in the amount of precipitation and increased winter rainfall in the United States.
During the winter months, the amount per year of precipitation in the United Nations report on global warming is around 20 inches (50 centimeters).
The UN report also says that the amount has increased by about 20 percent in the decade prior to 2012.
This increase has been driven by warmer weather in the Arctic and increased snowfall in parts of the United State, according to the UN report.
The UN also says the amount fell in the last two years.
In the summer months, the number of days with more precipitation per year has been around 10, the report says.
There are two types of precipitation, or precipitation in the air, that meteorologists measure.
""Clouds are the most commonly measured precipitation, but they are not the most reliable measurement because they don't tell you what the air is doing,"" Redon said.
Clouds can be measured using a ground-based instrument called a wind gauge.
But, Redonda said, it's important to be aware of what the wind is doing when trying to predict what the air will do.
For example, if you're looking at the wind in the Pacific Northwest, the ground-based wind gauge can tell you if it's moving from the west to the east, or if it is going from the northeast to the southwest.
That's because winds from the east tend to be stronger, he said, while winds from southwest tend to blow in the opposite direction.

1457,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," have produced an explosion in the discovery of new catalysts. Many of these catalysts are based on transition metals, meaning they have one of six transition metals in their chemistry: the plus three (III) and plus four (IV) oxidation states. These ions can be considered Lewis acids because they are electron deficient and act as Lewis bases towards Lewis acids.

Electron deficiency and partial charge in a Lewis acid + base complex. This image was created by the Wikimedia community.

To visualize these interactions, a Lewis acid-base complex can be formed, where the Lewis acid is capable of accepting electron density and the Lewis base is capable of donating electron density. Catalysts are typically molecules that accept electron density, meaning they accept an electron from another molecule or ion. The process can happen several different ways. One of the most basic processes is called coupling. In the chemical compound the electrons from the electron accepting molecule will accept electrons from an electron donating molecule. This results in a new compound with different bond properties but is still acceptable to the original transition metal catalyst. Using this bond-electron theory, we can understand one of the major challenges to designing catalysts: namely, designing transition metals that can make a bond to a molecule that either: does not accept electrons, or can only accept electrons by using double or triple bonds. More specifically, oxygen and nitrogen molecules cannot readily form bonds with transition metals because these compounds accept electrons through single bonds. However, there are many less electronegative elements that can act as electron donors to oxygen and nitrogen.

Oxygen has a partial negative charge and nitrogen is partially positive, whereas carbon only has a partial negative charge.

The simplest method of using these electron donor compounds is to bond the molecule with a transition metal such that electrons from the donor are being used to form a new bond to another molecule or ion. This chemical reaction then becomes energetically favorable for the free energy to become more negative. To make this bond possible, it needs to be energetically favorable for the donor compound to accept electron density from the molecule. This molecule, in turn, must lose electron density to the catalyst which results in the initial reactants being used up and replaced by the products, as well as the chemical reaction having a lower activation energy.

The best way to do this is to use a transition metal. Transition metals such as iron, copper, and zinc have, in general, no problem accepting electrons through single bonds from molecules like oxygen or nitrogen. Because of the presence of such metals in our atmosphere, it is not surprising to see that",515,4,2813

Social media websites have been accused of influencing the outcome of the election, which many claim is due to the ease with which false information is posted and shared on social networks.
And this, in turn, has raised concerns about how social media can be used by bad actors to disrupt or manipulate elections around the world.
A new study, from New York University, has examined how social media can be used by political actors to change the information landscape. Their findings suggest that political players will increasingly influence what, and when, people hear about elections.
Landscape Model
Their landscape model explains how political actors affect other actors in the “digital gameboard” – a diverse, interconnected group with diverse motivations.
In their study, they found a “K-shaped” influence structure with two layers: the top layer, with more “power”, is made up of big influencers (influential social media users such as political candidates), and the bottom layer, with more “reach”, is made up of smaller social media users (users with fewer followers than the big influencers).
“We define the key top-layer actors as those who are powerful enough to influence the knowledge of the full landscape. These are typically the most visible and highest-profile actors – influential politicians, popular journalists and celebrities,” explained Jenny Reeves, NYU PhD in media, culture and communications and lead author of the report, in a statement.
“The bottom layer actors, then, are those who have more reach than the top actors. These individuals can often be considered micro-influencers – celebrities or political leaders’ fans with huge online followings, but not always in the traditional sense of the media.”
The study, which used algorithms to identify the most likely influencers from millions of candidates who may influence the discourse surrounding elections, found that elite-level social media users were as influential, if not more so, than the traditional media in the U.S. presidential election. The majority of influence was driven by individuals with 25,000 to 250,000 followers.
This fits with political science theory, which states that public opinion is a function of elites in politics, cultural elite and mass media.
For example, in a recent Vox article, Stanford University professor Douglas Kellner argued that some politicians were doing the “serious thinking” about how to exploit the public’s “ignor",519,4,2663

Samsara means ""wandering"" in Sanskrit and Pali. In Buddhism, it's often used as a metaphor for life in saṃsāra, the cycle of suffering and rebirth (pali: birth and death). The field of samsara, also called the illusion of samsara, is characterised by hardship, suffering and loss, entrapment and incessant change, and a sense of separation from the ""self"", or from other people. Samsara forms a part of the Buddhist teaching on the Four Noble Truths, which states that the origin of suffering is delusion.

As technology focuses on increasing efficiency, it often has less obvious effects on the quality of our lives. Because of its freedom from emotional connections, market forces can make us willing participants in choices we might find unacceptable.
No political party or presidential candidate can honestly claim that they are attempting to reverse or stop advances in technology. Most strongly liberal parties accept technology as an inevitable part of society. They favor advances in science and technology as a necessary requirement of liberty. Their assumption is that technological advancement is the means to a better world; this is almost never argued. The limitations of technology are not discussed. The revolutionary dimension of technological innovation has a lot in common with politics: both are dangerous! Technology can be a tool of the powers-that-be, which no one can escape; in politics, it is a tool of democracy and the promise of freedom. In the rhetoric of their supporters, it seems as though a fast computer can become a defender of democracy and justice. The quick harnessing of technology to a democratic purpose gives it importance it does not otherwise deserve.
Technology, however, is a tool, not a state of affairs or a goal. Among the uses of technology, however, are the uses that are inimical to democratic values and to freedom. In the arms race, in surveillance, in business competition, in consumerism, technology creates both problems and solutions. Among these technologies are the television, the fax machine, mail-order catalogs, the spy plane, computer systems, satellite photography and the Internet. These constitute a kind of technology monopoly, produced and controlled by large corporations and special interests. As liberal individuals it is often difficult to protect ourselves against the social influences these technologies present to us.
Any attempt to turn this large assortment of programs back to their own initial function is held in abeyance by “common sense.” The reason is, of course, that those who were seeking information for their own national interests have no knowledge or reasons to want to look at their own technology that produces and controls technology. They do not have a “common interest” in looking. They do not acknowledge the nature of that popular control, in keeping it from being exploited, and from concentrating into the hands of the few.

Of course, if you have the pantry full of luxuries, then by all means, by all means, enjoy! But cooking dishes from the garden is great, especially when you only have a few ingredients on hand. There's not much thinking involved in it because you already know you're going to put in a couple of locally grown ingredients in the recipe.
There is a delicate balance between food and pleasure, and the chef has the privilege to achieve that balance, adding new dimensions with each move of their knife. If you ever catch yourself watching an episode of the newest cooking show on television, just remember to enjoy the taste and appreciation of the food.
There is a perceived wisdom that food is at its best when it is cooked fresh from scratch. But there are many types of cooking that you may or may not be interested in. If you need a bit of inspiration to broaden your culinary horizons, here are 10 professional tips to start you off in the world of food preparation.
Food should be beautiful. Nothing is quite as captivating as a plate with something bold and beautiful on it. So spend time in the kitchen polishing your food presentation. The beauty of food is an expression of your taste, ingenuity and appreciation. Flowers, on the other hand, are beautiful when artfully presented. Flowers are used in displays of meringue and ice cream that look so good to eat that you feel tempted to lick them away. Nothing enhances the flavor of fruits or vegetables more than an artful arrangement of fresh flowers. Likewise, flowers can be included in any plating to create a balance of visual and visual appeal.
Flowers are not cheap, but they are worth their price. They must be carefully selected and placed in such a way that they complement the dish. If you are passionate about experimenting with flowers, you might also experiment with incorporating flowers as decorative items on your plate. You can use edible flowers such as roses, violets and calendulas, and top them off with a fruit, a sauce or an aromatic side dish. Arrange these on the plate using a variety of different flower types and colors to create a stunning appearance.

But it’s difficult to find posts that are for these practical examples, such as how to install the Python libraries? How to execute the pre-processing of data? How to deploy a Python trained model to some web servers? How to complete the deployment successfully? In this post, I will show you how to deploy a Python model on a web server. And the skills below are often needed for many websites where you can help your users get a friendlier online experience.
First, we should have the knowledge of Python on a server. Personally, I am a Linux user, and I will use CentOS 7 system. Here is the repository for CentOS 7 – https://github.com/centos/centos.
One of the most important skills I think is about the deployment process, and I will outline the skills below:
Decide the remote server of your application.
Install the Python libraries you need, such as the Tensorflow, Tensorflow Serving, and the Python Numpy
Create a Python web server
Deploy a Python trained model to the Python web server
Test the Python model on the remote server
Then you can execute your Python model.
So, you should ask yourself these questions in advance:
How you execute your remote service: I use Python, so I will develop a remote server with Python.
Who is your remote server: I need to execute my Python service on a remote server, such as AWS, Google, or Azure servers.
How you want to install the Python libraries: You should decide which type of the remote server you will use (Debian/ Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL, CentOS/RHEL, or Amazon Linux). Different server has different Python libraries and pre-configuration. Then install the necessary Python libraries that you will need on your server, such as Google Tensorflow, Tensorflow Serving, and Numpy.
How you execute the remote server: You can execute the server by using your IDE, such as Eclipse, IDEA, PyCharm, etc. And if you want to run your remote server in the background without any window or screen, you can run your script in the terminal or command line, such as using ssh to login your server, then open the terminal, and input the command below:

Why the Church can’t afford to ignore the workplace
Next week 46,000 church leaders will travel to Salt Lake City, Utah, to attend the biennial meetings of the World Congress of the International Confederation of Christian Churches, a confederation comprising 345 million members in more than 100 countries.
What they’ll be hearing about will have a strong business and entrepreneurial orientation. Up to 15 percent of the world’s population now live as entrepreneurs and small business owners. Christianity has long been influential in business history, and numbers among the “big four” religions of the world (Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism) whose followers are major contributors in the international commerce, industry, and management. These trends show no sign of abating.
In recent decades the Church has increasingly recruited business professionals into ministries of care and compassion around the world: among them are doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, broadcasters, and other experts and administrators. Further increasing the significance of professional business people within the Church, some people with Ph.D.’s and postdoctoral research qualifications are discovering their true callings as pastors, educators, mission leaders, and evangelists in local congregations.
Why do we need to make business more relevant in the Church? Growing numbers of business professionals are presenting the same call: God wants to restore the marketplaces as we understand them to Christian stewardship. The Church, they argue, has missed a golden opportunity by not taking on a greater role in the Church’s mission. The sooner the Church changes the better.
Taking the long view, business is a subculture.
Business is not part of the Church, but it’s a culture that is embedded within. It has its own values, language, and manners. Yet many of its values and practices conflict with Christian tenets. There has never been a better time for the Church to restore its credibility with the business world. Jesus shone a light on this world and spoke the truth about the market economy that has changed everything. He was correct in his critique, and his lifestyle—a self-sacrificing lifestyle of creating value to support others—changed the world. For the Church, businesses are a challenging but vital arm to mobilize to the mission. “The kingdom of God is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.” (Matthew 13:45) As disciples of Jesus Christ we must interpret and manage business with the Word of God, not with the Word of the world.

Whether you're a nonbinary, transgender, or cisgender person, an MTF transexual person, or a transitioning person, you may have concerns about your healthcare. The main healthcare concerns are:
Unfortunately, many MTFs are afraid to get checked. They fear that their body may look very feminine (chest), that their hormone therapy may not have worked, or that their ""purpose"" has changed. This is why many MTFs try to keep their breasts hidden by using long, short hair, baggy clothing, high collars and an abundance of other accessories. However, these breasts don't work well with clothing and accessories, so many people try to change their breasts to something else. One common problem with changing breasts is that your breasts will shrink over time. Another problem is that your breasts will ""gasp"" which can make your breasts look too big.
When it comes to MTFs, there are a few different opinions on the best way to change breasts. Some people think that it's best to use no-touch breast implant devices, while others think that breast augmentation is the best way to go.
Breast augmentation is a type of plastic surgery procedure where breast tissue is replaced with implants to enhance the appearance of breasts. The procedure is generally done in two parts, which can take up to two years. Once the implants are in place, the surgeon closes the incision and removes the incision tissue.
Breast augmentation is done on an outpatient basis and takes around three hours, though this depends on the surgeon's experience. After the procedure, you will be given medications for pain and nausea.
Breast augmentation is a procedure in which a woman's breasts are surgically enlarged or enlarged in size. The breasts are most commonly enlarged by using a surgical implant. The implant is usually made of silicone, however, in recent years, some doctors have begun using a liquid, called liquid silicone. The implant is usually filled with saline, a salt solution, and is placed inside the breast, where it will be used to enlarge the breast.
Breast implant surgery is done under general anesthesia and takes approximately three to six weeks for the breasts to fully heal and return to normal size. The procedure is usually painless and requires little recovery time. However, some patients may have a lot of pain in their breasts, which can last for up to several months.

# Polynomials

What is a polynomial in cryptography?

A polynomial is a mathematical object that generalises integer multiplication; instead of multiplying two variables together (ex. $a * b$), we multiply them in layers. Take the following examples:

• $a * b$ where $a = 2 * 3$ and $b = 3 * 1$ will get the result: $a * b = (2 * 3) * (3 * 1) = 2 * (3 * 1) = 2 * 3 = 6$
• $a * b$ where $a = 2 * 3 * 4$ and $b = 3 * 1 * 5$ will get the result: $a * b = (2 * 3 * 4) * (3 * 1 * 5) = 2 * (3 * 1) * 4 * 5 = 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 2 * 3 * 20 = 12 * 20 = 240$

Note that every layer of multiplication has (potentially) different values being multiplied, yet adding up those results will give the original value. The number of layers is the degree of the polynomial, and in this example, the degree is equal to $4$.

## Application to cryptography

Now let's try and re-apply that same concept to cryptography. Earlier, we looked at multiplication with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. In order to calculate the shared secret value, we first generate a random value $p = a * b$ and then take the discrete logarithm of it ($a * b = g^{a * b} \mod p$ where $g$ is a generator and $g^{a * b}$ is derived as above).

Theoretically, this value is calculated using the following polynomial equation:

$$p = a * b \mod n$$

Indeed, the value $n$ is the modulus. This is different from integer multiplication because $n$ is always an odd number. But doesn't that also mean that $a * b \mod n$ will always be even, and thus will not resolve to $p$?

Fortunately, the polynomial equation can be manipulated in the following way (note that it could also be written as $p - a * b \mod n$):

Quantum mechanics is one of the most important and fundamental scientific theories of the modern era. It has fundamentally changed our understanding of the world around us, including how atoms, particles, and even light function. As a result, it has profound implications for numerous fields, including medicine, energy, and communications.

In medicine, quantum mechanics is being applied to develop new treatments for various diseases. For example, researchers are using quantum computing to simulate molecular interactions and predict the effects of different drugs on the human body. This can help researchers identify new drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects.

In the field of energy, quantum mechanics is being used to develop new technologies that could revolutionize the way we generate and use energy. For example, researchers are exploring the use of quantum dots to improve solar cells, which could lead to more efficient and cost-effective solar power. Quantum mechanics is also being used to develop new materials with unique properties, such as superconductors and topological insulators, which could lead to breakthroughs in energy storage and distribution.

Finally, quantum mechanics is playing an increasingly important role in communications technology, as researchers develop new quantum communication protocols that could be used to transmit information more securely and efficiently than ever before. This includes the development of quantum key distribution, which uses the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure that communication is secure and unbreakable.

In conclusion, quantum mechanics has far-reaching implications for modern society, and its impact can be seen in numerous fields. From medicine to energy to communications, the principles of quantum mechanics are being applied to push the boundaries of what is possible and drive progress in numerous areas.",346,4,2007

After the professionals that care for Clinton Correctional Facility's rehabilitative program were unable to fully accept a request to use music as a therapeutic tool with the facility's residents, we created a new goal for the music therapy program. As a music therapist, I tried to fulfill this goal with our residents for over three years. My constant and determined desire to see their hard work rewarded with the new goal they had been requested to pursue was met with lack of support.
I remember an almost identical situation in 1992 while doing an internship at Lewis County Correctional Facility in WA State. I walked into my first group session excited about the possibility of providing music therapy and my excitement was met by a guarded lawyer from the counseling department. I was expecting to be welcomed with open arms but this attorney requested I not be in the group room and told the group and support staff that they should not speak with me because she didn't believe in my program. I was stunned at first and when I processed this news and requested to see the superintendent, he said ""well, I can see that a music therapist may not be the right choice for this situation and I don't feel comfortable letting you in there either.""
The combination of denial of funding for music therapists, lack of willingness of facility leadership to support music therapy, even despite these challenges, created a music therapy program that continued to assist the Clinton Facility's residents in their rehabilitation process. A few examples of this could be found in the behavior chart and therapeutic note section of this paper.

ML pipelines (or a combined pipeline and flow) is a way to easily organize work in Azure ML that makes it easier to write and share your code. ML pipelines (and the flow component) allow you to manually iterate over your code and use tags as you go. Your work can then be organized and run again without having to copy/paste code.

# The Architecture of Azure Machine Learning Pipelines

A big part of ML pipelines is the components list, which you add and edit to complete your machine learning analysis. The components are organized from top to bottom in your pipeline and contain the following sections.

1. A location field allows you to enter the URL of the AML Workspace and/or the URL of a DataFlow to use. These AML workspaces and DataFlows live in the Azure Portal (in the \Azure ML Studio tab).
2. The Script section describes the relevant pieces of code you want to execute.
3. A tags field contains relevant metadata about your component and the project. Tags can either be created during the initial pipeline or uploaded and related to an existing project.

ML pipelines are essentially collections of components with tags added to those components so that they can be run individually or all together. Let's create an example to try this out.

Note that a new component added to an AML pipeline or a flow will be considered the parent (active) component for that component only. Hence, you will not have parent/child components within a pipeline, even though you can have multiple pipelines that have different components from the same parent component. In essence, there will be two components in two separate pipelines when you run these components in a new pipeline.

To create a pipeline or flow, click on the View or Flow tab and click on the button on the top bar labeled New. Once you select New there are two options - create a Pipeline or a Flow. We will demonstrate the Pipeline flow, as the process is similar for the Flow.

Now you can customize the components. Create a new component by right-clicking on the Components section and click Add Component. If you are familiar with Azure ML, these components include a Name (with a default name, which you can change), a Description (a longer-form description for the component), and a type (for example, you could select Python or Text to string).

After creating your component, you can add parameters to it by right-click",518,4,2477

How they work, when to take them and why your doctor might hesitate
Travel clinics, pharmacies and hospitals now provide travelers with up-to-date and comprehensive medical advice and a veritable world of vaccinations. But vaccine manufacturers don't test or qualify shots for use in other countries, so doctors and nurses are in the difficult position of having to make educated guesses about which vaccines to recommend, or if they need to recommend any at all. ""A lot of infections that come from abroad can have signs and symptoms that can mimic a cold or gastroenteritis,"" says Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at HealthLink BC. ""So even if you get a good vaccine, it might not be doing much for you.""
The struggle to create preventative vaccines that don't have serious side effects could be contributing to this lack of information. Vaccine makers have experimented with using dog, cat and cow proteins, enzymes and genetic material, all of which could make people sick. ""The science of infectious disease vaccines is relatively new,"" says Kahn. ""But we've come a long way.""
Nonetheless, because there are still major hurdles to vaccinating people with live viruses that can replicate and mutate, some vaccines are often a better solution than their live counterparts. That's where travelers' vaccinations come in: unlike live vaccines, which require six months or longer to produce the desired level of immunity, they can be administered immediately.

Newton's superposition principle, developed in his Principia Mathematica, accepted by the Royal Society and even recognized in Europe, which demanded that the Age of the Earth be as great as the duration of the human life span, 100 to 120 years, as reported in the Principia is categorically rejected. Some of the fundamental laws of science rejected were the law of homology, the law of homogeneity, the law of homogeneity, the law of reflexivity, the law of simplicity, the law of experimentation, the law of evidence and the law of experimentation.
Instead, Lyell ""proposed"", based on astrology, that the Earth has existed in all its present glory since ""millions of years."" This launched an attack on the status of Newton, Galileo, Kepler and the Royal Society, which for the first time in their existence, remained as isolated and idle as were the elementary school teachers, with no science. astronomy nor chemistry.
All the science of light and matter which had been introduced at that time by Newton - optics, mechanics, gravitation - was declared so supernatural and mystical that researchers with this knowledge were considered to be madmen, and ""obscurantists.""
However, it was not enough to reject all the physical principles of science, as Newton and his disciples had established them for more than two centuries, but the physical standards of beauty in physics and the physical standards of beauty as a standard of beauty in nature had to be abandoned.
This is what Lyell's alter ego, Simon Newcomb, declared with pompous self-confidence, to whom the reader should be alerted:
""There is no aspect of the universe to which we can refer for enjoyment and material content, not only of science, but also of art and poetry, than to the heavenly bodies and the geometry of space and time.""

Our brain is made up of 2 separate parts: the left and the right. The left part of our brain handles the logical and analytical side of our personality and the right handles the creative and intuitive. Because the logic-based left side of our brain controls and manages emotions, a variety of mental conditions arise. The condition that we will discuss today is anxiety. Anxiety is a mental condition that arises when a person becomes fearful over situations, things, or people.
This condition affects a lot of people as statistics show that 30% of the world’s population experiences some sort of anxiety. In the United States alone, roughly 40 million people have anxiety every year.
Symptoms of anxiety include trembling, feeling stressed, light-headed, dizzy, fast heartbeat, fast or irregular breathing, sweating, feeling shaky, nausea, and a feeling of panic. Different people experience different types of anxiety. The most common type of anxiety is stress. According to the latest research, stress is the reason why 60% of people quit their job because they are not able to meet the demands of their job. It is also the main reason why 1 in 5 people suffer from health problems.
On the other hand, if we want to take control of our anxiety, we must know the main cause behind the anxiety. In this article, we will not tell you what is anxiety, but we will let you understand how you can overcome your anxiety through taking care of your brain.
This is really important because this is the cause of your anxiety. Our brain is programmed to handle only what is expected of us. If our brain is exposed to something new or there are a lot of things happening all at once, it can get overwhelmed. This is a normal feeling that happens every time our brain is challenged and exposed to new things.
For example, a person may become anxious when he knows that he will be working in a different country. His brain may think that it is the end of the world and that he cannot accept this new challenge and would just rather quit his current job.
Overcoming anxiety involves overcoming the way our brain responds to unexpected situations. This means that it is important to trust ourselves in whatever we do. It is important to be prepared for whatever you will face because you are more than",504,4,2532

Over the past few years, there has been an explosion of data about a person's genetic makeup. Today, you can order a DNA test and, in a matter of weeks, receive information about all the different things that affect your health, including your predisposition to disease, how much caffeine you can safely drink, if you're prone to an addiction and even your blood type. As these DNA testing companies reveal your genetic traits and health details, people sometimes have misconceptions about their usefulness.
A sample of DNA from an individual being tested. Even while having a genetic test done, some people still don't understand the worth of them.
Misconceptions about genetic testing
1. Genetic testing is always beneficial.
The applications of genetic testing are still mostly in their infancy and many are not ready for prime time. Although genetic testing can explain complex disease outcomes, many of these disease are not avoidable. Thus, genetic testing is not a completely reliable resource when it comes to avoiding disease and the meaning of your individual genetic testing data will depend on what type of testing you do.
2. People should take advantage of all the tests.
People who don't yet understand genetic testing may feel compelled to take advantage of any and every test available. This is a mistake. Some companies have invented ""gene drives"" to ensure they can reach millions of people with lots of product to sell. That's why thousands of gene tests are available, but only a few are based on clear scientific value.
3. Genetics is black and white.
We live in a society that believes in ""black and white"" solutions to everyday problems. Genetic testing is no different. There is a big difference between knowing what your risk of disease might be, and actually being able to lower your risk by doing something different.
4. If you don't get genetic testing, you can't benefit from it.
Genetic testing has one distinct advantage over other available testing: it can be used at any point in your life. A downside is that the data can quickly become obsolete. By the time your results are ready, your genetic makeup may have changed so the information may not be useful. If you test now, will it help you tomorrow? Only time will tell.
5. A genetic test can tell you everything you need to know.
Take heart from the fact that information about your genetic health is not always as straightforward as it might seem. For example, if your mother was diagnosed with cancer, your risk of getting the same disease may actually decrease. The amount of information about how",524,4,2609
1482,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," research is a burgeoning field. Practitioners of AI may feel an ethical responsibility, guided by a certain ideal, to use AI in alignment with societal goals. Fairness, and not just technical correctness, can be one such ideal. Most respondents to the new Cloud to Edge Survey Report from research and advisory firm Gartner agree that the power imbalance between AI developers and AI end users needs to be addressed. Respondents feel there is a need for a human in the loop, particularly when it comes to AI safety, ownership and equity.
Some worry that AI will produce biased and unfair results if developers don’t include ethical considerations. In fact, several senior executives at an event in Switzerland in September 2018 surveyed by SAP AG said AI could help promote human rights and deliver on the United Nations’ (U.N.’s) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The initial step in any discussion about the ethical application of AI is to define terms. While debates around the ethics of AI can turn ad-hoc, to be taken seriously, the definition of ethical AI must be concrete.
Sangiacomo suggests data scientists and engineers in enterprises approach the ethical development of AI as they approach the development of any new technology. The ethics behind their AI systems should be reviewed and addressed at all stages of the development process, from infrastructure, integration, and user interface to ongoing monitoring and maintenance. “The technology needed to be developed in accordance with the overall design philosophy,” Sangiacomo says.
Here are the three ethical technologies to which enterprises should look first, followed by three technologies that are less cutting edge but can make a lasting ethical impact.
The decision-making based on an algorithm learned from historical data is commonplace. “An algorithm is data-driven. It learns from past data. That means if the data is biased, the algorithm is biased,” Sangiacomo says. Even in well-designed data centers, there are risks in using an algorithm from the cloud.
For example, claims data is used to train fraud-detection algorithms. Data collected in high fraud areas may cause predictions based on training sets to have higher error rates. If such data is used in the formation of fraud detection algorithms, then the algorithms may be skewed to hold a bias against certain ethnicities.
“In general, that might be because certain segments in society have been historically more likely to commit fraud in certain industries. So, if the algorithm is learning from the past, then it’s going to use that data, which will learn the new solution to be biased,” Sangiacomo says.

However, the basics get tangled up in the technical jargon when the camera guy says, ""The [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] is too exposed and the [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] is too dark""
What the hell? Why do the [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] sound like something that won't ever get better?
To explain what the [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] is, and to explain why the [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] is worse than white being pure white and black being pure black.
In old film photography, one could use [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] gel filters for the film itself in various combinations.
Each filter had a threshold of one color against another.
With black and white film, you would typically put a [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] filter directly in front of the lens as the first filter in a stack. A [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] filter in front of white and red will make red become [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] with the first in front being [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] and black of course will become white. This causes [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] to be a pure white and black is pure black. On a negative, when you are looking into the negative with a loupe, you won't be able to tell where black is on the negative but you will see white and cyan as white with less and less of them until you can't see them at all, which is black. So this is where all the camera guy technical jargon about [Cyan|Orange|Magenta|Green|Red] comes from.
On an image sensor with a Bayer filter, you are looking at a series of tiny images representing only one color of the photo. And because of how the images are taken, black and white looks like this.
Remember: White is actually RED. Red is actually YELLOW. Yellow is actually GREEN. Green is actually CYAN.
So all the camera guy is trying to do is straighten out the image so all the colors are where they should be.

When I started learning more on the subject of quantum mechanics (usually also called ""physics"") I found it difficult to get started. For example, I can't understand what $x$, $p$ and $\hbar$ are for.

All texts start with classical physics (Newtonian Mechanics) and then say, look quantum mechanics is new, this is what it means: $x = 3$, $p = 5$, $\hbar = 0.5$.

But what is $x$? What is $p$? What is $\hbar$? I'm not saying that's the best way to begin, but perhaps the parts concerning 'elementary' stuff in quantum physics need a better introduction. A high school level introduction would probably help a lot.

There are also topics that are maybe trivial to you, but very important to me: I believe that when you explain stuff to someone, you should say what they know beforehand, not afterwards: this makes things harder.

I know of a couple of introductory books on the matter (Bohm and Streater, Feynman, etc), which are great for deep insight, but I'd like a 'by the numbers' approach, as if you were explaining everything to somebody else. How can I get this? Did I miss something on quantum mechanics when I learned high school physics? Is there a good, fun, basic, textbook on this matter?

• A few questions can be found here: first, second, third. – Dilaton Jan 12 '14 at 10:13
• To begin you don't need to learn anything about quantum mechanics to begin with. The classical explanation can be misleading, because it was originally thought to be a classical theory but eventually it was found that it was a mathematical theory. The primary theory that you have to learn is single particle quantum mechanics, the mathematical theory that uses linear algebra and complex number. Then you have the uncertainty principle, that is essential. – Dilaton Jan 12 '14 at 10:16
• In physics, it's very common to give simple examples rather than doing an elementary introduction. To do so, you need to be aware of what your audience is familiar with. A high school level introduction might well lead people astray. What is elementary for one person is not for another. – Kyle Kanos Jan 12 '14 at 10:29

Instead of being real, ""metaphysical"" things are just complex metaphors. Mythical explanations can still make us sense our limitations in the universe without overwhelming our optimism. These are common, understandable, understandable ideas, which can be philosophised with a little imagination.

The misnomer that philosophy is part of ""natural science"" is due to the misunderstanding of Plato and Aristotle's approaches, which originally laid the foundation for the discipline.

Personally, as a layperson, I am for human rights, democracy, and individual liberty as a lot more important than anything else. I don't even understand the appeal of philosophy, really. As a philosopher, I care only about the big questions, ie. could God exist? could consciousness be simulated? Can sentience exist without a brain? Can an AI find itself?

Francisco, you seem to be conflating philosophy with psychology, especially in the sections on psychology and atheism. There is a genuine distinction between philosophy and psychology, and I wish you'd consider that within both sections on psychology and atheism you have misrepresented or erred on the side of psychological ideas as philosophy. You note the distinction between psychology, sociology and anthropology, but fall in to the same trap in your section on philosophy and religion.

Philosophy isn't about Psychology. I'm not sure what our respective professions are, but I'm not a psychologist. We speak a completely different language. Take Aristotle as an example. He thought his universe could be described with the least amount of mathematical terms, because he didn't understand geometry. He also asked the first question in philosophy, ""what is an absolute?"" There's a very specific meaning of science there, and its not at all psychological. While he certainly had a very unscientific mindset, not accepting much less supernatural is a sign of great insight, even today. In short, he's one of the founding fathers of our foundations of knowledge. It would be nice if philosophers could understand that while there are many psychological answers, there are no philosophical ones.

This has allowed detailed statistical analyses of house numbers, numbers of graves, as well as skeletal, ceramic and stone inventories to be undertaken. The treasurers of those who died within the temple and near the buildings of mortuary feasting shows that belonging to this group was a significant function for individuals. Expanding this information to the household and inter-household level allows the way in which the community viewed the dead, their labours and the transmission of values and wealth across the generations to be explored. The Numinia community is expressed not only as a kin-based social entity but one which was conditioned by other principalities. The results of palaeo-ethno-archaeological analyses are combined with field survey in order to expand the analysis further into the larger surrounding landscape and to identify additional temples, prehistoric burials, henge monuments, later ritual activity and settlements, the function of which may be clarified. This third of three parts provides a methodology with which to contextualise archaeological data. It has revealed how individuals were important to the transmission of values, and community organisations from generation to generation.

Video games and dancing together is not something I’ve seen anywhere near as often as I’d expect, and something I’m sure could be done a lot more in most contemporary games.

As a designer, I’m fascinated by this as a potential win-win: for danceability to be added as a core design output, we can step beyond the habits we normally have of only thinking about audio through a ‘fun, pleasurable, noise’ lens.

Firstly, games actually now are embracing a lot more abstract sensory experience, if you look at sensory games like Tilt Brush. Auditory games however are still lagging behind, as they are by and large still designed with heavy sound effects, and more traditional instrumentation.

To get there, it might help to start with the music as input. Music theory relies on the composer on knowing a number of concrete things about the instruments to even be able to write the music down, and to know where it’s going to go.

Modern game audio designers, at the very least, aim to re-use sound effects and music as extensively as possible, mixing them together to create a coherent whole. It would be a much more interesting challenge to begin with data about each instrument instead.

This could eventually lead to a vision where game musicians, audio composers, and sound designers (and as the name makes you expect, video game developers as well) could very naturally start to add sound experiments which are based around ergonomics of the instruments used.

An idea might be to use band instruments, with good tuning so they can easily be played in the same key, but to create semi-random stems and instruments which can be played, to replicate the audible effects of a band. For example, in Karaoke, using two keyboards would give you bass notes and lead, rather than sampling a regular bass and keyboard player.

A desirable outcome would be to have music which had new, stylistically unique, humanly-playable instruments which could have very different playing styles. If keyboards were plugged in, then you might find wind or string musicians playing keyboards in tune and changing the kind of musician, beyond the scope of games which just randomly drop different instruments into the mix.

This kind of research is still in it’s infancy (and is actually a long way from even a full direction that makes any kind of sense), but I’m excited about the possibilities!

C = 2 $\pi$ r

We can calculate the length of one complete rotation around a circle with a diameter D= 1:

And, have also produced a new way to live healthy, safe and also efficient. The way of living has become a lot easy that we humans had probably not even dreamt of. Obviously, if we think of the basics, we have realized things that are somewhat in close association with technology. The historical past of technology as well as science must involve lots of detailed discussion in addition to a research how technology is changing the way we conduct our lives. But for now, let us just consider a glance at a few intriguing facts about technology.
A non-alcoholic beverage called ""Alka-Seltzer"" began its journey in the early 19th century and very first produced into the world in 1931. Created by G.D. Searle Company, this non-alcoholic medicine was founded in 1876 for the treatment of various stomach problems including liver ailments. Alka-Seltzer is marketed as a non-alcoholic drink in the very beginning. Then in 1967, the company created another item in the market which was applied medicine without any added flavor to treat body aches, the remedy of heartburns, upset stomachs and more.
We can also praise technology for the introduction of job post websites. Previously a lot of time was used in faxing resumes, or making separate phone calls to job postings.

Since the beginning of 2019, the number of theaters, in which films are shown, has been constantly decreasing. Therefore, digital distribution platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, HBO, etc. are gaining more and more popularity each day.
The research analyzes the problem of effective marketing of American films in the presence of digital distribution platforms for several years. In the course of the work, the main challenges that a film industry and film producers face are identified. It is concluded that a long-term impact of the constant decrease of theaters on the release and distribution of films has already been shown. The study has focused on the factors that influence the perception of movies, and ways to increase the quality of such perception are considered. Experts in the field of marketing and industry representatives are consulted, which allows to identify trends in the film distribution industry.
The research results show that the use of popular social networks is the most promising way to increase the quality and relevance of films presented by movie theaters. The recommendations of this work can help investors and producers to avoid negative financial losses in the near future.

He is an artist from the Munich artists’ colony. Henningsen’s language not only underscores the ubiquity of the modern technological and industrial means available to the artist, but also, strikingly, the strong contrast between a strictly personal experience of art, contained in this painting, and the array of spectators present in the foreground. The audience is totally disconnected from the artist and his work, and as he is suspended in time, everything can only be understood from the outside. But his work is not isolated; it manifests itself in dialogue and a sense of being with others. Is he then just a successful figure of historical determination or an expression of the very physiology of the human soul in the modern age? Ernst Henningsen was interested in this predicament in the history of his century: although he produced many paintings depicting the daily activities of his friends, the context of his work is historical and intrinsically future-oriented. In his final years he knew that a fundamental change was coming, and like Marc Chagall, was able to be connected to this ‘great transformation’ to come by painting it. Henningsen’s work is full of premonitions of the forthcoming flowering of technology and the blurring of the distinction between the interior life and the outer world. During this seminar, Dr Tzortzis, who will be introduced by Prof. Linda Woodhead (Lancaster University), will show that life as the experience of an exchange of signals between the past and the future, today, is up for discussion. The observation that modern technology, far from being a threat to religion, actually opens the door to a new type of religious experience will also be raised in this event.

Environment variables in PHP are variables that hold values that can be accessed and used throughout a PHP script. These variables are defined using the `define()` or the `putenv()` function and are called environmental variables.

To set an environment variable in PHP, you can use the `define()` function. Here's an example:

define(""DB_USER"", ""username"");
define(""DB_PASSWORD"", ""password"");

In this example, we define two environment variables named ""DB_USER"" and ""DB_PASSWORD"" with their respective values. These variables can now be used throughout the PHP script.

To retrieve the value of an environment variable, you can simply use its name as a string within a PHP script. Here's an example:

$user = DB_USER;
$pass = DB_PASSWORD;

echo ""Database username: "" . $user;
echo ""Database password: "" . $pass;

In this example, we retrieve the values of the ""DB_USER"" and ""DB_PASSWORD"" environment variables using the `define()` function and use them to perform database operations.

Using environment variables in PHP can be beneficial for storing sensitive information such as database credentials or API keys, as these variables can be defined and accessed within the script without exposing the actual values.",297,4,1322

For the education sector, which has traditionally relied on live sessions, offline classes, and homework assignments, the transformation is forcing it to embrace digital as an essential part of student learning.
Similarly, the new business development landscape requires enabling technology and digital knowledge to reach prospective clients. Companies that have built their revenue streams around classroom training as their primary driver of revenue, have now been forced to sell all online.
In short, marketing and sales have taken a new meaning in the digital age. The need to promote yourself and your offerings, attract clients, create awareness, attract leads, build relationships, and get them on board is all the more essential.
The same problem of digital readiness exists in the role of education in the corporate world. Large sections of the corporate workforce have been inactive for a year and a half, with teachers left unsatisfied. The education sector in the 21st century has become an integral part of corporate culture, with the aim of skill-building and industry alignment.
That said, for graduates who do not possess digital skills or the skills required for the workplace, the future prospects have become bleak. This has a long-term effect on their job opportunities and their chances of being competitive in the global workforce.

According to the Times of India survey, a large percentage of employees were in favor of taking online training, a view that is strongly supported by their managers and HR heads. For the education industry, this means that they have to shift their focus on digital education to meet the evolving needs of the employee.

You may have heard people claim that chemistry isn't relevant to your day-to-day life, that it's only for scientists, or that you will never need to use anything you learned in chemistry. You don't have to be a scientist to enjoy a beautiful sunset, hear music that touches your soul, or share a meal with a friend. All these things involve chemistry in some form or another. Making music involves chemistry in the sound waves and frequencies that we are able to perceive; preparing food involves chemistry as you determine which foods do what to your body; sunset colors involve reflection and scattering of light from the atmosphere; and we eat because of chemistry. You might need a broader understanding of these processes than you think, so think again and understand that chemistry can be fun and fascinating. Here are the most common misconceptions about chemistry and learning chemistry.
It is boring
You will rarely be asked what speed of light does in chemistry class. You won’t be tested on the number of atoms in a single molecule of sodium, nor will you find yourself calculating the pH of a water sample. However, chemistry has a significant impact on everyday living. Just think about how many things depend on chemistry that you use on a daily basis. Chemistry is the science that enables things such as energy production, drinkable water, food safety, drug efficacy, defense in wartime, and a less polluted environment. As that indicates, chemistry is important to your everyday living. Chemistry has real-life applications in everything you do.
It's too hard
Chemistry is difficult. It can be challenging at times, but it does not have to be overwhelming. You can make chemistry as easy or difficult as you like. As in all fields of study, you need to decide what your motivation is. You need to decide the type of reward that you will get for your effort and how much effort you want to put forth. Reward yourself at all levels, from memorizing a concept, to understanding a concept, to being able to explain a concept in different words or situations. No matter what level of chemistry you begin with, you will learn new things and experience new things about nature. By learning chemistry and new concepts, you will increase your brain function and allow yourself to be on an infinite learning curve. Every concept you learn now will have a foundation on which to build upon future understandings. I encourage you to use the sun screen and sunscreen lotions every day.

Though they may not be the core formulas, they are still considered useful and students should still know them.
There are various formulas that can be used to help you find the distance to the object. These formulas are used to calculate the distance from a light to an object. One common way of measuring the distance between objects is by the use of geometry. Geometry is a very useful tool because it can be used to find the area of triangles and squares. It is also one of the easiest and fastest ways to get the measurement of a triangle. However, for a square or rectangle, it is better to use a ruler. A square can only measure angles and triangles. However, a rectangle can measure straight sides. A rectangle can be measured by adding the length of a side to the perimeter and dividing it by two.
Another useful method is the use of a straight line. This is when a line is traced along a path that does not intersect any other object or point. This is how we get the measurement of a straight line. Straight lines are the simplest of all geometry because it does not intersect anything. It is also one of the easiest ways to measure distances. It is important to note that a straight line is not the same as a straight line. A straight line is a line in which the ends are not coincident with the same point on a line. A straight line does not intersect any object. However, a straight line is a line in which the ends are coincident. A straight line is a line in which the ends are the same point on a line. A straight line is a line in which the ends are not coincident with each other.

1510,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are currently taking a significant step forward thanks to laser-based 3D lidar technologies. Typical lidar technologies are based on illumination with a continuous wave beam and the reception of these in reflected back to the lidar unit. In simple systems, the angle and range information is derived from the time of flight differences between two or more pulses sent out. In a laser radar design, similar information is derived by comparing the phase information in one or more pulses to a reference waveform. Both approaches lead to the same range information; however, the phase measurement offers higher information content per spatial volume and, thus, resolution of 3D information on a much larger scale in comparison to other range sensor technologies. Several different approaches of laser-based 3D range imaging techniques are being currently introduced on the market.
Typical lidar sensors, using a step and ramp modulated active laser as illumination, were early adopters in this game. Using a pulse frequency greater than 100 MHz, ranges to most objects have been easily obtained. The object is conveniently sampled point-by-point (e.g. 1000 points per range) through these single point measurements. This, in combination with the inherent 360o field of view of this laser radar technology, results in a polar representation of the measured 3D object. To overcome the 1-dimensionality of polar representations, radially distributed holograms have been used. Spreading the range information at the receiver into space by additional interferometric lens arrangements has led to the development of 3D scanners, used in security applications.
Another type of laser radar sensor is based on the measurement of phase information. The pulse trains are pre-spread over time by a chirp modulation, and thus provide additional information on the temporal phase (reference waveform is fixed).
Adopting the intracavity frequency doubling of telecom technology, and hence a fiber laser platform, with an extended wavelength range, an impulse chirp laser technology has been developed, featuring high range of 400m @850mW with 25mrad angle resolution.
Many system components, in particular commercial sensors, are time-gated. By tightly synchronizing the system time with the laser pulse frequency the time-gate pulse duration can be reduced. Because of the reduced time-gate laser radar range in detection is increased by the same amount. Compact laser radar devices can be realized in this way in which a fixed angle resolution and a selectable time-gate length are the key parameters. These laser radar systems",496,4,2612

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a popular buzzword in our current digital times. We hear and read about it frequently and actively follow its newest advancements. However, do you know what AI is? What is its purpose? What is its algorithm? What is its architecture? These are just a few questions we’re going to attempt to answer in this article.

Most people are not professional AI researchers, nor AI practitioners (data scientists), and many of them do not have a scientific background. These common people view AI technology as magic. They see it as an omnipresent and mysterious technology that promises artificial mind that could eventually act like a human one. It is understandable why many people tend to have such perception of AI technology. Most of their knowledge about AI is merely about its application like Chat-GPT or GPT-3, which were trained on huge datasets and achieve impressive performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This makes AI seem like a technology that emerged out of nowhere. This is unfortunate because even many programmers and web designers think of AI technology like chatbots, which are a small part of it.

To understand AI and its actual purpose, let’s make an analogy. Though both wind and birds fly, we are able to distinguish the two by knowing the underlying technology that helps them flying. Wind is invisible air but it allows air to create continuous flow that pushes or pulls an object in a smooth manner. Air creates a massive flow at a relatively slow speed (e.g. flying birds). On the other hand, the bird is a physical object that flies on its own and moves around space. This process of moving around is called locomotion. Both wind and bird flying rely on the interaction with the atmosphere. However, their purpose is different.

According to the traditional definition, wind is a movement of air created by a movement of mass of another object or a result of interactions with the atmosphere of the Earth. Wind has natural origins (e.g. the Sun’s heat, Earth’s rotation and storms), while birds are an artificial movement of an entity. Both wind and birds are moving around in the same volume of atmosphere. Birds, however, are created and change their posture, direction and speed while moving in the atmosphere. This is different from wind that is not determined by the movement of its sources but is produced to create an atmospheric flow. Similarly, a bird keeps moving around in the atmosphere to interact with it. This is different from wind that produces atmospheric flow. Birds are moving around in the atmosphere to interact with it.",527,4,2616

Ancient Egypt, which spanned from 3100 BC to 332 BC, was a civilization where literature flourished for over two thousand years. The earliest written texts from ancient Egypt were inscribed on the walls of temples and tombs using hieroglyphics, a system of writing using symbols and pictures.

The history of literature in ancient Egypt dates back to the Old Kingdom Period (2686-2181 BC). During this time, a significant amount of literature was produced, including religious texts and hymns, philosophical texts, and scientific texts. Religious texts such as the Book of the Dead and the Book of the Two Ways were popular during this time. These texts described rituals, spells, and prayers that were necessary for the afterlife.

In the Middle Kingdom Period (2055-1650 BC), literature became more widespread in various forms. During this period, literature focused on the royal courts and court life. The historical records of the Middle Kingdom Period are also considered to be some of the earliest forms of literature in ancient Egypt.

In the New Kingdom Period (1550-1070 BC), literature flourished even more, with epic poems and hymns being created during this period. The most famous of these epic poems was the Story of Sinuhe, a tale of a loyal subject of the pharaoh who was exiled and rose to power again.

By the Late Period (720-332 BC), literature had declined, and only a few surviving texts remain. However, during the Ptolemaic Period (305-30 BC), the influence of Greek literature could be seen in Egyptian literature, including the New Kingdom texts.

Overall, the history of literature in ancient Egypt highlights the importance of religion, court life, and epic tales in Egyptian culture. The literature produced during this time served as a foundation for literary traditions that would continue throughout Egyptian history.

Biology has brought about some magnificent things, like the development of medical techniques that have saved a billion lives, or the flowering of human civilization as cities became denser and interconnected networks of commerce and politics came to dominate the landscape. But at the same time, biology has unleashed forces beyond our control, from genetic engineering to the massive depletion of natural resources that could lead to the extinction of natural species, and in some cases, human life itself.
All of these ways of looking at biology don’t just happen in isolation. We could say that the art world turns to biological references in the same way that fantasy and science fiction do. That’s when we run into a problem. By considering and treating biology itself in terms of anthropomorphic forms, it’s difficult to escape the illusion that biology itself is the result of a human process.
So, how do artists see biology? In all honesty, it’s not something they can easily ignore. For many artists, biology is a source of inspiration and a starting point in the process of creation. If we don’t put ourselves in the shoes of the person trying to create an artwork, it’s hard to tell what the person is really thinking about or how their psyche works. So, is it easier to develop an object of art, or to create an artwork based on a scientific discipline? There are a lot of examples of artists creating artworks that were inspired by biology, and if you’re willing to look beyond the technical details of the biology, then you’ll discover an artist whose work is unique. There are a number of unique artists whose work can be seen in a biological context.
As artists, the way we experience our environment is different from the way we experience the natural world. We may see an artwork that represents an idea, but we may be unable to put a name to that idea. For this reason, we can see that an artwork may be about a scientific subject, but an artwork that’s not about a scientific subject. I think that if the artist is working with nature, then we should really consider the scientific context of the artwork. In a science museum, for example, a scientific artwork would be connected with specific biological cells or organisms. We shouldn’t be afraid to delve into the subject.

Even clothes and shoes alone can make a huge difference in the appearance of the body. The same shoes can change the look of an ordinary outfit if they are shiny and high-heeled.
When getting dressed or buying new clothes, we often do not think about the fact that clothes have a great impact on our health. Of course we may not have any thoughts about it at all, we are just thinking about looking nice, fashion trends and affordable prices.
Unfortunately, today most clothes are made from polyester, which is a plastic polymer and increases health problems. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, polyester clothing is classified as a by-product of oil drilling. Polyester is difficult to recycle and breaks down in the atmosphere, so its use in clothing is not that great. There is a better option to keep you healthy and comfortable – bamboo.
In recent years, scientists discovered that bamboo fabric is one of the most sustainable resources available and one of the first natural materials that need to be adapted for clothing and bedding. Bamboo fabric can be used in the production of everything we need – pants, dresses, T-shirts, bedding, socks, underwear. Bamboo clothing will provide the comfort of breathability that any other fiber does not have – this makes bamboo fabric a healthier choice for anyone who wants to avoid exposure to chemicals.
Bamboo fabrics are different from traditional fabrics. They have unique natural characteristics such as antibacterial properties, absorbency, comfortable warmth, UV resistance, and they are also temperature regulating. You can wear these clothes all year round. Bamboo fibers do not contain toxins such as pesticides, herbicides and petrochemicals. Natural bamboo clothing is much less likely to irritate sensitive skin than traditional clothing. Since bamboo fabric is soft and hypoallergenic, bamboo bedding feels very comfortable and provides a great night’s sleep.
Bamboo fiber is naturally non-allergenic and antibacterial. An article published by Current Pharmaceutical Design says that bamboo is capable of killing up to 99.9 percent of disease-causing microorganisms such as E. coli, staphylococcus aureus, mold and fungus.

Using the舞動奇迹 data table provided in the given prompt, perform a multiple linear regression analysis to predict a dancer's total score based on their age, gender, and fitness level. 

Once you have performed the regression analysis, interpret the results and discuss their implications for improving dance performance. Consider the implications of the findings for the design and implementation of dance training programs, as well as the broader topic of sports science in dance.

To perform a multiple linear regression analysis using the舞動奇迹 data table, we first need to import the data into a statistical software package such as R or SPSS. Once the data is loaded, we can use the regression function to determine the relationship between the predictor variables (age, gender, and fitness level) and the outcome variable (total score). 

In R, we can use the `lm()` function to perform linear regression. Here's an example code:

# load the舞動奇迹 data table into R
data <- read.csv(""舞動奇迹.csv"", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# perform multiple linear regression
model <- lm(total_score ~ age + gender + fitness_level, data = data)

# view the regression model summary
summary(model)

The `lm()` function specifies that we want to perform multiple regression, with `total_score` as the outcome variable and `age`, `gender`, and `fitness_level` as the predictor variables. The `data` argument specifies the data table we loaded earlier. 

The `summary()` function provides a summary of the regression model, including the coefficients for each predictor variable, the overall significance of the model, and the coefficient of determination (R^2) which describes the proportion of variance in the outcome variable that can be explained by the predictor variables. 

Interpreting the results of the regression analysis:

The regression coefficient for age indicates the change in total score associated with a one-unit increase in age, while controlling for the effects of gender and fitness level. A positive coefficient would indicate that older dancers tend to score higher on average, while a negative coefficient would indicate the opposite. If the coefficient is not significantly different from zero (i.e. the p-value is high), this suggests that age has little or no effect on dance performance.

The regression coefficient for gender indicates the change in total score associated with a one-unit change in gender, while",545,4,2689

In fact, good nutrition is key to all bodily systems, including the brain, respiratory, circulatory and nervous systems. Our bodies need a steady supply of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals from foods to provide energy for mental and physical activities. After all, what could be more important than feeling healthy and capable of getting through the day?
It’s only natural to feel anxious when starting a new diet. After all, your body’s health depends on getting proper nutrition. It’s essential to your physical health, and it’s equally important for a positive mental state.
One of the most common concerns with a diet change is what people will do with their cravings. You shouldn’t stop eating certain foods, so giving in to cravings is a sure path to failure. To avoid this, teach yourself some techniques for managing cravings before they control your eating. First, eat healthy foods at regular times. If you’re hungry, you shouldn’t wait until you’re starving to eat. When your blood sugar starts to drop, you become ravenous and want to eat everything you find. Second, maintain moderate portions. Most foods are best in moderation, and if you’re living on a restricted diet, portions can be especially tricky to manage. Eating a wholesome salad with less dressing may be less filling than filling up on chips and pop. And third, don’t turn to food for stress or upset. Everything from processed food to exercise can help with stress. Exercise releases endorphins, which make us happy, and foods that are high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids can reduce anxiety, improve mood, and improve overall well-being.
Before starting on any diet, make sure you seek professional advice and prepare all the options for a healthy diet, so you can choose according to your lifestyle, thus balancing your needs and your cravings. The Mediterranean diet is ideal for people who want to eat healthy and balanced foods but still enjoy a few of their favourite dishes. There are also many other healthy diet plans, such as the low carb/low glycemic plan, the blood type diet, the vegetarian diet, the raw food diet and the diet generated for people with hypothyroidism. Even if you are on a diet, it is always important to maintain good nutrition and its benefits to the whole body. If you do not have time to prepare meals or you just prefer eating out, make sure to carefully choose your meals and ask for the menu, in order to",540,4,2552

Personally, I have found myself on the front line as many of my friends have, trying to bring work to the table as production for ""The Gambler"" ended (although I enjoyed the film immensely). I have been attempting to promote writing, craft, and friendships through ""The Connection"" work and across social media with great success. I have reached out inquiring about editing jobs, writing jobs, casting, and crew positions on various film projects, as well as talking with as many people in the business as I can to catch up on recent films. Recently I've been talking to Mike Mohr about doing a podcast, but the project is still in the works and isn't yet official. In a very uncommon fashion, I've started to connect with some of the actors and crew members from ""The Gambler"" and writer/director Rupert Wainwright to produce a short film this summer. It's been a very interesting time, full of good networking and negative financial issues.
The good news is that I'll be changing my title and focus moving forward, as I will be taking a project manager/sales role in a new start up company for the film and television industries in Los Angeles this summer. This new role will be aiding, protecting, and presenting some wonderful films and television to the industry as well as becoming a consultancy for all things in the film/tv industry in the LA area. My focus will be to connect writers, directors, producers, actors, and crew with jobs, tips, info, and research material to aid their work from one of the many roles in production or advancement of film and television. I will also be connecting people from all walks of life within the industry with other people working within it.
My focus will still be on the craft. My writing and filming will still be a priority, but I will be offering this new and exciting role to a select group of individuals this summer to assist in progressing the film and television industries, including myself, in an exciting new way. I look forward to the future work I will be involved in, and I'd like to thank everyone that has supported me throughout this experience.

1521,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," tools and their evolution over time.
Cooking tools have evolved significantly over time, from basic Stone Age tools to advanced modern day kitchen appliances. The history of cooking tools can be divided into four main eras: prehistoric, protohistoric, classical, and contemporary.

Prehistoric Era: Cooking tools can be traced back to the early Stone Age, when stone knives, scrapers, and graters were used to prepare food. Hunting and gathering were the main forms of sustenance, and early cooking techniques included roasting, boiling, and smoking.

Protohistoric Era: In the protohistoric era, cooking tools evolved to include clay pots, iron knives, and bronze objects. Metal utensils made food preparation and cooking easier and more efficient, and utensils like frying pans and grills were introduced.

Classical Era: During the classical era, cooking techniques became more sophisticated, and culinary arts became more refined. Cooking methods like roasting, baking, and frying were widely used, and utensils like chopsticks and ladles were introduced.

Contemporary Era: The contemporary era has seen the invention of modern day cooking tools such as electric mixers, food processors, slow cookers, and microwaves. These inventions have revolutionized the way people cook, making food preparation and cooking faster and more convenient.

In conclusion, the history of cooking tools reflects the evolution of society and the human species. From basic Stone Age tools to advanced modern day kitchen appliances, cooking tools have evolved to meet the changing needs of humanity.

I find it interesting how much cooking tools have changed over time. What do you think will be the next big innovation in the cooking world?
I cannot predict the future. however, there are some developments in the field of cooking tools that are promising. for example, the trend towards sustainability and eco-friendliness is driving the development of reusable and biodegradable food packaging and utensils. additionally, advances in robotics and ai could potentially lead to the development of smart cooking appliances that can learn and adapt to individual preferences, leading to more personalized and convenient meal preparation.

I hope the next big innovation in cooking tools is something that makes cooking easier for people with disabilities. Do you think there will be any breakthroughs in this area?
I cannot predict the future, but there is already some work being done in this area. for example, there are some smart kitchen appliances that are designed to be easier to use for people with disabilities. for instance, some voice-activated smart appliances can be controlled using natural language, making it easier for people with physical",525,4,2740

We share 13 lessons to turn life into a one-sided day-trip of Utopia - so that your days become easier and more enjoyable.
We know that there are 24 hours in a day but the question is - how do we spend them, and do we get the best out of those 24 hours? Tired of a constant search for an understanding of your day in your memory? Let's see how you can use the power of brain to effectively learn from the past and bring new awareness and new success.
The global average attention span is 8 seconds, which is 1 second LESS than a goldfish. It's essential to bring your attention to the central point because while you aren't being focused, you fall out of the moment, and this is what you must forget about. Putting every ounce of attention that you have to train your brain to be conscious and focused while completing your daily tasks will have a huge impact on your productivity, energy, and happiness.
Neurons, neurons everywhere!
One of the most useful tricks that you can use to improve your motivation, energy, and productivity is to develop your mind's use of dopaminergic neurons. The mechanism makes you feel good by acting with 2 different dopamine receptors – the dopamine D1 and the dopamine D2. Each receptor has a different function, where the D1 receptor puts you in the 'go' mode, and the D2 receptor activates the 'stop' mode.
Scientists wanted to find out why people tend to procrastinate. When they tested different circumstances they noticed that there is a 20% chance that a person will procrastinate regardless of the task's complexity or ease. After reviewing the data, they concluded that, if a person is faced with a high level of uncertainty, they are more likely to procrastinate. The simplest way to deal with this uncertainty is to take on an incredibly simple task that is difficult to do.
Is your mind your treasure chest, or your storage room?

However, the pace at which change is occurring is increasingly rapid and most models predict this trend will continue for several hundred years. As such, it is important that urgent steps are taken to better understand these changes so we can take appropriate steps to manage their effects.
Whilst monitoring the climate system is typically a complex process, one of the main goals of modern climate science is to simplify this complexity and make predictions that will allow the identification of areas of potential change. By bringing together mathematical and statistical knowledge, we aim to highlight and identify new features of the climate system that can be tested through observation and use to improve climate models and the understanding of climate change.
Our group covers a wide range of topics from understanding the underlying physical processes and structures of the climate system to designing and evaluating methods to quantify environmental exposure. We use a wide range of tools and statistical methods including analytical theory, data analysis, statistical modelling, supercomputer simulations, data mining and machine learning.
We utilise the strengths of ENSO, we show that an earlier beginning of El Niño and a later cessation of La Niña are associated with higher tropical Pacific convection, weakening of the Walker circulation, reduced diabatic heating, and weakening or evaporation of the subtropical jet. Linking this to the global mean surface temperature, we find the observed ENSO characteristics in pre-industrial climate are associated with a lower global warming rate than projected by our coupled general circulation models without the El Niño pattern.

Ensemble forecasts rely on storm analysis in order to produce uncertainties. Unfortunately, only single sample ensemble analyses are possible for extreme storms with uncertainties related to initial analysis conditions. We used a brute force approach to analyse ensemble storm data from 2007 to 2012 for the North Atlantic region. This approach allowed us to compare how meteorological conditions in the atmosphere evolve and affect the storm development, since this evolution is where uncertainty in extreme storms might be found.

1529,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," goes back centuries. Over time, things have changed. Even though the practice of meditation, while still an ancient practice, has been replaced and interwoven in modern cultures. Today, meditation is a philosophy, tool, and practice. It’s easy to become distracted from trying to achieve that level of concentration, but this article will help you stay focused.
However, a lot of people get wrapped up in the fact that there are three different kinds of meditation and they don’t understand what all of the differences are. When you think of meditation, it’s usually one type that is the best option for you.
Have you ever thought that the type of meditation you practice is extremely important? It is. The truth is, meditation can be much more than breathing or focusing on a single object.
The issue with meditation is, many of us think we just sit down, become focused and everything is good to go. From experience, this is not the truth. Every person has different methods and techniques that can be more or less effective depending on their personality and mental health.
Today, we will be discussing the three most common meditation types. Here are the three meditation styles and what they involve.
This type of meditation involves different parts of your body. Some meditation types incorporate the physical movements of tai chi, yoga, or tai chi. This is a safe type of meditation and it’s not so out of reach for beginners.
This type is also known as insight meditation. This type of meditation is focusing on your thoughts and then understanding them on a deeper level. The Zen and Vipassana meditation falls in this category.
Mindfulness meditation is like most traditional types. However, the overall goal of mindfulness is to enhance awareness of thoughts and feelings in the moment.
For both types of mindfulness, you are making an effort to be constantly aware of your thoughts and feelings. While doing so, you need to not stop yourself from reacting to your thoughts and feelings.
When you experience feelings, you let them be and then you just let them go. This is not always easy to do, but it’s required. This type of meditation is extremely effective. However, you have to be diligent to keep practicing.

1530,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," cleansing is rudimentary knowledge; one part of it is that most pollutants are with us in trace or less amounts. Solutions for cleansing these pollutants are readily available and affordable. But it is the bigger aspect that if we indeed are suffering from ailments caused because of this pollution, then a more holistic approach and intervention in terms of lifestyle is required for the normalcy to be restored. After all the healing power of mother nature holds true and works wonders. Remedies from humble household materials are easier to source and are cheaper, as compared to those in pharmacy and other medical stores.
A study has found that 22 percent of ailments listed in the Ayurveda evidence based diet charts for the management of the disorders can be managed with remedies available in homes. Out of these, 15 percent are disorders classified as obesity, overweight and general physical health issues, while the remaining are chronic ailments. The solutions are simple, time-tested and affordable as they are primarily dietary changes, and other support remedies like steam baths and herbs as per the specific needs and individual life circumstances.
Dr Gopaldas Atreya, a renowned Ayurveda scholar and author of several books like the Ayurveda Evidence Based Diet Chart, stresses on the importance of personal accountability as well as trust on a good doctor. He says that in the face of the current health challenges faced by people, doctor-patient trust is pivotal and would open ways to more informed decisions by patients about their health. He further adds that diseases manifest due to a wrong lifestyle and diet habits. He credits medicinal herbs to the success of earlier civilizations, but demands introspection from people about their current lifestyle, that most are guilty of, and that leads to their health issues.
His theory that medication would heal an ailment, while overall lifestyle changes would be the prime cause of healing is very valid, as even if we were to rely on any anti-biotics, the dosage would reduce over a period of time, with the person in question. Hence, following right diet and lifestyle would be beneficial for one’s health. Atreya adds that Ayurveda is based on the belief that natural elements – the Five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space make up all living and non-living matter. His trust is on the natural process of our body, the flow of prana, nadis or energy channels, and the five senses as the main components of this belief. This belief is based on the practice of observing first, its effects and then moving forward with its value system.

Question: Why do people think certain paintings, sculptures, etc are so significant/meaningful/artistic?
People may think certain paintings, sculptures, etc are significant or meaningful/artistic because they express deeper, more abstract truths about human experience that cannot be captured in less expressive artworks or even words[3]. Art can also address larger cultural, social, political, economic and gender issues[5], and can be a way to feel less alone and to find new inspiration[5].

However, as lobbies for a tourism industry exclusively linked to the theme of nature mount worldwide, the key question is whether that market is as sustainable as it is said to be.
The fact that environmental questions are important to the extreme tourism industry – travel and tourism based on the essence of wild nature – should come as no surprise. On the other hand, it is increasingly clear that we are heading in the right direction: with a 70% increase in the last decade, extreme tourism is one of the fastest growing markets worldwide, according to industry experts. There is, however, a certain ambiguity in the image of this market, as there is in the notion of “landscape” that accompanies it.
The potential of nature conservation, for example, seems, to some, limited to a political or ideological reading. If we look closely, however, nature conservation is not only an ethical issue, but one of maintenance of an equally ethical system. Its justification is not very different from that of cultural conservation or tourism in industrial heritage cities.
From that perspective, tourism based on the exploration of landscapes has intrinsic value. It gives more meaning to the world by creating new connections among people and differentiating one’s experiences from those of others. In other words, it creates a narrative, which adds to people’s lives and strengthens the cultural fabric.
Extremes, extreme sports and adrenaline can mean different things to different people. It is a matter of interpretation and description that lies behind the term, for in order to convey this meaning the action should be described and placed in its appropriate context. In this way, our understanding of a cultural heritage tourist destination is framed within a continuum: some are more touristic than others, and their visibility, both in terms of accessibility and meaning for culture as a whole, depends on those defining factors.
The challenge for destinations and operators is to ensure that extreme sports and tourism, as a real market, become truly sustainable. The scale of promotion associated with these markets may seem to work like the “classic” tourist promotion system, but it differs mainly in the places it presents, the people who inhabit them, and those who develop the offer. By highlighting and promoting only one side of a destination, a tourism market is defined based on a market-size perspective. A true definition for a whole destination should not be based on a business module or media strategy, but rather on two fundamental criteria – identity and functionality.

This study of the Wilburton tephra sequence shows the exploration for oil/gas and uranium has limited understanding of the geology in the area of their activity. The Wilburton tephra was originally selected to identify the stepover zones in its area because it was a very distinctive and geochemically unusual tephra not only in this area but also globally. The sequence has been interpreted as tephra out of the Lesauve ash layer, which itself has also been interpreted as tephra of the end Cretaceous mass extinction, being trapped in fault structures and stratigraphic traps. Since discovery and subsequent activity in this area, the target source rock has proven to be very fluid dense, restricting productivity, and there has been virtually no production of uranium. This study aims to outline the provenance, documentation, geochemistry and palaeogeography of the Wilburton sequence. Variations in stratigraphy and chronostratigraphy provide interpretation of the tephra sequence in relation to the evolution of the western Allochthon. Great detail has been included about the geology and history of the discovery and exploitation of oil and uranium in the region and its neighbouring provinces. A unique methodology was developed to isolate and measure titanium dioxide. Matrix-clay separation techniques gave new insight into the elemental chemistry and atmospheric transport. The variations of geochemical, clastic and lithological characteristics of the Wilburton sequence and the regional tephra sequence were found to vary significantly, which imply the air-fall of greater amounts of tephra and increased ventilation of the process. Regional palaeogeography also lends itself to a great deal of geodynamic and/or atmospheric correlations and timelines.

We live in an age that is dominated by our emotions.
Sorrow, fear, anger, lack of patience and impatience have become our daily bread, never resting for a moment on our minds. How often do we feel dissatisfaction and lack of self-confidence? Our stress level increases gradually and our health conditions decline. Then we feel irritable, anxious, powerless, depressed or even experiencing insomnia.
We do not even know what emotional trouble is, so familiar are we with them.
In fact, we have been working with all these emotions since we are born.
We will always have to grow up, interact with others and establish relationships, work, earn money, get into fights with our partners and families, face challenges and find new plans and ideas. Our emotions never stop! They are a normal and constant part of human life.
Awareness of the everyday experience –We are very capable of seeing things in this life that make us happy, excited, proud and joyful. However, we cannot see much about our daily experience. When we ask ourselves about this area, it is always a good time to stop to think about it. You might be surprised by your findings. We rarely think about how we are dealing with emotions during the day.
With the training of the mind and by becoming aware of how emotions arise within us, we will get familiar with a very pleasant new experience. This can lead to a great balance, peace and better understanding in our lives.
The practice of mindfulness is the real key to our own heart.
The practice of mindfulness helps us keep our mind in this present moment and realize that awareness has the power to liberate us from many of the sufferings and tensions that we carry in ourselves and in our lives. The more we practice mindfulness, the more we will see the ways in which awareness can transform and heal.
We get the opportunity to engage in the moment.
We will learn to observe our thoughts and understand our daily conditions so that, with meditation, we can really arrive at the moment, to live the moment fully, with true awareness.

In the Middle Ages, after religious history had been disclosed, physics stood out as a field of human accomplishment. After the scientific revolution and especially during the 18th century, when Enlightenment values were applied to physics by Lavoisier, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and others, physicists gained not only a role in society but also the leadership of scientific endeavor.
Historically, physicists have continued to view themselves as leaders; before and since World War II, physics has provided a variety of role models for young people with intellectual capacities but a wide range of social attitudes. Whereas biology and chemistry often seem to carry the mark of limited responsibilities, physics presents an image of its practitioners, both in and out of the laboratory, that exudes the highest moral values. The scientist is a problem-solver who strives for exactness and wholeness, and it is in this respect that the physicist “takes his place” among the world's great scholars and heroes.

1542,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and technology have enabled us to reach such heights of perfection that are unimaginable. Consider the example of how sensors operate and how they operate in both normal and extreme conditions. Sensors are electronic devices, parts or subsystems designed to record and measure physical or mental phenomena, either in electronics or in mechanical engineering. There are several kinds of sensors available today. Some of them are listed below:
Proximity Sensor The proximity sensor is similar to a motion sensor which is normally placed on desks to detect the movement of an object. As you will have probably heard, motion sensors use infrared technology to detect a moving object in their field of vision. These infrared detectors come in handy in many industries, as they are able to detect objects that other types of sensors may miss. As you may imagine, a proximity sensor will not work at all if it is placed in the wrong location. In addition to this, they are also not able to see through walls and so cannot detect moving objects behind them. So, how does a proximity sensor work?
Infrared Sensors As mentioned above, a proximity sensor works by detecting infrared radiation. The way this is achieved is quite simple; a specific wavelength of light is focused on a target area. The light beam strikes the target and bounces off the surface. The amount of this reflected light that returns to the sensor is measured and can be used as an indication of the object being detected.
Infrared Light Sensors The other types of infrared light sensor we will be looking at here is the infrared light sensor. This can be used for all sorts of applications such as detecting heat, determining if there is any movement in a room and as a security sensor. It can also be used to detect objects in dark rooms.
Microphones Now, let's talk about another common type of sensor – the microphone. These can be connected to your home security system, mobile phone or even your computer. There are various types of microphones available such as broadband microphones, digital and analog microphones. They can be placed in the ceiling, walls or floors. The sound can be picked up from either the speaker or from an infrared transmitter.
Laser Light Sensors Another type of sensor that can be used in your home security system is the laser light sensor. This is similar to the infrared and it works by shining a laser into the target. The laser light is transmitted through a system of fibers and the amount of light that is emitted is measured and the sensor can detect this. The frequency of the laser light is used by the system to measure the intensity of the reflection",512,4,2659

Even in the Warhammer world where power armor, crossbows, and warhammers were once the norm, technological developments pushed forward super humans to become more like machines. And not just any machines, but advanced tech. Future tech that can implant nanite implants that can turn a normal human into a superhuman.
Though it all started with the giant White Dwarf promo, soon enough Warhammer 40,000 succumbed to the advanced tech pushed by the Tau. Even years later, their weapons and armor would incorporate cutting edge tech and be able to create plasma storms. But the Tau were still pretty evil (again… because it’s Warhammer). They murdered “The Inquisition,” I think, or a group of Cyborg Warriors, to get their hands on one of these super weapons to wipe out thousands of the noble Calth. It didn’t really matter.
By taking the technology of the Tau and combining it with the dangerous and deadly Primarchs to create the Primaris Astartes, (technically, Raven Guard Primaris, and Ultramarines Primaris), the Imperium recreated and improved on the power armor of the Tau. It worked. Now, the largest of Space Marine Chapters, every one that isn’t elite or Dark angel, had access to the nanite powered power armor of the Primaris Astartes.
Of course, before, the Ungrateful would be delighted to lay waste to a planet filled with those quaint little Tau.
Mind you, this much advanced tech would have the same affect on any Adeptus Astartes. I also realize this was released right before the Warhammer and 40k merged. Perhaps the Tau would have gotten along with modern warhams and sent the plasma deathbombs to join the Inquisition. Is that why they’re so important to Eldar culture and the Imperium?
And while it has been a while since I’ve read any Adeptus Mechanicus, I feel like this could be a much greater danger and not just because the TOB had them augment themselves into energy power armor much like the Tau had, even if it was not nearly as technically advanced.
Lambaren was a genius scientist. His power armor (Waaay late to the party here… As I did enjoy the ToB novellas) was meant as a more compact power armor than Titan, a step before building full sized Titan. Perhaps when he tried it out he said, “Phew!",516,4,2300

Astronomy is the study of objects in space and how they interact with one another. There are many different branches of astronomy, but the most well-known include planetary science, cosmology, and astrophysics. These fields use scientific methods to study the properties and behavior of celestial bodies, such as planets, stars, and galaxies.

One of the key areas of interest in astronomy is how stars form and evolve. This field is known as stellar astrophysics and involves studying the properties and behavior of individual stars, as well as the interactions between stars and their surrounding environments. Another important area of research is the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole, which is known as cosmology. This field involves studying the large-scale structures of the universe, such as galaxies, and the relationships between them.

Astrophysics is another important field in astronomy, which uses physics to study the properties and behavior of celestial bodies. This field involves studying topics such as the behavior of particles in space, the evolution of black holes, and the physics of the universe as a whole.

Overall, astronomy is a complex and fascinating field of study, and there are many different areas of research to explore. Whether you are interested in the properties and behavior of planets and stars, the evolution of the universe, or the physics of space, astronomy has something to offer.

Gardening is now a normal activity for people and can be pursued as an individual pastime or a group activity for a community. I’ve listed below just a few of the key benefits of gardening.
- Improves mood & physical health
- Social Interaction (develops friendships, family bonds, belonging, relationships, community)
- Forgets daily pressures (letting go of anxieties & worries)
- Helps people heal from depression and trauma
- Provides an endorphin hit from the physical exertion of working the soil
- Fosters an appreciation of nature (living creatures, land)
- Encourages reflection & self-awareness
- Develops self-confidence, self-esteem, self-identity
- Provides opportunities for creative expression
- Brings unity to community (meeting like-minded people, enjoying the together-time)
- Provides opportunities to learn new skills (demonstrations, workshops)
This list of benefits for gardening is endless and yet the key and most valued aspect for each individual is that which makes the personal impact. It provides a stimulating routine, a way to exercise and work, a way to combat boredom and time with others and friends, a way to produce a useful item, learn from different perspectives, heal wounds, develop confidence, acquire additional skills, assist those in need and involve the whole community. I could go on and on in fact but I will stop here. The point is that gardening gives people the chance to do what they want to do and not be bored, to feel good about themselves and to make a contribution to their community.

From barely intelligible articles to bleak headlines, don't let all of that stop you from diving into the ever-increasing complexity of this technology that may ultimately end up deciding if your machine will be able to successfully run on the same power grid that's powering it.
Artificial Intelligence is not an early adopter. It's not new or exciting to technology consumers, and it's been nearly impossible to understand and translate from gibberish, so it's mostly been given a pass and left for the experts.
Well, not so fast. Artificial Intelligence may have a few surprises in store for us all.
Think of the implications of AI in industry that doesn't have thousands of additional dollars in research and development for its next invention, in a 'hard to reach' corner of the world. Then realize that all of this could be happening in YOUR industry.
The US, unfortunately, is lagging in research and development in AI.
AI can't be confined to a wall to sit and write algorithms. That's not artificial intelligence. AI is an observation tool, a combination of hardware and software to understand information, and it does so by helping us predict human behavior. AI will actually decide, by observing our actions, how you'll act based on that observation.
That's a terrifying thought.
What if you go to the grocery store and the algorithm recognizes that your cart is empty and automatically runs the $100 personal shopping list to supplement and complete your cart? Or maybe you are a customer at a movie theater, and the algorithm recognizes your face and knows you want buttered popcorn (from your past purchase history)?
Who do you think would be controlling that information? The retailer? The AI?
Or what about the idea that maybe your employer could simply 'expect' you to go to work and their employees could use the truth of AI for their own benefit? Could they fire a citizen just by recognizing them?

The use of psychological interventions has become more commonplace in our social environment and in the workplace. Psychological interventions are increasingly becoming an integral part of our health system in helping to deal with the various issues that negatively affect the individual and society.
This course will explore the nature of psychological interventions and the effect they have on our daily lives, in terms of the impact on individual and society. You will learn about psychological therapies, counselling, cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) and other interventions.
The increased interest in psychological interventions has led to the increased use of psychologists in schools and other forms of healthcare and education. We will examine the effect of the psychosocial issues on healthcare and education, while also exploring how the involvement of psychologists may have an impact on community work and tackling gender-related issues.
This course is designed for students looking to establish careers in Psychology, Nursing or Social Work. It can also provide them with an understanding of the implications of the involvement of psychologists on healthcare, education and community work.

Antarctica is the Earth's coldest, driest and windiest continent, making it rather inhospitable to humans. Nonetheless, several countries have built up research stations and other bases for their people, and have conducted significant scientific research on the continent for decades. 

Question: Interesting facts about Antarctica
Antarctica is the Earth's coldest, driest, windiest continent[1][4][5]. It is the fifth-largest continent, covering more than twice the area of Australia[5]. It is a part of the planet and is the only continent that can lay claim to being uninhabited, as it lacks a permanent human population[5]. People have known about Antarctica since antiquity[2][5], and most people have never visited the continent[2][3][4][5]. Antarctica is governed by the 1961 Antarctic Treaty, which established Antarctica as a scientific preserve, prohibited military activity on the continent, and encouraged free scientific cooperation and exchange of information[3].",214,4,1006
1561,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," These can be material and spiritual.
Material
The significant contribution of dance to the development of the soul may have an effect on material life. In music, as we’ve seen before, the practical work of the mind in grasping a melody, and then bringing it to life so that people can relate to it, raises up the mind. This has the effect of increasing energy. Energy is composed of body, emotions and mind. Increasing energy from one of these levels is like trying to swim against a tide or pump water uphill. This difficult work raises the energy to the next level, so there’s a higher energy all round. This is what makes music so important, and not just the material energy that can then be used to help reach goals.
Material success
You might think that success in the material world is a more spiritual goal than dance. As we’ve seen in the definition of life in Chapter 28 (Life Is Not Material), there are only 3 basic, universal aims for life: to experience pleasure, to avoid pain and to seek happiness. When we have happiness, everything becomes easier. If something isn’t working in our life, it usually comes from a lack of happiness. If we have more energy for the mind and body, we can work through any obstacles.
The benefits of dance are not limited to the material; they’re felt deep within us. When we experience inner joy through music and movement, life seems simpler, more natural, more complete. Having this kind of energy helps when physical challenges come to us – we’re less affected.
We’re not saying dance is the only thing that does this, but it can certainly help.",337,4,1595

For example, for anyone looking for timely information on trends in computer science, the percentage of applications which cite the USA, the applicants or anything to do with the USA have seen a staggering decrease in the period 2004-2015 (see chart below). In contrast, citations to L.A.S.A.M. (Leser-Anfangsdepositions Speicherprogramm), give a huge increase over the same time period. Clearly the pharmaceutical world does not take computer science seriously. Presumably this reflects the fact that programs written in C++ don't work, or stop, at the first unexpected exception. Compare and contrast to the situation in law, where people are willing to spend four years of painful study and vast amounts of money for a theoretical understanding of a dubious subject which is presumably going to protect them from real-life lawsuits.
Amazingly, the patent applications registry also has data on the world of Swiss bank accounts and how they are organised. See chart above.

""We know by looking at the triangle that the Nth number is the sum of the Nth and N+1th odd numbers. Then you start drawing the triangle and it starts to look like a fractal. It looks like a smiley face.""
When those numbers began percolating through the organization, O'Reilly says, it got scientists talking about numbers that are even more complicated -- numbers known as ""typical numbers,"" where the probability of various numbers are given by their place in the triangle (much like a probability study in gambling). In fact, he says, the 2012 paper in Nature established a link between typical numbers, the Fibonacci numbers and the Sierpinski Triangle, a popular math-inspired design. From that study, in 2014 researchers published a paper demonstrating how the numbers grew and examined properties of ""typical numbers"" for example: the speed of convergence to a typical number as the numbers N got larger",519,4,2476

Additionally, examine the influence of major literary movements, such as Romanticism, Modernism, and Postmodernism, on the genre. Provide examples of different poetic forms, including sonnets, haikus, villanelles, and free verse, and explore how they reflect the changing attitudes and themes in poetry over time.

Poetry has been an integral part of human culture since ancient times, and its evolution reflects the changing cultural, social, and intellectual contexts of different eras. In this essay, I will provide a comprehensive overview of the development of poetry from ancient times to the present, highlighting the key figures, significant works, and cultural contexts that shaped its evolution.

The earliest form of poetry was oral poetry, which was passed down through generations through storytelling and song. The Rig Veda, an ancient Indian text composed around 1500 BCE, is considered to be one of the earliest examples of oral poetry. In ancient Greece, poets like Homer and Hesiod composed epic poems such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, which were highly regarded for their narrative and poetic artistry.

In the Middle Ages, European poetry took a more religious and devotional tone, with the Latin poetry of the Church dominating the literary scene. However, during the Renaissance period (15th-17th centuries), poetry became increasingly secular and individualistic, with poets like John Donne, John Milton, and William Shakespeare composing works that explored themes of love, morality, and human nature. The sonnet, a 14-line form of poetry that originated in Italy in the 13th century, became a popular form of English poetry during this period.

In the 18th century, British Romanticism emerged as a major literary movement, with poets like William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge prioritizing the natural world and the expression of intense emotions in their poetry. The Gothic and Haiku styles of poetry also emerged during this period, with poets like Edgar Allan Poe and Matsuo Basho using surrealism and restraint, respectively, in their works.

In the 19th century, Poetry had different variations of theme and style. The American Transcendentalism movement led by writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman emphasized individuality, spontaneity,",488,4,2567

For example, in children’s weather shows, it is often recommended that the storyteller includes human characters who will cause a storm, rain, snow or thunder and lightening in some way. The other weather elements such as winds, hail, sleet or fog, can be included to make the story all the more interesting. At this stage, the only thing which matters is that the children can visualise the storm and relate to it very easily. This way, they will remember the show very clearly, and the information they gain will be something which will stay with them for a lifetime.
If you are the Meteorologist who is talking in the children’s show, it is important to always be in front of the audience. Stand up straight, talk from the front and be animated in your actions and gestures. Using stories to deliver your message in a very compelling way is the most important thing for you to remember.
Bending over to talk to the audience is not going to help your cause. For those children who are too far away, you can raise your voice slightly and speak more loudly. This kind of effective communication is the key to your talk being successful. When you are making a presentation for a school’s event, it is important to practice delivering a few times before you actually go out there.

Once upon a time, there was a company that specialized in data analytics and machine learning. They worked with large corporations to analyze their data and provide insights that could help improve their operations and increase profits.

One of their most valuable customers was a major retail chain that had a huge amount of sales data, but no real way to make sense of it. The retail chain was struggling to optimize their inventory, prevent stockouts, and improve their sales.

The analytics company worked with the retail chain to develop a machine learning algorithm that could analyze their sales data in real-time and provide personalized recommendations to store managers. The algorithm took into account factors such as weather, trends, and special promotions to suggest the best products to stock in each store.

At first, some store managers were skeptical of the algorithm, but after seeing the results, they became true believers. The algorithm was able to predict which products would sell out before they even arrived in the store, allowing the retail chain to adjust their inventory accordingly.

As the retail chain continued to use the algorithm, they saw a significant improvement in their sales and profitability. Customers were happier because they always found what they were looking for in stock, and the retail chain was able to reduce waste and save money on storage and shipping costs.

The analytics company continued to work with the retail chain to improve their data analytics and machine learning capabilities, helping them stay ahead of their competitors and continue to grow their business.

And so, the analytics company and the retail chain became long-term partners, using machine learning and data analytics to transform the retail industry and help businesses of all types succeed.

What programming languages are commonly used for machine learning?
There are several programming languages commonly used for machine learning, including:

1. Python: Python is the most popular language for machine learning, due to its simplicity, readability, and vast collection of libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, and pandas.

2. R: R is another popular language for machine learning, particularly in statistics and data analysis. It has several libraries such as caret, randomForest, and glmnet, which provide a wide range of machine learning algorithms.

3. Java: Java is used extensively in the development of enterprise-level machine learning systems. Java frameworks such as Weka, Deeplearning4j, and Apache Mahout provide powerful tools for machine learning.

Because some natural phenomena associated with medicine are inorganic, such as thirst, some are diseases or disorders of the body, such as fever, and others are both inorganic and associated with disease, such as anesthesia, medicine was associated with inorganic or ""nature"" (Non-Living) and thus people concluded medicine could not be created.

Meteorology, which is the study of the atmosphere, has played a crucial role in the development of technology. In fact, many of the tools and devices used in meteorology were first developed for other purposes before being adapted for use in weather observation and forecasting.

One of the earliest examples of technology developed for meteorological purposes is the barometer, which was originally used to measure the pressure of the air. In the 17th century, Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli invented the barometer, which allowed for the first time a precise measurement of atmospheric pressure. This discovery paved the way for the development of many other instruments that were used to measure weather conditions, such as the anemometer, which measures wind speed and direction, and the hygrometer, which measures humidity.

As technology has advanced, so too have our abilities to predict and prepare for extreme weather events. For example, radar technology was developed during World War II for military purposes, but has since been adapted to aid in weather forecasting. Radar can detect and track storms, allowing meteorologists to forecast their movements and intensity. Satellites also play a crucial role in weather forecasting, allowing meteorologists to see conditions around the world and providing more detailed information about weather patterns.

In addition to the development of specific tools and devices, technology has also helped to advance our overall understanding of meteorology. For example, the development of computers has allowed for the analysis of large amounts of data and the creation of more accurate weather models. This technology has been essential in predicting the development of severe weather events, such as hurricanes, and in preparing for their impact on communities.

However, there are also concerns that technology can sometimes lead to a lack of human oversight in meteorology, potentially causing inaccurate or biased predictions. Additionally, technology can be expensive and not accessible to all communities, meaning that there are still significant disparities in weather forecasting and preparedness between different regions of the world.

In conclusion, the relationship between meteorology and technology is complex and multi-faceted. While technology has played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the world and our ability to predict natural disasters and other extreme weather events, it is important to also consider the potential drawbacks of relying too heavily on technology and the importance of having human oversight in meteorology.

However, the introduction of robotics and automation in a variety of fields has been the norm for years now. In fact, the most common use of robotics and automation around the world is still in manufacturing and supply chain automation.
This is where the most common fears about robotics and automation actually hold true; robotics and automation don’t just take jobs, they replace them entirely. Someone using one of the most advanced industrial robotics will do the job a human would do in a short fraction of the time it would take.
However, with time, most of these jobs become obsolete; robots will replace humans in performing these laborious tasks and as the technology gets more advanced, robots will be able to do tasks faster than humans, which is not sustainable over a prolonged period of time.
When robotics and automation became the norm, it changed the economy; humans are still needed to do the stuff they were doing before, but the demand has been significantly lessened for the job itself.
Most of the time, robotics and automation have been slower to reach the service sector, mostly because of the lack of efficiency and consistency in providing service.
Providing service is a task that requires detailed, precise attention to detail, which is rarely a strong point for most robots. To meet the needs of clients, staff in the service sector have been dedicated to meeting and exceeding client needs, which is something that a robot is still relatively incapable of doing on its own.
This is not to say that robotics and automation in the service sector are not being used; it’s just that in many cases, human resources are still necessary. Some examples of where robotics and automation are used extensively in the service sector include dealing with environmental hazards, garbage collection, and even traffic monitoring.
The rise of robotics and automation in retail also means more and more people are losing their jobs, especially in jobs that can be done mostly by machines. However, for the most part, the field of retail is not something you can automate from the bottom up, which makes you question whether or not it can be fully automated.
One of the main problems with robotics and automation when it comes to retail is logistics. Finding the right place to place products has become much easier with the advent of AI, but it’s still not the same as having human staff who can store and organize products efficiently.

This has led to the creation of new industries and has boosted the global economy.

Moreover, space exploration has inspired future generations to pursue careers in science and technology. The exploration of space has shown us the vastness of the universe and the importance of scientific discovery. Children look up to astronauts as role models, and the same goes for engineers and scientists who are working towards making space exploration a reality.

Furthermore, space exploration has facilitated international cooperation and diplomacy. Projects such as the International Space Station and the Mars missions have brought together scientists and engineers from various countries. This has led to increased understanding and cooperation between nations, breaking down barriers and promoting global unity.

Lastly, space exploration has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems. For instance, by studying the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body, scientists can develop ways to prevent aging and diseases. Additionally, the materials and technology developed during space missions can be applied to other industries, such as medicine and energy production.

In conclusion, space exploration is a crucial field that has led to significant advancements in science, technology, and global cooperation. Its impact extends beyond our immediate reality, providing solutions to some of the world's most pressing issues.

Highlights of the conversation:
Nana Ama means ""Mother"" in Fante. She is the founder and curator at www.eclecticeyeglasses.com. A 40-year old a mother of two children, from Cape Coast, in the Central Region of Ghana. She was born a fifth child to her parents, both of whom worked for the Armed Forces. She hails from a tight knit family which has now dwindled with the passing on of her parents. Nana Ama had a very spirited childhood, full of love and care. Her father, Dr. Evans Ake Victor Kumi who was a Doctor with the Naval Medical Services and her mother, Cetae Naa, a nurse had instilled in her values and principles that still shape and guide her lifestyle.
While she was in the campus, she worked at Top Ladies Magazine and had a stint with her first marketing job as an Assistant Brand Manager, having been the marketing intern at Baby Dr. and as the marketing manager for Amyumi Foods limited. She had always been a curious person and started her online platform a decade ago, that came first in a domain name as allwomen.com – she has since ventured into various niches over the years. She has a big dream of becoming a teacher, and to create many more channels to document not only the lives of women but that of men and the younger generation.

1581,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are changing our perceptions of the solar system. By refining our image of our star, new information can be gleaned about how the Earth and Moon moved through space. Just a few years ago, the Solar System’s temperatures changed dramatically as we mapped the so-called “plasma nebula.” Now we find that dust grain radar has also illuminated portions of the dust cloud where the “Big Bang” began.
Dust grains and other particles in space formed the matter that eventually led to the formation of Earth’s Moon and planets, according to researchers at University of Michigan, New Mexico State University and NASA.
“The moon and planets formed as the result of a massive cloud of gas and dust that made up the very early solar system,” said Bob Johnson, a planetary scientist at NMSU and professor of physics. “Our study shows that such a cloud is composed of billions of tiny, solid pieces of dust, forming concentric rings within concentric rings around the central star. Each ring was forged from dust taken from different parts of the central disk.”
The findings appear in the online issue of Science Express, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
The study shows that dust grains play a key role in forming the solids that eventually became the building blocks of planets. When huge clumps of dust formed in the “proto-planetary disk,” the gravitational pulls of larger rocks in the center caused them to congregate into ever larger objects. Over time, these objects grew into increasingly massive planets, eventually forming the solar system we live in.

“This work has a very direct implication to the origin of planets and the building of the solar system,” Johnson added. “It helps us understand the details of how planets form around the central star.”",375,4,1855

Mathematics is a major branch of science that involves the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns. Here are some interesting facts about mathematics:

1. The word ""mathematics"" comes from the Greek word ""máthēma,"" which means ""that which is learned"" or ""that which is studied.""

2. The ancient Greeks are widely credited with the development of advanced mathematics, including geometry, algebra, and calculus.

3. Euclid's Elements, written in 300 BC, is considered the most influential mathematical treatise of all time. It was a comprehensive guide to geometry and included 13 books on topics such as points, lines, angles, and circles.

4. Albert Einstein was a brilliant mathematician and physicist, and he once said, ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.""

5. The mathematical constant pi (π) is a fundamental number in mathematics. It is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter and is approximately equal to 3.14159.

6. The Fibonacci sequence, named after Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It begins with 0 and 1, and the next number is always the sum of the two preceding ones. This sequence appears in many natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the branching of trees, and the spiral patterns found in shells and hurricanes.

7. The ancient Egyptians were known to use a system of hieroglyphics that included mathematical symbols. They were able to solve quadratic equations and divide numbers up to 64,000.

8. The Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, has been used for centuries to calculate distances and build structures.

9. The world's first computer, the Abacus, was created by the Chinese around 400 BC. It was a simple tool that used beads on a board to perform arithmetic operations.

10. The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical concept that was first developed in the 1970s. It is a set of complex numbers that are used to create a visual representation of chaos theory. The Mandelbrot set has a complex and beautiful shape that has fascinated mathematicians and scientists for decades.

As the early 19th century rolled around, the United States was on the brink of monumental discovery in the field of neuroscience. John Morgan, an American physician and neuroscientist, had a vision of studying the nervous system and its functions.

In the 1850s, Morgan and his colleagues created a network of clinics, hospitals, and research centers across the country, pioneering new treatments for diseases like epilepsy and paralysis.

But their work would soon be shadowed by the mind-boggling discoveries of Sigmund Freud, who brought psychoanalysis to the fore. The idea of the unconscious mind and its role in mental health took hold, prompting Morgan and his peers to explore the uncharted territory of the brain.

With the emergence of electrical stimulators in the early 20th century, researchers such as Walter Heitler began to delve deep into the intricacies of the nervous system. Heitler's work on the spinal cord led to new discoveries in spinal injury treatment.

By the 1950s and 60s, the focus shifted to the chemical pathways of the brain, thanks to pioneering work by Marie-Claire Jouin. Her research on neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin led to new treatments for depression and other psychiatric disorders.

The late 20th century brought a new era of understanding about the brain's plasticity and its ability to rewire itself. Researchers like Eric Kandel and Michael Merzenich explored the neural basis of memory, learning, and language.

As the 21st century dawned, scientists in the United States were poised to make even greater breakthroughs in understanding the brain's structure and function. And with it, hope for better treatments and cures for neurodegenerative diseases, autism, and more.

In just a century and a half, neuroscience has come from the early days of piecemeal observations and treatments to a highly sophisticated and interconnected science, driven by discovery after discovery that has broadened our understanding of the human brain and its vital role in human life.

Wow, it's amazing how much progress has been made in neuroscience in the United States. What are some current areas of research in this field?

There are several current areas of research in neuroscience in the United States, some of which include:

1. Brain-machine interfaces: This area involves using technology to enhance the connection between the brain and machines. This could include using brain signals to control prosthetic limbs or communication devices.

The first part of this module examines in detail the contrasting characteristics of the modern macroeconomy. To this end, the market structure of a number of industries are analysed, including the financial sector, manufacturing and retail. The determinants of GDP growth are considered and explained, both historically and internationally.
These are political, social and technical changes that occur in the context of globalisation. Topics include technological change, democracy and capitalism, the public sector and institutions, and economic growth.
Critically analyse the performance of the macroeconomy in order to forecast growth and supply sides shocks that will impact on GDP, trade and investment.
This module is very good. Although the first two weeks did seem to be preparing us for the actual content (although some areas related), we really get into the nuts and bolts of understanding the economy, both in the UK and elsewhere. However, as with any subject module, it is a lot of content, but you start to realise the benefit of studying this subject, rather than just being taught in this module!
The module brief in week 2 is better than week 1. This is because week 1 taught the module requirements, but didn’t teach the students anything. So in week 2 the content is better explained, and allows for further learning. If you read the other students’ module reviews, this appears to be the same structure. This is great. Because in week 1 we spent a long time learning, in the second week, we know the content.

The first two days were spent at the International Centre of Cite des Arts Mette in the historic quarter of the city, while the last two days was at the Théâtre Gheza at the University of Pau.
During these four days, the students participated in four workshops called “Professionals of Arts in Architecture”, in which cinema, architecture and pedagogy experts from the Basque Country interacted and a dialogue with the student teams of architects, visual artists, cinematographers and theatre directors gave rise to interesting new approaches in the world of arts.

Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Emily who struggled with anxiety. She would often feel overwhelmed and stressed out, and it began to affect her daily life. Emily tried different coping mechanisms like exercise, meditation, and therapy, but nothing seemed to work. She felt like she was stuck in a cycle of anxiety that she couldn't break out of.

One day, Emily's therapist suggested that she look into the field of psychology. Emily didn't know much about psychology, but she was curious and open-minded. She started researching different theories and techniques related to anxiety and mental health, and she began to see a connection between her daily life and the concepts she was learning.

As she learned more, Emily realized that psychology wasn't just a topic studied by psychologists or doctors. It was something that everyone could benefit from in their daily lives. Emily started to apply what she learned to her own life, and she saw positive results almost immediately.

She started small, like taking a deep breath before a stressful situation and telling herself to stay calm. She also began to take mental health days when she felt overwhelmed, instead of pushing through her anxiety. Over time, Emily started to feel more in control of her anxiety, and she was able to manage it much more effectively.

Emily realized that psychology was much more than just the theories and techniques she had learned about. It was a way of thinking about herself and the world around her that had the potential to transform her life. Emily became more confident and motivated, and she began to see the world through a new lens. She realized that taking care of her mental health was just as important as taking care of her physical health.

From that day on, Emily saw psychology as a tool that she could use to improve her everyday life. She knew that it would be a journey, but she was excited to see where it would take her. Emily's experience with psychology not only changed her life but also inspired others to seek out the benefits of this important field. And so, Emily continued to learn and grow, knowing that she was never alone in her struggles or her journey towards mental wellness.

A key issue is the possibility of genetic modification -- GM (or similar manipulations). In addition to the scientific safety of any given product or process, you have to consider the social and cultural issues raised. Earlier this week Dr. Jeffrey Cook, a psychologist who used to have a regular column in my Nutrition Alert, blogged on the issue of labeling of foods as non-GM:
Labels Can Help Consumers Avoid Unhealthy Foods (Psychology Today)
If you are a psychologist like me, food labels are fascinating. Reading labels is one of the few occasions when you are forced to explore your moral intuitions – are GMO foods acceptable or not? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) generally allow GMO foods if they are as safe to eat as their conventionally produced counterparts. There is, however, some disagreement over this, with an increasingly vocal group of consumers expressing serious doubts.
I don't normally read psychology research papers, and I was intrigued by the Title: Who is the Best “Intuitive Ethicist”? Exploring whether or not GMO foods can cause harm a “slippery-slope”.
Ethics is tricky. Every experience, every example and every situation can reveal ambiguity and even contradiction. What's more, they raise the question: is any argument or conclusion to be trusted? Gut feel is only one of the evidence bases that should be considered.
Labels are frequently imposed not only by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, but also by food manufacturers themselves. Their motives are probably financial, but the labelling can raise an issue about the meaning of food. What does ""fat-free"" really mean? If a product contains only fat and no calories, would it still be described as ""fat-free""? Scientists in Malaysia have explored the notion of fat-free beer (Progress in Health Sciences, 1(1): 29-34).
Following the development of low fat versions of ice cream and cheese, Michael Pollan suggested that the term ""fat-free"" was not appropriate (The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, ISBN 978-0-393-06780-0, p. 254).

Theater can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where religious and political ceremonies were performed as part of public entertainment. In Greece, theater began in the 6th century BC as part of religious festivals, such as the Dionysia festival, which celebrated the god of wine and fertility. Greek theater is still celebrated today, with some of its most famous works, such as ""Aristophanes"" ""Lysistrata,"" ""Medea,"" and ""The Frogs.""

In Rome, theater was an essential part of the city's culture, and the emperors were often involved in its production. During this time, theaters could seat up to 15,000 people and were considered a status symbol for wealthy patrons. Roman theater reached its peak during the 1st century BC, and it was during this time that some of the greatest playwrights emerged, such as Seneca and Plautus.

During the Middle Ages, theater was often suppressed or outlawed because of its association with pagan beliefs. However, the Black Death led to an increase in theatrical performances as people sought to escape their hardships and grief. These performances were often performed in public spaces, such as churches, and were typically religious or pastoral in nature.

In the Renaissance, theater experienced a revival, and the public theater was established. The English playwright William Shakespeare is widely considered the greatest playwright of the Renaissance period, and his works, such as ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Macbeth,"" and ""Hamlet,"" are still performed today.

In the 19th century, theater became more focused on realism, and there was an increased emphasis on exploring the social and psychological realities of life. This period saw the emergence of important playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen, who challenged traditional ideas of morality and social norms.

In the 20th century, theater became more diverse, and there was an increased emphasis on diversity and representation. There were also technological advances, such as sound and lighting, that changed the way theater was produced. Contemporary theater is more experimental and inclusive, and it continues to explore a wide range of themes and issues. Today, theater remains a vital art form, and it continues to evolve and adapt to new audiences and audiences' changing expectations.

5. Autonomous vehicles: Machine learning algorithms are used to enable self-driving cars to navigate safely and make decisions in real-time. It is expected that the deployment of autonomous vehicles will significantly improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, and increase mobility for people who are unable to drive.

In conclusion, machine learning is a crucial tool in modern society that has the potential to revolutionize various industries. Its ability to extract insights from data, automate decision-making processes, and improve efficiency is making it an essential part of our daily lives.

Can you explain how machine learning is used in natural language processing? Machine learning is a key component of natural language processing (NLP), which is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and understand human language.

Here are some ways in which machine learning is used in NLP:

1. Sentiment analysis: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the sentiment of a text, i.e., whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

2. Speech recognition: Machine learning algorithms can be used to recognize and transcribe human speech into text. This technology is used in voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa, as well as in language translation apps.

3. Language translation: Machine learning algorithms can be used to translate one language into another. These algorithms learn from large datasets of translated texts to improve their accuracy",528,4,3057

Using the powerful ideas of Albert Einstein and others, we investigate the structure of space, time, and matter, and see how these structures are the basic conditions for all physical reality.
Topics include the nature of energy and why matter is material. We’ll also look at some of the most important discoveries of modern science: the special theory of relativity, which revolutionized our view of the universe; the Pauli exclusion principle; superconductivity; and the concept of tunneling. There are also two “how do you know that?” questions that this course addresses that are especially relevant to students of history and philosophy: How can we know about the universe if the instruments we use to study it may themselves be limited in their ability to reveal the truth? And second, why should we trust in objective truth when we know that our own sensory organs may deceive us?
One of the beauties of quantum mechanics is that many different models of our universe have been proposed over the years, all equally valid, in their own domains of applicability. This course shows how to build and use many of these models. In doing so, students explore the role of mathematics in physics and some of the key concepts that are central to modern physics, such as light, mass, momentum, angular momentum, electric charge, and quantum numbers.
The sheer beauty of modern physics will be an inspiration and a delight for everyone.
Students in this course learn how to think like scientists. They explore the unification of forces and the underlying principles of mathematics that are applicable to nature. Students will also discuss the very big questions in physics and what the future of physics might bring: what’s next for all the “fundamental” fundamental particles, what are the links between quantum mechanics and classical physics, what about exotic but as-yet unobserved particles and forces, and, ultimately, what is the nature of reality?

It is shown, in fact, that the most brilliant inventors of literature did not succeed in carrying out their dream of radically changing the mechanisms of education. However, in considering that the 'word' still connotes the house, it is possible to identify in the family the best possible environment for a 'middle school' to emerge. It is shown that what really changes is the relationship between the parents, the school and the child who is educated to join the new middle school that forms. The study of the school child-who also, incidentally, is a student- is then considered, first, in relation to the moment in which he turns from being, in the Latin, a minor to being a major (despite the fact that the absence of legal capacity is still due to age), and then in relation to the definitive passage from the formal school to the everyday world of the working life. It is shown that the contemporary adult reflects on the relationship between he himself and his childhood. What is studied in the second section is the comparison between alienation and adaptation of the middle school in the study of literature. The forms of alienation considered in connection with the work of two great Mexican, authors are not in opposition: Octavio Paz, as a result of alienation, discovers on his own the 'dumb image' of literature; Juan Rulfo can write about this image of the house, as a citizen who is repatriated, without being unable to free himself of it. In the case of Rulfo, it is shown how the house of the writer is recollected in the project of a nation that resists dictatorship, the family of the citizen in his tie with the peasants. The analysis of literature, which concludes this section, is based on Vicente Rojo's novel Temlacayan. As a result of his dealings with the language of his father, who appears to him as an alien 'human being,' the central character of Rojo's novel, also called Temlacayan, he learns to express himself in the native language. His cultivation of the language is a task of adapting himself to a country that suffers the effects of domination: he, in effect, contributes to recovering the identity of an ethnicity lost in the occupation of the land.",494,4,2351
1600,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," photography is one of the topics I regularly write about here at Read my Thoughts. When I look back over the years, the words and thoughts are very easy to find, as it is always an enjoyable topic.
As our world changes with the new technology and the many new applications for imagery we are presented with, one of the major discussions is regarding digital versus film. My stance has always been to use the best of the two existing technologies to the best of your ability and that you will always be left with amazing images. When I talk with many photographers from many different areas of work, it seems that there is one common theme. If there is an image that demands to be printed, they know that a photograph taken with film is always the best choice. For the most part the digital photographs will not “glow” and hold that powerful subject matter that prints from film do.
Just like with film and any other mediums, you must use them to the best of your ability, and with the right amount of skills. With digital photography, it is so easy to say we can leave the room and come back and take more photos because you may have missed the perfect moment. When you are using film, this is not the case as it really pays to use every piece of film you have. When you plan a shoot or photo project you must know what you are looking for and at which locations. You should be very focused on the shot, and learn to work with your subject and composition very well, this will save you much time in the end.
With film, one needs to know the limitations of what their camera and film are able to achieve, it is wise to find a lens that will work very well with both. Film in general, must be handled with care; it is also expensive. There are still many great camera companies that specialize in film cameras and with a new search engine it should become quite easy to find the camera you want. Photographers who are working very hard at studying and practicing their craft every day will not let anything interfere with the chances of getting the shot.
I have a collection of cameras, 8 mm, 35 mm, large format, Polaroid and disposable cameras. This gives me many options when I am out on a shoot. There is something magical about the magic boxes that I just love using.

These two classes contain stars which are so different, they provide examples for the different evolutionary stages the Universe passes through as it ages. The life cycles of stars lead to star explosions, some of which remain unchanged for millions of years after they occur, while others leave behind traces of their birth, which are much more dramatic. We finish the week discussing the largest stars in the Universe, which has been around for 13 billion years, and yet the longest time we can observe any star is a mere 11 billion years.

A lot of times on Saturday morning we end up swapping gardening tips as we drink coffee at the table in the early hours, while the family snores upstairs. Today we were discussing slug pellets and choosing the right materials for them – who would of thought that such a mundane topic would inspire such lively discussion?
This week we’ve been working on several patient gardens. The practice has agreed to put in money to set them up and the patients pitch in the rest.
One lady has in mind that perhaps the children who have a lock on their 12 year old bikes next to the nursery will be able to reach and enjoy the apple tree outside her window.
We saw all sorts of things growing in patients gardens, from rowan fruit to raspberries to rhubarb. Tom had also recently cut down a laurel that was overgrowing and encroaching on the practice.
We have really started looking at our surroundings with fresh eyes. Being able to work outside, to be around plants and nurture them, keeps you grounded and is so therapeutic.

1604,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and how it has evolved over time.
The history of medicine can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, and China. Ancient Egyptian physicians believed in the ""Four Humors Theory,"" which stated that illnesses were caused by an imbalance of four bodily fluids (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile). They used various methods such as prayer, incantations, and rituals to cure illnesses.

In ancient Greece, Hippocrates introduced the idea of ""do no harm,"" which became a fundamental principle of modern medicine. Galen, a renowned physician of the time, made significant advances in the field by developing treatments for various illnesses.

During the Middle Ages, medicine was heavily influenced by religious beliefs and practices. In medieval Europe, hospitals were established and medicine was practiced by Christian monks. Medicine was also developed by Jewish scholars, who contributed significantly to the fields of anatomy, pharmacology, and microbiology.

The Renaissance saw a significant change in medicine, with more emphasis on empirical research and experimentation. Leonardo da Vinci made advances in anatomy, while Andreas Vesalius published a groundbreaking book on human anatomy.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw significant advancements in medicine with the development of immunization, bacteriology, and microbiology. The discovery of germs and the use of antiseptics revolutionized the field of medicine, and significant developments in surgery and anesthesia were made.

In the 20th century, advances in medical technology and pharmaceuticals transformed the field of medicine. The discovery of antibiotics and vaccines dramatically reduced the incidence of diseases. The invention of X-rays, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revolutionized diagnosis and treatment.

Today, medicine continues to evolve, with advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. The development of personalized medicine and precision medicine promises to revolutionize the field of medicine even further in the future.

That was very interesting! Can you tell me more about the role of women in medicine throughout history?
Sure, women have played a significant role in medicine throughout history. In ancient times, women were traditionally the primary caregivers, and some of the earliest known medical practitioners were women.

In the Middle Ages, women were not allowed to practice medicine, and men dominated the field. However, there were some exceptions, such as Sorcha of Sligo in Ireland and Merit-Ptah in ancient Egypt, who were both noted physicians in their respective societies.

During the Renaissance, some women became physicians and surgeons, although it was still a very rare occurrence. Joan",519,4,2773

There are many theories within the field of sociology, but you don’t need to understand them all in order to understand the basics. Instead, you need to understand the fundamentals of social stratification and inequality.
Social stratification refers to a hierarchy of social groups, where individuals are ranked according to their status and power. In many societies, this can be based on wealth, occupation, education, or another characteristic. In sociology, this is known as social class.
Inequality is another important concept in sociology. Inequality refers to differences in wealth, power, and other resources between groups of people. This can result in feelings of anger, resentment, or anger towards those in power. In sociology, inequality is often referred to as social stratification.
Inequality can also be based on race or gender. This is because people with different ethnicities and genders have different opportunities and privileges.
Wealth is another important factor in understanding social dynamics. Wealth refers to the amount of money and assets that an individual or organization has. It can be based on income, investments, real estate, or other factors.
In general, the more wealth an individual or group has, the more power and influence they have.
Additionally, wealth can affect social mobility. If a person or group is wealthy, they are likely to have more opportunities and resources than people who are not wealthy.

In order to truly enjoy your upcoming meditation practice, you first need to understand why you’re doing it.
Many of us get confused about the terms, beginning to think that meditation is a spiritual practice and not a mental process. “Meditation is not the thing. The thing is the mind. If the mind is quiet, the result is going to be meditation,” says Yehudi Cohen, Ph.D., an Oakland meditation teacher who teaches Introduction to Meditation, Mindfulness, and Early Tantra. There is a spiritual aspect to this process, but we shouldn’t rely on it, he says. “Reliance on all kinds of physical and spiritual experience is easily called delusional. Meditation, if it is real, is silence and nothing else. And if it has any kind of experience in it, it’s bad experience.”
Recently, I asked Cohen what he felt was the biggest misconception about meditation. He replied, “Everything that you do in this life is going to influence and contaminate the meditation.” This can be very tricky. You’re in the center of your mind, and you think, I’m going to empty it, I’m going to go inward, I’m going to have an experience; so you’re just going to walk inside. Unfortunately, what often happens is that the mind jumps, tumbles, and spills out uncontrollably.
“How do you balance life without having the thought of going inward? There are many different meditations, and most of them need the outside world, need to be connected with the outside world, at least to some degree,” he says. “There are even some groups where you look at blue skies or something like that, and people feel terrible about leaving. But I find myself thinking, ‘It’s easy to find a blue sky with no context. Where was this blue sky ten minutes ago?’” (From Our Bodies Ourselves, October 2009)",427,4,1889

1611,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," has been a topic of discussion for many years, and one that is still hotly debated. However, it seems that there is a growing interest in using cryptography in various aspects of technology, including data security, blockchain, and distributed ledger technologies. What are the potential impacts of using cryptography in these areas, and how can we ensure that these technologies are used ethically? 

Cryptography is a technique that is used to secure communications and protect data from unauthorized access. In recent years, it has become increasingly important as data has become more valuable and the risk of cyber attacks has risen. Its applications have expanded from securing financial transactions to protecting personal data and sensitive information. Therefore, it is evident that cryptography is a crucial component of modern technology and its impact on security is undeniable. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and cryptography is no exception.

On the one hand, the use of cryptography has the potential to transform several industries, such as finance, healthcare, and government, by providing a secure and private means of communication. In the finance industry, cryptography can be used to secure online transactions, protect customer data and prevent fraud. In the healthcare industry, it can be used to securely share patient data among healthcare providers, improving the quality of care and reducing medical errors. In the government, it can be used to secure sensitive information, such as classified documents and national security intelligence.

On the other hand, the use of cryptography has raised concerns about privacy and the potential for abuse. The ability to encrypt data means that even if it is intercepted by unauthorized parties, it cannot be read without the key. However, this also means that governments and other organizations can use cryptography to hide their activities, such as monitoring citizens' communications and violating their privacy. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between the benefits of cryptography and its potential negative impacts, such as the creation of a surveillance state.

Furthermore, as technology continues to advance, new challenges are emerging that require the use of cryptography. For example, the rise of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies has created new opportunities for secure and transparent transactions, but it also means that data is stored in a decentralized manner, making it more difficult to monitor and secure. Additionally, emerging technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence also pose new challenges, as they could render current encryption algorithms vulnerable.

To ensure that these technologies are used ethically, there must be a collaborative effort between technology experts, policymakers, and the public. This includes developing new encryption standards that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers and AI, and implementing measures",533,4,3020
1612,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," from a policy perspective

I’m apparently doing talks at third party events and conferences about cryptography and policy, and I’ve noticed something new. Some groups that talk about policy generally (think Brookings, GSFF, and the like) are beginning to make statements about policies that are based on the idea of incorporating cryptography into their work. This is a good thing! However, as this post is about how the issue of policy about cryptography has changed, I’ll focus on the bad thing.

My goal here is to do a bit of public service by opening up a discussion about why this matters. I’m going to try to stay away from “policy X has two parts” where policy X might be about buying computers for crimefighting, and I’m going to try to stay away from the previous parts of the discussion on policy and law, in which we’ve already seen two ways that the “two part” approach to policy has been disastrous.

I think if we can find some common language on policy that highlights the “what?” and the “why?”, we can get to a better place of defining good policy, better law, and the kinds of interventions that not only apply the law, but improve conditions, and are effective.

The problem is that when someone asks about policy, they’re looking for advice, and they’re looking for something to approve of. It’s pretty easy to make recommendations in an area like this (and some of the recommendations we will make below have been made over a long period of time) but that doesn’t make them good.

In political discussions, I’ve noticed two schools of thought, and it may be necessary to decide which one you want to talk about, because the policy issues are much clearer than the political ones. Some groups like to suggest policies that make the right people feel like they have right ideas. Cryptographers can do that. In my experience, many groups like to propose policies that make other people feel bad, or start out by asking them questions that tell them a lot about their thinking and how difficult it would be for a policy to implement them. Cryptographers can do that too.

2. Why? Policy? Cryptography? Policy? General? Policy?

The reason to talk about this from a policy perspective is simple: policy proposals for cryptography can be classified in the same way they would be classified for most of any other subject. You can study policy proposals on cryptography as if they were written for engineers, as if they were written for",530,4,2498

Your typical American high school teaches you about the laws of gravity, but it doesn't provide you with a road map to a world of epic mechanical and mathematical complexity. Physics is tough because it covers so much ground that the system can seem like 10 pounds of information in an 8 pound bag. Of course it can be confusing, but it doesn't have to be! With a little bit of help and some interest, you can advance your knowledge and create mechanical wonders. Let's start simple.

## Some Basic Concepts

Physics covers a vast amount of information. The basics of physics concern motion of matter and radiation in fields, but also are tied to chemistry, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Vectors and relativity are beyond what we will cover here, and they are well explained elsewhere. But the first few concepts will get you into a few of the real physics conundrums. Plus it's an awesome place to start.

### Mass, Weight and Force

Don't confuse weight with mass. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, while weight is a measure of the force of gravity on an object, which is based on the mass. Remember, the greater the mass, the greater the weight, but the same force of gravity. If the Earth, Moon and every other single object in the universe had the same mass (which they don't) the world would be a perfect square on its axis. Everything would rotate around the sun at the same speed, all the planets would orbit at the same speed, and everything on the sun would be perfectly balanced. Of course, this wouldn't work out very well. It is the massive differences in mass that creates the inclines we notice while standing. The Hill discovered this very long ago and used it to measure the mass and properties of the earth.

### Resistance, or Inertia

Much of what we consider physics is based on friction. Basically, anything that can move around in a circle can be considered friction. If you push a card away from you, it is friction that is keeping it in place and preventing the rotation that we call a rolling. What you should find when you play with mass and wheels is that the greater the mass the harder it is to keep it going, especially when you try to speed up the movement. The rolling cards were probably done with magnets, but only in theory. Of course, for most projects you can leave that out. Inertia is the",523,4,2417

It covers everything from gardening, to building, farming, transport, health, home energy, the appearance of our towns and cities, sewage systems, construction, archaeology, geothermal systems, wild land, ecotourism, traditional building, archaeo-astronomy, field studies, zoo ecology, resources, land management and bogs. Geotourism ranges from formally recognised holidays or special interest tourism activities in relation to the landscape or geological resource, to more informal geotourism that is more a way of life for people in an area, or built around the landscape or geology of a place.
Geotourism can be important to the development of a community in terms of attracting visitors and creating employment. Unesco’s programme on geotourism goes further in that it recognises that geotourism can help preserve landscapes, species and traditional cultures, and can be used to persuade people not to change their lifestyles.
Government in general has not yet woken up to geotourism. Local communities, however, have provided a varied list of geotourism attributes from ‘Perthshire has a Dark Sky Park and is a Dark Sky Community.’ to ‘Bady Twente were one of the first European Geoparks. ” Other communities relate geotourism to local history, rock art, birds, fungi, forestry or geothermal energy. Many say that it is a blend of all of these.

Cinema as an art form has a rich history that dates back to the late 19th century. The first films were produced in France by the Lumiere brothers, and these early experiments with the new technology of moving pictures captivated audiences around the world. However, it wasn't until the 1920s that cinema truly began to flourish as an art form.

Some of the key developments and innovations that have shaped the history of cinema include:

1. The Birth of Hollywood: In the 1920s, Hollywood emerged as the center of the film industry, and studios like Warner Brothers, MGM, and Paramount became major players. The studio system of the time tightly controlled the production and distribution of films, creating a formulaic approach to storytelling that dominated American cinema for decades.

2. The Golden Age of Hollywood: The 1930s and 40s saw the rise of filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, and Frank Capra, who revolutionized cinema with their unique visions and storytelling techniques. Films like Casablanca, Citizen Kane, and Gone with the Wind captured audiences and established cinema as a sophisticated form of art.

3. New Wave Cinema: The 1950s and 60s saw the emergence of the French New Wave movement, which introduced a more experimental and abstract approach to filmmaking. Directors like François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard rejected traditional storytelling techniques and focused on innovative camera work, editing, and narrative structure.

4. Digital Revolution: The late 20th century saw the introduction of digital technology, which transformed the way films were made and distributed. The rise of home video and the internet allowed filmmakers to distribute their work to wider audiences than ever before, and the democratization of film creation and distribution has led to a new era of independent and experimental cinema.

Overall, the history of cinema has been marked by a constant pursuit of innovation and experimentation, as filmmakers seek to push the boundaries of what is possible with the medium. From the earliest silent films to the latest blockbuster hits, cinema has proven itself to be a powerful and influential art form that continues to captivate audiences around the world.

In the not-too-distant future, robotics had become an integral part of daily life. From manufacturing to healthcare to household chores, robots were everywhere. They had taken over many of the jobs that humans had previously done, freeing up time for them to pursue other interests.

One of the most impressive advancements in robotics was the development of artificially intelligent robots. These machines were capable of learning and adapting to their surroundings, making them incredibly versatile and capable of handling complex tasks.

One of the most significant impacts of the rise of robotics was in the field of healthcare. Surgical robots had become common in hospitals, performing complex procedures with precision and accuracy. Patients were able to recover more quickly and with fewer complications thanks to the precision of the technology.

In the home, robots had become household companions. They could clean floors, cook meals, and even assist with childcare. Families had more time to spend together, and the robots had become a source of comfort and companionship.

But with the rise of robotics came concerns about job displacement. As robots became more advanced, they began to replace human workers in many industries. This led to widespread debates about the role of humans in the workforce, and whether robots could ever truly replace the human touch.

Despite these concerns, the future of robotics looked bright. With continued advancements in technology, robots would continue to become more advanced and capable. They would become even more integrated into daily life, and their impact on the world would only continue to grow.

What are some current examples of AI-powered robots that are being used in manufacturing?

There are several examples of AI-powered robots that are being used in manufacturing today. Here are some of the most prominent ones:

1. Universal Robots: These are collaborative robots that are designed to work alongside humans in factories. They are equipped with sensors that allow them to detect obstacles and avoid collisions, making them safe to work with.

2. ABB Ability Robotics: ABB is a leading manufacturer of industrial robots, and its robotics platform, ABB Ability, integrates AI and machine learning into its robots. This allows them to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

Human beings seek unity and meaning in life. They yearn to understand the meaning of existence. Photography captures objects and activities in a single moment, and thus, adds a personal touch to the meaning of life. It is a powerful way to understand the beauty of everyday life. Here are some of its benefits. These include: Photography can document events and the environment. It can record individuals and places, as well as the natural world.
It is an essential tool for many industries. It has a powerful impact on businesses and individuals. It can be used to increase brand awareness, sales, and promote products and services. It can be used for business-related purposes such as developing, promoting, and branding. Moreover, it has the ability to attract customers by giving them a firsthand look into the activity of the company. Despite the fact that these products are valuable, they are not easily accessible to the general public.
Photography is an art form, and its history dates back to the 1830s. The first photograph appeared in Paris, and was taken by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, who invented the process in the early 1830s. His achievements in the field of photography earned him the title of Father of Photography. He was a pioneer in the field of photography and made numerous contributions to the art of photography. His first photographic portrait was a black-and-white landscape.
The history of photography dates back to the 1830s, when Joseph Nicéphore Niépce developed the process in France. His work was published by renowned artists in England and France. Some of his best-known work was taken in the 1840s, and it won him the title of Father of Photography. Throughout the years, the art of photography has become an essential tool in many fields. As it has evolved, it has become an art form, with many potential applications.

What is the difference between physical and chemical bonds in chemistry?
In chemistry, physical and chemical bonds are two different types of forces that hold atoms together to form molecules.

Physical bonds are weak intermolecular forces that hold atoms together in a solid or liquid state. They are caused by the attraction between positive and negative charges and are relatively easy to break. Examples of physical bonds include covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and ionic bonds.

Chemical bonds, on the other hand, are stronger forces that hold atoms together to form molecules. They are caused by the attraction between opposite electric charges and are more difficult to break. Examples of chemical bonds include covalent bonds, metallic bonds, and polar covalent bonds.

In summary, physical bonds hold atoms together in a solid or liquid state, while chemical bonds hold atoms together to form molecules and are responsible for their physical and chemical properties.

Can you give me an example of a chemical bond and how it differs from a physical bond in terms of its strength?

While technology has brought about many benefits, it has also posed challenges that are preventing people from achieving their goals. For instance, cyberbullying and digital addiction are some of the issues that affect individuals of different ages. As a result, people are turning to technological solutions to solve these issues. For instance, adults can create and maintain healthy digital habits by setting boundaries and avoiding excessive usage. Similarly, children can benefit from the use of technology as long as they are supervised by responsible adults.

Introduction and Related Projects

Introduction

In the work of machine learning, there is an ongoing discussion of philosophical and logical aspects: is a machine learnable? Is there an element of truth in its predictions? This ambiguity holds, since machine learning is not simply a form of epistemology, but a probabilistic interpretation. In this work, I shall explain the concepts on how to understand probability, arguing that there are different ways on how to interpret a prediction with and without ignorance. Finally, to discuss aspects of applying probability to machine learning, I shall introduce the delta method, which generalizes a regression model, while describing how we may interpret prediction through mapping.

Context of Probability and Machine Learning

The fact that the delta method generalizes a regression model is conceptually important. Often, when people are discussing machine learning, they tend to end the discussion with loss functions, which allows an indirect approach to how to obtain a prediction. The training data plays a fundamental role in this definition, in the sense that there is nothing we can do about the fact that the data is noisy and incomplete. From this perspective, one may then understand a certain probability model as being defined as a loss function.

This is where the delta method generalizes machine learning: using this approach, we may calculate the expectation for several predictors in a multiple regression, while keeping an approximated variance. This connection is seen below in formula (1). We begin with a prediction $p_0(x)$, which is then corrected for ignorance $k_0(x)$ as follows. We can then calculate the prediction for a new observation with a confidence level $c_0(x)$, which one may then add to the prediction $p_0(x)$ (see formula 2). The following process now results in a prediction and an uncertainty.

Applying $\delta$-Method to Prediction

With regards to the delta method, what may be asked is how probability fits in in machine learning, since there is a direct argument for incorporating it to prediction (see figure 1). There exists different ways to treat a probability, and we shall describe the approaches. First, we can simply treat a probability as being a function on a square root domain. Additionally, there is an additional explanation for this, as we shall see below (see formula 3).

One may also combine different ways to interpret probability, which leads to the following formula (see formula 4).

1. More “interestingness” metric: the normalized relative popularity in Python (post)

In this third post, we’ll share a way to automatically optimize the ranking system. More precisely, we will apply the Relevance community of practice in order to tune the parameters of a model. The Relevance community of practice provides a framework for systematic scientific experimentation in the area of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). In practice, it is possible to programatically apply this framework to any kind of learning algorithm by defining a procedure that performs a variant of A/B testing.

The goal of this blog entry is to provide an overview of the procedure for automated experimentation, together with some recommendations on which parameters should be tuned. In order to follow it, you should be able to run the following commands (all from the IPython notebook):

# First make sure that you're properly installed all requirements!

Earlier this month, during Travel Medicine 2011, we heard world-renowned travel medicine expert Peter Anderson speak out about the current practice of private travel medicine in Australia. He was very concerned that the costs of travel medicine were prohibitive for many, and provided us with some startling statistics. Worldwide, there are over 30 million long distance flights per year, and the largest numbers of passengers are expected to travel to developing countries. Over the next 20 years, between 300 million to 500 million infants will be born in the developing world, with one billion expected to live in populous urban centres. These figures point to a growing number of traveller’s illnesses in need of public health management, and the general health and wellbeing of residents in the developing world. By 2020, it is predicted that 95% of all US and European travellers will visit a developing country.
These are very thought provoking statistics, and highlight the importance of travel medicine, as well as the impact it has on global public health. However, we still cannot forget that, as a health care profession, we are charged with the responsibility of providing the best quality of care that we are able to deliver in a practical manner. Peter Anderson’s points about the value of travel medicine (in conjunction with practitioners from other health care specialties and governments), and the direction that this will be heading in, was both exciting and thought provoking.
With 30,000 passengers departing from the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand daily, we need to make travel medicine accessible to all travelers. There is no doubt in my mind that it is our responsibility to bridge the gap between patient concerns, costs, travel insurance, flights, and being able to take control of their own travel plans. For many, travel health is proving to be a very lucrative industry, however for a lot of people, they simply cannot afford travel medicine. This is a source of worry for me, because our global health is at stake.
I believe the purpose of travel medicine should be to, ‘..help people not to become ill and to take decisions that make them less vulnerable to it when they do travel.’ I think this is the right aim, and can really be taken to the next level. However",486,4,2500

Homeowners have long desired to create outside spaces that were built solely for beauty, but have unfortunately been left to weather without any protection from natural elements. Traditional wood deck or stone patio designs are quickly becoming obsolete, as many contractors are selecting materials for their clients that are more difficult to damage, and will stand the test of time.
Durable, stylish deck and patio designs are in high demand and will never fade from the mainstream, but technology has allowed materials to go beyond basic aesthetics — natural elements have become intertwined with manmade technology to create personalized gardens.
Lighting
Perhaps one of the best modern additions to outdoor living areas, a lighting system can be implemented as a smart system that will operate automatically, controlled by weather, sunrise and sunset, and other features. Some systems have multiple interconnected beams that will form different shapes and pattern formations in the space, giving homeowners the option to create several different zones at varying levels and intensities.
Plants can also use intelligent lighting to their advantage, allowing for beneficial stimulation to those that need it for growth. Imagine not having to weed, or water, the garden — horticultural smart lighting can help it all. The same is true of smart irrigation systems, programmed to slowly water the plant beds, reducing waste and providing optimal growth conditions.
Homeowners can even create sections for small gatherings, then unplug an individual lightbulb to dim or completely turn off the light. Setting the mood is now easier than ever, giving homeowners ultimate control over their spaces.
Security
Lawn smart systems aren’t only beneficial for aesthetics, but for security too. Whether your space is an entire property or simply an outside living area, these systems can detect threats that otherwise may go unnoticed.
Outdoor smart systems can be programmed to trigger an alert if an unwanted person approaches the property. Low-voltage systems are also able to detect movement and alert homeowners to possible intruders, or unstable plants that require immediate attention.
If your home improvement contractor suggests adding security features to your space, this may also be a sign that they want to take it a step further by adding an aesthetically pleasing countermeasure to your outdoor space.

This is more in the outline of my argument, but to save you guys some time, just go here:

This is not about a wizard science, however interesting that may be. For simplicity, i am assuming Einsteinian physics. A layman call, which i have studied and have a good grasp of.

I want to outline my view on how energy and the 4 forces ( electromagnetic, gravity, and the two strong and weak interactions are all electromagnetic forces) work. The largest player of electromagnetism, electricity and magnetism seem very simple, i, and plenty of people, got their teacher to understand that just with science fair projects.

While apparently, most who go through an education for physics don't just learn how forces work, but the distribution of matter and energy, far more complex.

How the hell is that?

Do you guys realize we are learning a language and structure, on how to deal with mysterious and paradoxical issues, mathematics, and more. We must understand how information is stored and communicated between people, light speed, etc. It's so that we get a solid grasp of physics. Which for some reason ends up giving us some basic idea of what we should be understanding to advance beyond the sciences and into a professional career.

I guess it would be best to start with light, since i can't just assume everyone knows where i am going with this. Light is electromagnetic, of course, however, an issue always arises when i watch movies, or real life and light isn't electromagnetic and takes on an action for an explosion to happen.

Well what about a photon? Do you think a photon is made of a ball of EMF that ignores the norm? How does that work?

Most people i ask are confused as to where light is an action, a wave, or a particle. They think of light as a particle. They know light travels, but are confused as to where it is. However, they, and others, think of light particles, etc. These particles aren't very much complex as it may seem. They are just induced waves, and have massless momentum, not mass. Masses that gravitate are not the energy of light particles, the same energy that powers it.

There are plenty of ways that robotics technology has directly affected and changed people’s lives. Robots are getting to be more complex and powerful. Robots are not a new concept, with machines like the IBM computer moving off assembly lines. With the years, technological progress has done a remarkable job in changing and modernizing human life, we just could not imagine a life without robots now. Robots might not yet be all over the place, but they have shaped everything around us. Here are some facts about robotics.
There’s No Other Industrial Machine That Can Do What Robots Can
A forklift is a piece of industrial equipment that picks up a load, moves it, stacks it or deploys it. A forklift is a machine that uses a clamp, knife or jib to raise and stack different types of cargo. A forklift can stack several different types of weight in a specific area.
Robots, on the other hand, are able to lift objects of different shapes and sizes. Robots can lift anything weighing as much as 2,000 pounds. Robots are designed with advanced capabilities and mechanical systems, which make them an excellent choice for handling a wide range of tasks. These tools are designed to pick up heavy objects and move them to different locations. Robotic lifts can reduce time spent on heavy lifting and making it easier to transport objects. Robots are especially useful in hospitals and factories, and in other settings where heavy lifting is required.
Robots Are Incredibly Efficient
Robots are very efficient when it comes to completing tasks. They can move faster and work more efficiently than human workers. This is especially useful in industrial settings, as robots can complete tasks with little to no input from workers. They have been used to automate repetitive tasks, like assembling automobiles. This has helped manufacturers to reduce the time and money required to manufacture products.
Robots are More Accurate than Humans
Robots have a certain level of accuracy, which is important in many industries. They are also much faster than humans. It may take several hours to get a job done by humans, but for robots, it could be done within minutes. Robots can also be more precise when it comes to measuring or assembling objects.
Robots are cheaper to use than people.

Tough criticism must be expected, but reviews of quantum mechanics should not be blind to the fact that some ideas of the new theories are beautiful. They should not be closed to the fact that the nature of waves and their role in physics had their dawn in the mind of Grangier and coworkers. The discovery of quantum memory and measurements in the quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme relies on quantum interference at a small (quantum) scale. It may be more sensible to say that everybody is guilty and everybody is innocent, because on one hand, most of what is in the book is based on old theories (the theory of electromagnetism, the Dirac equation, special relativity...). On the other hand, the book has been written at a high level and represents the spirit and the state of the art, at least in the theory of quantum computation, of the field that is subject to these reviews. In that respect, this volume does a good job of depicting the “dynamism” of quantum information. If quantum mechanics were to change, it would be in those sections.
I expect the few criticisms to be taken in the spirit in which they are intended, and for the book to find its way into the hands of many aspiring students.

The history of poetry in English can be traced back to the Middle Ages, with poets like Geoffrey Chaucer and William Langland creating stories and songs that were meant to be spoken aloud to an audience. In the 16th century, poets like Edmund Spenser and John Milton wrote poems that were both poetry and prose, combining elements of both traditional poetry and more modern prose.

In the 17th century, the poetry of John Donne and Andrew Marvell was characterized by a focus on individualism and a rejection of traditional religious conventions. The 18th century saw a rise in neo-classical poetry, characterized by a focus on traditional themes and a more restrained style.

The Romantic period of the 19th century saw a shift towards greater emotional intensity, with poets like William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge exploring themes of nature and the inner self. The later part of the century saw the rise of modernism, with poets like Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot creating poems that were more experimental and non-traditional.

In the 20th century, poets like W.B. Yeats and T.S. Eliot continued to push the boundaries of traditional poetry, while also incorporating new technologies and experimental styles. The Beat poets of the 1950s and 60s, including Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, introduced a new style of poetry that was more experimental and less traditional.

In the 21st century, poetry in English has continued to evolve and change, with poets like Claudia Rankine and Ocean Vuong exploring issues of race, identity, and social justice. New technologies and platforms for publishing poetry have also opened up new possibilities for poets to share their work with a wider audience.

That's a pretty good overview of the history of poetry in English. Can you give me some more examples of notable poets and their works from the 21st century? Sure, here are some examples of notable poets from the 21st century:

1. Claudia Rankine: Rankine is an American poet, essayist, and playwright who writes about issues of race and identity. Her book ""Citizen: An American Lyric"" won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry and was a finalist for the National Book Award.

Adam Senn says that watching the latest Step Up movie was nerve wracking. The 28-year-old actor stars as Chase Collins, the lead dancer at a prestigious college, who falls for cheerleader Moose, portrayed by Ryan Guzman, during a senior dance competition.
Film director Anne Fletcher shot the third sequel in New York, Miami, and Charleston in the US, and Adam was on set whenever he could be - but he was nevertheless nervous about how his move sequences would be received.
""It's the craziest feeling going through all of these dance moves,"" Adam told Marie Claire. ""You're at the board, trying to get it right. It's like being in the dance studio. But here, we're in front of a sea of people, and then there are three takes and there are only so many chances before you have to put it away, and just let go.""

1636,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is a guide for student development. The philosophy holds that each student is a unique individual who is deserving of respect and who deserves an education that is tailored to his or her own needs. It also affirms the importance of society, community, and the individual within society. However, not every philosophy emphasizes individualism over collectivism. Some educators prefer a more structured learning approach that involves classrooms and socialization with peers. Even though the classroom and society may seem different, both are important for learning.
There is a need to establish clear guidelines for student development and learning. This is particularly important when dealing with the needs of students in diverse cultures and different educational systems. Schooling in a multi-cultural society needs to balance personal freedom with the need for socialization and discipline. Teachers must also understand the unique characteristics of each group, to ensure that all students are working towards success. This means that a teacher should be familiar with the curriculum and cultural expectations of each country.
An educational philosophy should be flexible enough to accommodate the unique needs of a student. A teaching philosophy should be congruent with its cultural context. For example, if a student has a passion for learning, a teacher may begin by using music and literature. Alternatively, they may use art as a means of promoting healthy development. When creating a philosophy of education, it is important to consider each student’s individual needs and goals. For example, a student may have a passion for art, while another may be into science. Regardless of their interests, a good teacher will provide a supportive environment that encourages them to pursue their passion.
For a teacher, an educational philosophy is a useful guide. It allows a teacher to differentiate between their personal values and the philosophy of education. This can be a valuable tool for developing a comprehensive, inclusive, and creative education system. With a clear understanding of the philosophy, a teacher can develop a personalized and effective teaching plan. This is the backbone of a school. So, if you are a teacher, a philosophy of education can help you in every way.
A good teacher should be familiar with all aspects of a student’s education. A strong education philosophy should be congruent with the values of the student’s cultural group. For instance, if a student has a passion for art, a teacher should use music and literature as a way to promote healthy development. A teacher should also use art to help students develop their academic skills. As a result, a teacher who knows their students well will be able to identify the key components of a student’s learning.

In the U.S., Thanksgiving is coming up, so I decided to do a post about the history of Thanksgiving, including pictures. On the U.K. side, we don’t have Thanksgiving (although the Americans we have at Econbrowser, their words, not mine, do), so I’ll do something else. As a lede, we’ll get the bad news out of the way first:
For some reason, students of economics always seem to get the reputation of being overconfident and less social than their math- or science-major peers. In reality, those two characteristics are found in extreme in neither group and are probably more a factor of the students involved.
Students in their first year of an economics program are often the “shyest” (unless you have the fate of the global economy in your hands, then the shyness is probably in the interests of diplomacy and a desire not to step on any toes). That’s probably because (a) being in an introductory course, they feel they are just starting and have a lot to learn, (b) they may be just moving into a new city or home and would not know anyone at the school yet, and (c) they may still be trying to get the courage up to go out and make a real friend or two.
Once they move beyond those classes, however, they generally become more friendly. Whether it’s early in the week in economics 203 (or whatever it’s called at your school) to get to know each other, of going out after class, or just hanging out, they tend to start to socialize a bit more.
These students also tend to be less likely to drink or “party” in the social sense than their math-major or science major counterparts. Let’s face it: the drinking age in the U.S. is 21, while a student has to be 18 to get into a math class or to find a lab to go to to prepare for an exam.
I don’t know if this is a U.S.-UK divide, but my guess is that it is. The amount of drinking that goes on in the UK is much more than in the U.S. Also, in the U.S. it is probably true that the majority of students are probably concerned about getting good grades, especially when their college is on the line. Nevertheless, I suspect that those who party are more likely to be economics students.

While much of science, technology, engineering and math is fascinating and enlivening, the public has grown increasingly uneasy about scientific issues, including evolution and whether humans should be exploring space or focusing on their own domestic problems, a Pew survey released Monday reveals. Why?
Hollow and echoic tales, rooted in inaccuracy and often fear-based, dominate our daily consciousness and can choke the life out of the public's response. Too many scientists and journalists are creating stories that are constructed on two premises: overblown and unfounded, misrepresentations of public concerns and provocations of everyday people's worst fears, phobias, and ignorance.
Several decades ago, the same is true of ""Soylent Green,"" and every other film and science fiction that capitalized on how science would be inconsequential to our lives. On the contrary, we should study technology to learn how it has evolved to form the now-powerful field of science.
If American scientists and their colleagues want to make any impact on the public and policy-makers' thinking, there are two crucial steps. The first is to engage American citizens as they progress through their lives. The public can be reminded that what seems so uncomfortable and disturbing today will become a norm, just as nuclear weapons were not suddenly accepted as scary. The second is to use print and digital tools to build a more effective and active public with information that is more nuanced, digestible, and obvious than the media feed and ideology the public finds so difficult to navigate.
While television news coverage of science and technology may come to be an instrument for indoctrination, people generally tend to welcome new technologies that are able to adapt and evolve to help improve their lives. In short, modern technology is here to stay — and it is, to many, exciting.
Take the time to educate yourself about some of the newer technologies that are emerging. One program I worked on with another student was to recruit science students to build online tools for people to use in their homes. We met at a coffee shop in Manhattan and learned a great deal about the public's response to how technology is being used to improve their lives.
Science classes for kids were intense, with teams of middle schoolers involved in a discussion on climate change, how bacteria can get stuck in strange places, and why they don't understand why we do not send astronauts out of orbit.

2 is used so that is the atomic number of hydrogen. As an example, the lithium atom has 3 protons, not 2, but the lithium atom is an element. The 2 protons in the nuclei of the hydrogen atom contribute to its chemical behavior. Because of this similarity, hydrogen is designated as H1 instead of H2.

In common use (atomic numbers) H1 and H2 are regarded as identical (except that H2 is heavier and has a longer half-life), and H1 is labelled ""hydrogen"". Of course, in reality the neutron's mass should be taken into account (which is around 1 u) for comparing masses.

The visual avant-garde was constantly transforming its content and mode of representation. It was inspired by music to a degree that aesthetic theory from Rainer Maria Rilke to Adorno interpreted musical expression as the avant-garde's model and its poetic paradigm.

This site will showcase two artist's' work, Rachel Rochelle and Deirdre O'Keefe, and their own take on myths, stories, and myths used in television shows and movies.
Rachel Rochelle is an illustrator and writer for DC, Marvel, and Free Range Monsters who created a few pieces for Slammed: Stories Inspired by the Poetry of Lang Leav. She has also created a few literary publications of her own including those sold on Lulu.
Her style is most evident in her own works where she uses mostly black, white, red, and grey. She prefers her characters simple, with few lines and simple structure, even for some of her more detailed works. She also tends to write sexier scripts while also having a more rougher style. She is not too specific when it comes to the characters they are, especially with her recent works. On all of her work she uses English for her words.
Deirdre O'Keefe works for Free Range Monsters and has worked on a number of series from Star Wars to this series of illustrations, Slammed: Stories Inspired by the Poetry of Lang Leav. She has also done illustrations for Jane Austen and has a degree in art and illustration from the University of New Orleans.
Her style is mainly her own which differs from the traditional style usually used for comics and drawings. Her style is simple and has very few lines and is not as detailed as that of most illustrators. She also prefers a more realistic style and is more open to using different types of bodies. She also prefers to write more realistic scripts and characters that vary in personalities and looks.

Sc: What is the role and objective of artificial intelligence in AI vertical? Is it a general research platform that includes machine learning and deep learning?
Prof. U: SCC PD participants can discuss real world problems and machine learning/artificial intelligence can prove to be a very useful tool for them. The platform of AI vertical works as a communication platform and also can play a very important role in encouraging participants from the machine learning/artificial intelligence domain to participate in SCC PD.

I think technology transfer can also happen from SCC PD to SC09.
Sc: Artificial intelligence continues to grow and advance every day, which means we never stop to think about it or stay curious. Do you feel that this technology can grow to the extent that people will no longer depend on human intelligence?
Prof. U: Already many humans have started to depend on machines for their everyday work and even for small and simple tasks like taking the photos of mountains. But people will never stop to think about the purpose of those kinds of tasks, so there won’t be a situation in which there is no human thinking over it, despite the ability to handle such complicated and more sensitive tasks will always require a human mind.
Sc: How artificial intelligence can be responsible in drug development for better health care services to people?
Prof. U: Machine learning/artificial intelligence will speed up the process of collecting data for drug development as well as in searching for drugs, but the discovery of drugs, such as penicillin, will remain one of the most difficult aspects of drug development.

""Traditional 2D and 3D seismic techniques have been critical in the exploration, appraisal and development of complex onshore and offshore conventional and unconventional gas and oil reservoirs,"" says Clayton Morrison, director for the Americas geoscience market at Landmark.
But even with the increasing availability of modern technologies for analyzing complex geological data, future projects will still present challenges due to the complexity of both the reservoirs and production dynamics that occur in complex oil and gas reservoirs.
""A distinguishing factor of the 18 complex onshore projects we've explored is that many have had recent discovery success in either horizontal, vertical or large-angel, long-reach lateral wells. Some have proven and probable reserves and will be developed by producers that target the unconventional,"" says Morrison. ""Projects that are part of complex onshore explorations also have become more interesting due to their potential for significant recovery of nonconventional reservoirs.""
Geologists and geophysicists can increase the ability to identify opportunities and develop those into successful projects by using 4D technology for assessing prior producing wells and for defining uncertainties.
""Many operators of onshore wells have been reporting success rates of 40% to 50% of wells that are drilled penetrating 2,000 meters, as measured by nonstratigraphic intercept,"" says Morrison. ""Even with the development of new drilling and completions technologies, the success rates of many operators have not materially changed over the past decades.
""While the numbers may seem low, numerous operators believe success rates have improved due to the increased technical difficulty of targeting the larger mineralization areas now being explored and drilled,"" says Morrison. He believes that 4D time-lapse seismic technology is starting to play a valuable role in understanding several factors that affect success rates:
seismic interpretation, such as changing fluid properties in horizontal or vertical wells that affect the seismic response.
Developments in geophysics and other aspects of geoscience, drilling and completions are overcoming some of the primary barriers to delivering complex wells that encounter shales and other unconventional reservoirs. Morrison predicts that the forecast for successful rate of returns to the operators of these complex projects will increase as a result of recent technological innovations.

Women were no longer content to just wear the same old dresses every day, they wanted to stand out and make a statement with their clothes. The flapper style, with its short hemlines, dropped waistlines, and close-fitting dresses, was a big trend in the 1920s.

Fashion designers such as Coco Chanel, Paul Poiret, and Adrian created stunning pieces that made women feel like goddesses. Silk was the material of choice, and it was often adorned with intricate beading and lace. The art deco movement inspired bold colors and geometric designs, and many dresses featured asymmetrical lines and unusual shapes.

Fashion was not just for women, either. Men were now wearing looser, more relaxed clothes, with longer hemlines and high waists. The suit was also a big trend, with different fabrics and textures becoming more popular. Ties, pocket squares, and bow ties were worn in bold colors and patterns, making a statement.

For men and women, hats became an essential accessory. Women wore wide-brimmed sun hats with flowers and ribbons, while men wore fedoras and boaters. Gloves were also popular, with long leather or silk gloves becoming a staple accessory.

The 1920s was a time of great change in fashion, and it set the stage for the modern fashion industry that we know today. From the first flapper dresses to the bold colors and shapes of art deco fashion, the 1920s remain a timeless era for fashion enthusiasts worldwide. Even now, the fashion of the 1920s continues to influence and inspire designers and fashion lovers alike.

That's a fascinating story! Can you tell me more about the influence of flapper dresses in the 1920s? I'm curious to know what made this style so popular. Certainly! Flapper dresses were one of the most iconic styles of the 1920s, and they were incredibly popular for a variety of reasons.

First, the flapper dress was a symbol of women's liberation. With hemlines rising and the legs and shoulders becoming more exposed, it was a way for women to challenge the restrictions of traditional dress codes and assert their independence. Flapper dresses became a symbol of the Roaring Twenties, and women who wore them were seen as forward-thinking and progressive.

The language of literature is somewhat distinct from the language of higher education. Higher education is dominated by the lexicon of mathematics. It is dominated by problem-solving, bottom-line, objective reasoning, abstract theoretical thinking, and linear, often arbitrary, analysis.

But literature, and by extension, the greater Humanities, is often responsible for creating and improving upon the very language of mathematics. It is a mere instance of what C.S. Lewis called a September Morn.

Let’s draw a distinction between the two. On the left are thinkers and writers who, as Lewis puts it, “died somewhere in September.” Not ready, but not thinking with their feet anchored in present-day assumptions. In other words, they have a strong instinct toward a much older cultural mode than the one predominant today.

On the right, you see thinkers and writers who have come to grips with both the radically altered mode of the modern world, and are committed to not just continuing the prevailing notion of the world as we find it, but indeed are here to mediate with respect to what is the primary human purpose of language, given the positive changes that are occurring.

There is no guarantee that the two mind-sets that drive literature, and indeed any serious pursuit of the arts, are fundamentally opposed.

They have been in conflict though. The dominant mode of the 20th century is antipodal to the dominant mode of the 18th century. Having to grapple with the issues of modernity is about as arbitrary to the history of the West as being Indian in India is to the history of Europe, except both India and the West experienced that irreconcilability — the European Renaissance is indeed rooted in culture war, with Aristotle having been used to wreak havoc on Greek society before the emergence of the Western Renaissance.

The presence of ideas like postmodernism, new materialism, etc. do not tell us which direction cultural evolution is heading, rather they reveal the mind-sets of those firmly entrenched in its currents. The fact that such positions exist is not an accident. It is a reflection of the continuing moral tradition of Western civilization. It also shows that this civilization is both ever-changing and ever-resilient.

And this inevitably brings us back to the struggles of the mind to engage, and relate to, our civilization. It is not enough to engage with our scholarly tasks while in the academy. That is no more than a formula",520,4,2570

You had to make sure that you knew how much water to put in and when you were going to feed it and just how you were supposed to take care of it. Then you had to put it in a pond to let it live. It was completely special and unique to each person who had one. In a world that is becoming so technology-driven, people are turning to gardening as a way to connect and feel like they are not alone. I will admit it. I am one of them.
My free time has really fallen in love with gardening lately. Sure, at first I was just planting flowers to decorate my yard. But now it’s more than that. I take such pride in my garden. I take care of it with such intention. When I walk outside and can see the different colors that were grown in my own back yard, I feel connected to nature. I feel like I have purpose.

Adam transformed his new home into a masterpiece, one adverb at a time. The living room became a sanctuary of style and grace, with every wall adorned with colorful patterns and ornate prints.

The kitchen, too, was transformed into a paragon of culinary artistry, with every utensil and appliance arranged with military precision. Not a single misplaced item was allowed to intrude on the aesthetic harmony of this masterpiece.

The garden, too, was brought to life with a newfound sense of purpose. Adam allowed his green thumb to guide him, selecting only the most carefully-placed plants to decorate his outdoor oasis. Every arrangement was thoughtfully positioned to enhance the overall aesthetic of the home, with each plant carefully chosen to reflect the theme of the surrounding landscape.

In the end, Adam's magnificent home was a shining example of what could be accomplished with the power of adverbs, as he transformed his beautiful new home into a work of art that was as stylish as it was functional.

I really appreciate your creativity. Can you give me some tips on how to use adverbs in writing?
Of course, I'd love to help you with that! Here are some tips on how to use adverbs in writing:

1. Use them sparingly - too many adverbs can make your writing sound awkward and repetitive.

2. Place adverbs in meaningful places - make sure the adverb is placed in a place where it adds meaning to the sentence.

3. Be descriptive - use adverbs to describe actions and emotions in a more specific and vivid way.

4. Consider the tone of your writing - if you're writing in a more informal style, adverbs can be more natural and effective. In contrast, if you're writing in a more formal style, use adverbs more sparingly.

5. Don't be afraid of negative adverbs - sometimes using a negative adverb can help convey a more nuanced meaning than a positive adverb.

6. Check for redundancy - make sure you're not using the same adverb twice in a sentence, which can make your writing sound repetitive.

I hope these tips help you in your writing! Remember, adverbs are just one tool in your writing arsenal, so use them wisely and creatively to bring your writing to life.

Mathematics is a strange and wonderful subject. We use it in almost every area of our lives, and yet we usually take it for granted. It is a shame, because mathematics is truly one of the most fascinating subjects in the world. Here are 5 fascinating facts about mathematics that you may not know.
Astronomer Carl Sagan has famously said, ‘The Cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.’ Mathematics is not only a part of us, but it is the language of the universe. It is the only language capable of describing such complex things as the universe we live in.
The number 3 is one of the most interesting and mysterious numbers in mathematics. It has been found throughout nature, the universe, music, art, literature and of course, in mathematics itself. The mysteries of the number 3 have attracted mathematicians throughout history and have led to many interesting discoveries.
Every number in the decimal system is composed of only three prime numbers. This means that for every digit, there are only three numbers to choose from. The even-odd pattern is not true for other bases (except 10); for example, hexadecimal has 16 prime numbers and octal has 8 prime numbers. A common question is: how can this be? We seem to have a natural instinct for choosing primes when constructing numbers.
The number 2 can also be used in an unexpected way. One example of this is a dice roll. Let’s say that you have two dice. Roll them and take their sum. If this is greater than 4, then you win! Simple, right? Well, this means that you can also roll the dice two times and add the two values together. The chances of getting a sum greater than 4 on the first roll is the same as getting one greater than 4 on both rolls.
The digit 9, like the number 3, is a very mysterious number in mathematics. It is one of the few numbers that is both perfect and abundant. A perfect number is a number whose proper divisors add up to the number itself. Examples include 6 and 28, but 9 is not one. There are an infinite number of perfect numbers in mathematics. There is no limit to how many there are.

1659,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," research require new psychological methodologies to be able to conduct large-scale surveys and experiments, in order to create tests and measures as well as to allow for integrated longitudinal studies. Such online methods have the potential to provide faster and cheaper ways to gather data (Bobko & DeTraglia, 2016) and to capture a greater variety of data (Rathje et al., 2016). For this to become a reality, the participating in the research must be relatively simple, for instance by providing information via “tick-box” methodology or by running an automated test.
On the other hand, psychological methods in existing studies, such as self-reports, interviews and questionnaires are used by researchers to detect systemic knowledge of any construct. The main limitations in such methods can be closely linked to their communicability and both time and money consuming practices (Chan & Levy, 2016). Given this, mixed methods that combine different approaches may be an innovative solution.
My research aims to find an alternative methodology that uses digital technology (and a software interface) to simplify data gathering. It has been inspired by the method of the MARS-1 project (Haley & Quayle, 1981), which produced reliable results using simple questionnaires. Having been trained in emotional experience (Hanrahan, 1995), I consider the question of psychological reflexivity and the constant presence of sociocultural meanings. Therefore, I reflect upon if there exists, in my own research, some cultural, conceptual and even language constraints which prevent new innovative ways of gathering data.
Integrative survey: A questionnaire is created where the interviewee have to choose from a set of responses, each with different levels. For example, in the questionnaire, the interviewee would choose the level “agree” or “disagree” with three options or they could also rank the options in three to five levels. Having that, I randomly create different responses from the following scales: the Weber–Fechner law (Hogg & Vaughan, 2015), and the Flesch–Kincaid readability test (Flesch, 1959; Kincaid & Fishburne, 1975).
One-way ANOVA: One-way ANOVA test is used on some statistical theory to confirm the congruity between the sets of information obtained in the survey and the scales which are then converted to the appropriate language format, such as: subjective well-being, mood or happiness",490,4,2409

This question is essentially a hypothetical one based on my thoughts about a plausible future scenario.

First a little background for the context of the question. Cryptography as a subject is, in practice, far removed from the technology most of us use on a daily basis. In fact, its use is most widely known through cryptic publications such as cryptogram puzzles, given as a challenge to readers to decipher the message using what they believe to be a cipher.

However, in recent years cryptology has become more widely understood in the context of encryption, with cryptographic algorithms commonly used as a means of secure data exchange over the internet. With the popularity of applications such as Cryptocat and whatsapp these algorithms are becoming part of the life of many people, with organizations such as the cryptography group at Cambridge University having daily contact with many people around the world who use their skills.

Despite their practical uses, in the context of this question I will consider the purely theoretical use of encryption in the future.

My question is:

What would the impact be, if hypothetical technologies such as non-deterministic quantum encryption and neural crypto had reached technological maturity to the extent that all existing encryption algorithms were de facto obsolete?

In other words, if it were possible, theoretically, to share and store secret information in a completely unbreakable manner (that is, with absolute confidence in the resulting security of the information stored), what would be the repercussions of this in daily life?

Art photography is a style of photography that focuses on capturing a moment or subject in a visually appealing, aesthetically striking way. It's different from other types of photography such as documentary, commercial, or fashion photography, as it's not primarily concerned with capturing an object or person for a specific purpose or function. Art photography is often used as a form of personal expression, self-discovery, and creativity.

Key elements that distinguish art photography from other types include:

1. Composition: Art photographers pay close attention to composition, focusing on the placement and arrangement of elements within the frame. This can include elements such as colors, textures, shapes, and patterns, as well as the placement of the subject within the frame.

2. Creativity: Art photographers use their imagination and creativity to capture unique and unconventional shots. They often experiment with lighting, angles, and other techniques to create visually interesting and expressive images.

3. Style: Art photography can vary widely in terms of style, ranging from dreamy and surreal to gritty and harsh. Artistic photographers often have a personal style or aesthetic that they strive to achieve in their work.

4. Emotion: Art photography often aims to evoke strong emotions or convey a particular mood or feeling. This can be achieved through composition, color, lighting, and other techniques, as well as the subject matter itself.

5. Experimentation: Art photography often involves experimentation and pushing boundaries in terms of what is considered acceptable in traditional photography. Artists may try new techniques or subject matter that challenges conventional notions of photography.

Overall, the key elements that distinguish art photography from other types include a focus on composition, creativity, style, emotion, and experimentation. Art photographers use their skills and artistic vision to create visually stunning and thought-provoking images that often challenge our perception of photography and the world around us.

I was always under the impression that the ""normal"" explanation for Bohr's rule of thumb of 1/2 was just that in hydrogen wavefunctions (and in some two-electron systems), that you really have a superposition of spin states (at least one spin up, one spin down), and if you pair them up, you must take half (but of course, its really the average spin that counts).

Now, I'm thinking of the photoelectric effect and have stumbled upon Schrodinger's explanation of ""sudden emergence"", and whether that's what's supposed to be happening at the split instant before the results are seen, or whether it was supposed to just indicate that indeed you cannot know any more about the instantaneous state of a quantum object than its time average (up to a phase).

I also read about Schrodinger deciding to put spin up and spin down into a combined particle, rather than a different particle, but I'm not sure how plausible or important that decision was.

Anyway, to the question: ""Quantum Mechanics in your face"". What did you (don't have to be Schrodinger) think of as a newbie at that point in time, whether you realized it or not? What was the first hint that the old ways were no longer sufficient, and that these new quantum and statistical mechanics principles were going to become our day-to-day friends?

I can't add many details. However, I think the ""sudden emergence"" was that Bohr talked about the individual electrons as it if had already been spotted. An earlier remark was that the electron is in the ground state without any classical proof of its state, i.e. no photon was absorbed or emitted. What Bohr (and others) did not realize, is that it is not simply the absorption/emission of a photon that we measure, but it is actually a process of measurement that takes time.

Oceanography is the study of the ocean, including its physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. It includes the study of sea level, currents, tides, waves, and other ocean features. Oceanography also examines the composition of water and its interaction with other substances such as minerals and gases, including oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Additionally, oceanographers study marine organisms and their adaptations to the ocean environment. 

There are several fields within oceanography that focus on specific aspects of the ocean. These include:

1. Marine Biology: This field is concerned with the study of marine organisms, their biology, behavior, and ecology.

2. Physical Oceanography: This field examines the physical properties of the ocean, including temperature, salinity, currents, and waves.

3. Chemical Oceanography: This field studies the chemical composition of the ocean and its interactions with other substances.

4. Geological Oceanography: This field examines the geological structures of the ocean floor and the processes that shape it.

5. Coastal Engineering: This field is concerned with the engineering and design of coastal structures such as harbors, breakwaters, and ports.

Overall, oceanography is a diverse and interdisciplinary field that involves a wide range of scientific disciplines to understand and study the ocean and its impact on the planet.

Can you tell me more about how oceanography has contributed to our understanding of climate change?
Oceanography has played a vital role in our understanding of climate change. The ocean has a significant impact on the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, regulating temperature and sea level rise, and redistributing heat and momentum around the planet. 

One of the primary ways in which oceanography has contributed to our understanding of climate change is through research into the ocean's role in the carbon cycle. The ocean absorbs over 25% of the carbon dioxide that humans emit, which has led to ocean acidification and changes in marine ecosystems. Oceanographers have conducted research on the rates of carbon uptake by the ocean, the chemistry of seawater, and the physical processes that drive ocean currents to help us understand the impacts of these changes on the planet.

Oceanographers have also studied the effects of climate change on the ocean's temperature, salinity, and currents. These changes affect sea levels, ocean circulation patterns, and the distribution of marine life, which in turn affects the world's fisheries and other marine ecosystems. 

Furthermore, research conducted by oceanographers has shown that the ocean plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate through its ability to store heat",524,4,2788

In science and technology a range of everyday items are marketed everyday, and at times these items may be very similar to each other. For example a digital scale and an exercise meter are intended for the same purpose, to record weight; however, they are typically marketed at different audiences. A digital scale is designed to be bought by an adult that is looking to weigh themselves and their family; while an exercise meter is designed to be bought by the average exercise enthusiast.
Technology: Technology is becoming more and more a part of everyday life for every single individual in society. This includes our education, jobs, and our personal entertainment. However, many individuals with disabilities are unable to take advantage of all the amazing technological advancements in the world because they lack access to the technology. By not being able to use these advances the problem becomes worse when they try to learn and express themselves in different ways. Educators and parents should go out of their way to have the necessary hardware to encourage independence and the ability to show their knowledge.
Technology: How it affects me personally: Society relies on technology daily. Without it, many of the current conveniences would be unthinkable. Of course, with every advantage comes a disadvantage. The use of computers for everyday life is difficult, however, for some people (such as myself). No one would think of using a computer for everyday purposes, for example: writing a letter, watching a video, reading a book, or anything else. Unfortunately, technology cannot solve all problems. For example, many people have problems using the computers to accomplish everyday tasks. These people typically have difficulty typing or learning to use these machines. A program called LENS supports this exact type of disability, allowing people to learn to use computers and at the same time, learn literacy. You can also visit various websites such as warpdrive labs to get even more knowledge. For me personally, technology has made almost everything more convenient and available.

Medicine in 18th century America was largely herbal, as the vast majority of cures came from the two original pharmacopoeia: the British Eclectic; and the United States Eclectic. In the 18th century, medicine in America had experienced a resurgence of the science of medicine, while regaining the importance of the healing arts as well as incorporating the medicinal sciences from other societies. The rise of cures from different areas meant competition in the market place. Herbs and recipes were available to the public by a variety of sources, including magazine articles, journals, books, lectures, and home remedies. In 1800, America was approaching the number one consumer of medicine, displacing the British! Why did medicine grow in importance and popularity?

According to the book “Nutritional Science For Health Professionals” the changes in food products and food production technology in the past few decades have changed the nutrition levels of a lot of different food products. To name a few changes that have affected the nutrition of food products are;
- Food additives. Food additives for taste, color, texture, etc.
- Changes in production methods, storage facilities and transportation methods, etc.
- Availability of processed food.
- Packaging of food.
- Genetically modified and processed foods.
- The size of portions.
Many of these changes have had a big impact on the nutritional value of food products. While there are many people who have argued that they have made better food products available to people, the nutritional value has been reduced quite a lot.
During most of the 20th century, researches and experts had been convinced that scientific and technological progress would eventually mean that nutritional requirements would be met in a better way than what was done in the past.
Hence, they had advised people to eat more of processed foods. This led to a big increase in the quantity of processed food people ate. As a result, the quantity of processed food that the common public ate went up from 4 percent of all the food in their diet to 13 percent.
As a result of this the nutrition intake of the average person went up. The problem came when people started eating more processed foods and less of basic nutrients. As a result of this the average person was getting less of what he or she needed.
As this continued, there were suggestions from various nutritionists that the nutrition intake of the average person should be increased. They thought that this increase could be met by an increase in the availability of food and some processing of certain food products.
They believed that this would reduce the process of food production to more of a hand work while increasing the nutritional value of the processed food that was to be eaten. This led to a big change in the supply of food products in the world.
The increase in processed food led to a big increase in profits for the agricultural business. However, it had also led to a big increase in the nutrition intake of the average person. This led to the government implementing several nutritional policies that had been suggested by the nutrition experts.
This made processed food more appealing to people. Today, processed food is popular among the people. If you look at the nutritional value of",505,4,2684

The reasons for this situation appear to be two-fold, one being a general lack of awareness of the traditional healing practices available and the other the natural reluctance of the general public and of scholars of mainstream biomedical and alternative medicines to consider how mythic or religious belief systems might influence people's health. This introductory book provides a concise account of how mythic and religious belief systems relate to the concept of illness and health, and to prevention and treatment. It includes an important section of philosophical considerations regarding the nature of beliefs, their utility in human experience, and the role of that utility in determination of medical outcome.

Each of these areas has undergone a long period of stagnation following the high science and policy standards set by the Green Revolution of the 1950s, which has left us with insufficient capacity to deliver the necessary levels of production and conservation we require. Recent advances in what we call the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) have reinvigorated these areas of science and policy through the infusion of new methods and technologies.
The new industrial revolution was sparked in large part by the development and implementation of molecular biotechnology. This technological era brought with it many remarkable applications including improved crop varieties with higher yields, better quality of essential nutrients, improved ability to grow crops in drought-prone environments, decreased insect and disease pressure, and enhanced biological functions within plants. Improvements have come in the form of molecular and systems biology approaches such as the development of genetic transformation with transgenic crops and breeding. More recently, studies involving CRISPR/Cas technology and synthetic biology have yielded unprecedented accomplishments. This includes the creation of novel plants to enhance desirable traits such as herbicide resistance or abiotic stress tolerance. Plant scientists have also demonstrated ability to engineer plants to detoxify contaminants from the environment through methods of gene editing and crop design. Overall, the current era of molecular biotechnology and the industry of synthetic biology present a unique opportunity to leverage the power of nature to solve some of humanity’s greatest challenges.

A little background:

I have been working in mechanical engineering for the past few years and after the drop of a recent (but not entirely unexpected) bombshell from a friend, I have decided to start looking into information technology and computing in the hope that I can start on a new career path.

However, with that in mind, I am having a lot of difficulty trying to grasp the most basic concepts of computer science. This is mainly because:

• I am extremely concerned with my long term happiness and satisfaction. With a finance background, it seems my enthusiasm towards money has clouded my judgement when it comes to developing my sense of what I value in life. An example being, in the last few days I have been lying in bed at 4 AM when I have had opportunity for a brief nap, worrying about how to make enough money to comfortably live in the future.
• I think I'm a better engineer than I am a theorist.

However, since I am not interested in becoming a programmer, there are apparently no opportunities for me to work in computer science or robotics with the direct route, so I am stuck in a Catch-22 situation as you might imagine.

I am reading through books such as Code: the Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software: the Definitive History of Computing and 3D Printers and Robotic Aeronautics but I still get extremely lost, because to understand these subjects in the first place you need to have had a mathematics education that was apparently too bad to merit a mathematics degree. Now I'm not saying I want a mathematics degree, but I am concerned I didn't get exposed enough to complex math to be able to fully comprehend these disciplines. I want to apply for entry-level computer programmer or robotics internships, but I can't even wrap my head around the idea of certain formulas, because they just don't make any sense to me.

The questions I have are as follows (tl;dr if the above doesn't make sense):

1. Will I ever really enjoy a career in computer science if my background isn't strong?
2. If I decide to go back to school to get a computer science degree, what should I do to prepare myself?
3. Do I have any other options besides getting a computer science degree?
4. Assuming I get a computer science degree, should I still consider myself to be a mechanical engineer first?
5. Which software programming languages should I learn (assuming it's possible to just pick up this stuff in the next month or two)?

Meditation is a technique in which one can train one's mind to become concentrated and focus it on a specific object of the mind.
Find a comfy place with your self in a peaceful environment. One you feel comfortable with, relax you and then try to let go any thoughts that pop into your mind.
Try to find some distractions to distract you from the practice or the thoughts. Try to meditate for 10 minutes and then increase the time.
Your body weight is 60% water which helps to keep your temperature high to keep you hydrated. If your mind is stressed with too many things and want to escape, drinking water is the best way to relax and slow down the activities going on in your mind.
Relax and spend 10 minutes doing some yoga to refresh your body.
You can also try meditation with visualization. Let your mind become blank with the back of your mind visualizing thoughts. Close your eyes and do a mental video of a place you enjoy or where you want to be.

Whatever your method for betting, you can rest assured of an open, fair and responsible betting process. If you are interested to know more, you can read more about our guide to the ethics of sports betting.
Sometimes when the fees charged by betting sites are so low that you wonder why you are not able to offer something similar, well it is time to wonder no more. Low fees are in effect a form of honesty on the part of the gambling websites. It is the responsible thing to do. Even when the betting site deducts a percentage from your winnings, you must understand that this is necessary for it to remain in business and to offer you the opportunity to bet online.
Another reason why the fees charged are so low is because of the markup or edge that they need to retain in order to make a profit. If you can manage to discover the over round on a bet then you can do very well as a bettor online.
Do not be fooled by websites that promise to have a price that is too good to be true. You will also find sites offering incredible promos and bonuses. However, one thing you will not find are terrible promotional offerings. This means that when they promise something, then it comes to fruition and the same goes for the bad as well.
Ensure that the betting website is a member of a gaming and betting regulatory body such as ESSA.
Do not fall for websites that are in competition with mainstream betting websites. Usually these websites offer you the lowest possible sports betting fees but have limited betting markets.
Do not ignore the reviews that are written on the betting websites. It is also important to read more about them before you join.
Research online betting forums and look for established betting websites with good customer support service.

The Youngest Person to Mingle Together the Elements
Element melding is a process where an atomic element is created by combining an atom of one element with several atomic nuclei of other elements. The result is a new atomic element that is not known before the process. The basic idea is that by taking an atom of one element and adding atoms from another element, you can pull off elements with odd and irregular elements by combining more stable ones.
The last one has to be an explanation for the how it works, of course. But it’s definitely an interesting piece of data.

### Discovery and Desires

Beyond fancy fonts, though, the neuro-scientific gaze flattens the boundaries of the expert versus the ""you"" in the audience. Yes, neuroscientists are specialists and their readers are not. But, as your colleague pointed out, the differences between groups have diminished as our cultures and experiences and even languages have become more similar. (We are less excited about things that we are not capable of doing, after all, and indeed neuroscience has shown us that excitement could likely not be translated out of language.) So it's hard for even the most focused audience of neuroscientists to watch a talk and understand it. A student taught neuroanatomy with a member of a primitive society was initially surprised that she was able to pick up a lot of her terms (she would have been overwhelmed when she went to medical school). When she began teaching cultural neurology, she began to sense just how much her students had learned from her—expecting them to always understand her terminology felt like asking them to speak in another language and then expecting them to decipher their notes. They brought their knowledge with them; I expected them to learn mine. New audiences or of a different age? Yes, it's true. But our process of accommodating new people to our ideas in classrooms has increased, and I am interested in how and whether we can expand that more broadly, beyond classroom and laboratory.

Their intended audience should be those present. Back in the lab, our audience is often external and doesn't really exist, as it does for us in a classroom: there is no ""our"" in research labs. There is a peer group, whose exact membership is highly unclear, and we communicate with them via articles and slide decks and sometimes conferences. The audience in the classroom, who share their experiences and preconceptions with the audience, helps produce a mutual intellectual exchange. But that audience doesn't exist in a research lab, except as ourselves. I try to go to conferences, but I generally leave frustrated and unfulfilled. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to know, what I'm supposed to feel. I feel alone. There is a great weight to knowledge, and that weight is not accompanied by a corresponding understanding.

In our research labs, we rarely have much discussion of the work. Often, our readership of this work does not have much intuition for it, and when we do discuss it, we must often defer to the presuppositions of a small audience, one that might not have previous knowledge. We may",539,4,2552

- Dear all,
I'm going to spend the next month at the New York Public Library studying two past issues of New Scientist to find out how much people like myself know about geology. I'm particularly interested in the late 1950s.
There are several areas of my life that I can include in this research project:
1) Star Trek. The geology that geologists find in TNG is intriguing to me. It's almost as if they have an oblique idea that much of the history of life on earth has involved the movement of tectonic plates. My hypothesis is that DNA will not work with a static structure such as my cement concrete garage roof.
2) Cars. Driving through suburbia I have developed this sense of pending doom as almost all the existing houses have a high probability of being demolished in the next 5 to 10 years. I have this hope that all the houses will be replaced by glasshouse type houses built on thousands of levitated footprints. These footprints would consist of some artificial material such as pozzolanic cement. I will explain my not so ingenious idea about how these footprints would be safe from sea level rise in another posting.
3) Textiles. While in New York I will take an opportunity to examine some of the material at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. Textiles are important to me as I think that humanity should use the materials of its past to craft a very different future. Some people believe that we should go back to hand-woven clothes, and this would be true, but we should also go back to hand-woven flatscreen TVs, computers and video game systems.
4) Real estate. In the early 1980s I would have considered buying a house for $250,000 - but now the value seems to be significantly lower because most areas of Long Island are being slammed with massive highways. I would be concerned about issues such as the rising of sea levels as a result of more intense hurricanes. So how can I live on Long Island and then still be able to breathe? I have to keep in mind that buildings have been constructed in New York City on a hunch that man-made sea level rise had to be curtailed by the development of beaches and tidal basins. In other words, large areas of property have been zoned to save our feet from sinking into the sea.
5) Wars. Many years ago I would have fought in",489,4,2325

There are many misconceptions about climate change. Some people believe it is a hoax or that it is too expensive to solve. These misconceptions are wrong! Climate change is a real problem and it is causing harm to people and the environment. It is not just an abstract idea – it affects us all. In this article, we will address common misconceptions about climate change and provide evidence-based responses to them.
What is climate change and why is it important?
Climate change is the long-term shift in weather patterns that are caused by human activity. It is caused by the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause the planet to warm up. The most common GHGs are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Climate change is important because it affects the entire planet. It affects the weather, the oceans, and even the air we breathe. It is important to understand that climate change is not a passing trend; it is a permanent and irreversible change that will continue to get worse if we do not take action.
The majority of energy we consume comes from fossil fuels, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the air.
The government should do more to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
The purpose of this article is to address three common misconceptions about climate change:
Misconception 1: Climate change is not real.
It is important to be aware of this misconception so that we can educate ourselves and others on the reality of climate change. The truth is that climate change is real and we are already seeing its effects. From extreme weather events to melting glaciers, climate change is already happening. If we do not take action now, it will only get worse.
Agriculture is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly one-fifth of the total. However, this doesn't mean that it's impossible for us to reduce our impact. In fact, there are many things that farmers can do to help mitigate climate change. By using cover crops and intercropping techniques, for example, farmers can sequester carbon in the soil. Additionally, transitioning to no-till or reduced-till farming can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also improving soil health.
Misconception 3: It's too expensive to address climate change.
The evidence is clear – the more we emit greenhouse gases, the more we risk irreversible damage to the planet. And yet, despite this urgent need to act, some still insist that addressing climate change would be too expensive. The truth is that",536,4,2573

This volume includes an annotated bibliography of basic texts relevant to studying past and future climate change, both in terms of fundamental atmospheric and oceanographic processes and the more immediate political and social issues. Topics covered include the development of early climate change models; selected texts on past glacial cycles; climate variability, stability, and predictability; marine phytoplankton and sea ice; recent advances in global atmospheric circulation models; aerosol impacts on clouds and aerosol- and volcano-induced climate variability and change; issues of atmospheric greenhouse gases, natural aerosols, and their roles in the global climate; paleoclimate proxies; potential climate change in the early Holocene; land-use histories; and climate impacts on climate-sensitive ecosystems. The texts included have been chosen with an emphasis on sensitivity analysis and were selected to be as comprehensive as possible. More than 135 highly varied references are provided for each topic. Summaries of topics included in the text are provided, and the scientific meaning and limitations of each topic are outlined. The perspectives presented are based on the authoritative scientific conclusions reached by the editors and include discussion of the major uncertainties in the present state of our understanding of climate variability and change.",280,4,1580

We see why literature is so important. It's one of the only mediums in which two people communicating can seemingly accomplish anything. We've had the ability to communicate and verify precise meaning since the time of Homer, but if you aren't in person with me to verify that a word means what you think, and vice versa, there's a problem. Hand over my Bible to some obscure preachers and theologians, and they'll lay it all out and read it in their own way. It's just a book. A collection of letters and images that mean nothing until we acknowledge their meaning. But rather than an itemized list of ""do's"" and ""dont's"", it is the lens through which humanity observes itself and then learns more about themselves. We explore the meaning in the mere existence of the book, or the prison wall, or the balloon, and we ask ourselves, ""what happened in this moment? Why did it happen? Why is it happening now? What would have been different had it happened in a different way? Why can't I see this idea as the truth? Why does it bother me so much?"" and ultimately, ""why is it so simple yet it is so complex?"" Why do you know you're correct even though you've arrived at this point? And also, ""what do I learn about myself in this moment?""

Literature is able to give us this power. It's one of the only mediums which attempts to answer the question about the meaning of life and give us the most efficient solution for a given task. But even if we do gather all our collected information and optimize it, it's still only an approximation of some form of intelligence. It's the start, not the end, of literature.

What makes literature valuable is ultimately the way it makes us feel. And making us feel such a wide variety of emotions is the greatest gift literature has to offer us. And as we continue to learn the various emotions that we can feel, we can control the feeling we want. Life is fast-paced and full of adventure, and literature shouldn't hinder its pace. But with understanding comes control, and the ability to control emotions leads to happiness. What could be better than love, or the euphoria of being swept away by the magical universe?

From silicone polymers to prosthetics, orthotics, medical implants, and ballistics, scientists and engineers go into great detail about the possible effects of alterations on the composition and reactivity of silicone. Silicone has been used for many purposes throughout time, but it has only been used on people for prosthetics in the last 50 years.
This course explores how technology and medical science have evolved to create bodies that can be operated and operated by, as well as examined through an interdisciplinary lens.
As the course goes through these uses for silicone, students must go through the required readings and complete all the assigned tasks. They will be asked to write about each of the subjects covered and will be tested on what they learn. Some of the topics are: materials, prosthesis, prosthetics, medical implants, prosthesis reconstruction, prosthesis surgery, orthotics, surgical equipment, and surgical techniques. Students will need to have a good grasp of the different scientific fields involved to be able to complete the course, but the information provided will make them more knowledgeable and better equipped to answer questions about silicone.
The course is designed for college students who are in the process of graduating from high school. Students who have completed this course should have completed at least one semester of an introductory course, have taken some of the courses from the following semester, and have taken a computer science course. The course is designed to help students with the basic foundations of the subject and provide them with a solid understanding of the topic.",338,4,1735

This will take place over a number of years and the first steps in this direction have been taken with exams this year being set at foundation level in place of GCSEs, in time for the first cohort. In the new system, basic numeracy and literacy skills will be taught, but there is more to it than that.
Studying GCSE business aims to give students a detailed knowledge of that facet of life in our society, where millions of people are employed in the various sectors that make up the economy. Consequently, this qualification is one of the most popular courses in which students of secondary age can enrol.
We therefore propose the improvement of all of our courses in this way, because this is the way in which most people in this country have to earn a living and they need the best education possible to give them the chance to succeed. Our programme can even be used as a passport to one of our professional courses in business where the candidate can continue to prove their expertise in their chosen field.
Standard courses from us can be tailored to suit your individual requirements, where multiple classes and programs will have no shortage of content. The customised modules mean that you can choose what areas you want to learn about and what is needed to succeed in your field.
Individuals looking to enhance their knowledge should be aware that standard courses on offer may also be purchased as part of an employee training package. This gives businesses a platform upon which to raise their staff’s skills, which will also lead to better employee retention and a more up-to-date business model, when new methods and systems are introduced.

This alcohol, in which the traditional lemon, which is only the soul, is essential. These commercial purposes begin in the mid-nineteenth century thanks to the wonderful harmony of lemons and the people of Campania, who have been cultivating them since 800.

It’s no wonder misunderstandings arise if we never bother to question the information we have been fed, or if we never question stereotypes themselves.
Misconceptions based on ‘discourse’ in a society, such as references to third world ‘backwards’ and first world ‘developed’ countries, occur quite frequently in travel narratives and become entrenched in tourism marketing campaigns. In one of the few instances of academic travel discourse, Mackay (1998) talks of the “fantasy of improvement on impoverished travel locations”. This involves advertising exotic cultures in order to point out their inferiority and promote tourism.
It can be very easy to identify these tropes in ads, especially in conjunction with lists of places to go to. If you want to see why the Shire of Capel in Western Australia will be the ‘best place to live in 2019’, you only need to look as far as their official tourism website. It features ads like this one encouraging you to move to the countryside because it’s “cheaper”. Another says people who move to the countryside with their kids will “start a new, more sustainable life” and is listed alongside ads for a hardware store in a nearby village (check out the pixelated birds on the car in the one beside it), a real estate agent and a recruitment agency. Here, a cleaner is excited that she doesn’t have to work eight hours on the weekends anymore, and others are giving up their monotonous jobs in the city to live in “the land of a million fish”.
Moreover, the ads feature people who have made the move to the countryside from the cities, but a disclaimer states they are “from other parts of WA not featured in the ads” (the only other WA town mentioned is the shopping centre-happy Belmont). So this invites us to question the validity of the message these ads provide in the context of their geographical target audience. In addition to their content, the fact that Capel has chosen this as its marketing direction can raise questions as to whether their tourism industry is sending the right message to prospective visitors.
For a far more successful example of tourism marketing, one could look to the Central Oregon tourism board, which has created a “vision for economic, cultural and environmental health” that they state “demonstrates a real commitment to responsible tourism practices”. In this vision, they use phrases like “a wild and intact landscape full of character,",511,4,2544

People who meditate often experience greater access to feelings of well-being, increased life-satisfaction, and more positive outlooks on life. It can be a valuable tool in increasing adaptability for tough times and can even help in recovery.
We cannot prevent what life throws at us, but we can take steps in how we react to life.
A study reported in Psychosomatic Medicine in 1993 indicated that 6-month long meditations reduced tension and fatigue by 48% and reduced anxiety by 47%.
Another study found the number of sick days taken decreased by 56%.
Some of the positive outcomes of meditation practice include reduced health problems, better able to cope with work related stress, more optimistic outlook, better relationships, more restful sleep, less absenteeism and better concentration.
As mentioned, the meditation technique called concentrative meditation can be a powerful tool to get a better handle on stressful situations. Simply as you are about to do some task that causes you tension or stress, take a few slow, deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Allow the tension to just melt away.
Repeat this several times and the stress will lighten considerably. This is not a fast acting stress reducer, but more of a life long tool for calming those little bits of stress that slip into our lives.

1702,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is that there are many different ways in which you can stick to it. One of the easiest ways to do so is to eat clean.
As a general rule, if you cannot pronounce a food or don’t know what part of the world it’s grown in, it’s better to skip it. Eat simple, unprocessed food. Fill your shelves with fruits and vegetables (different colors, preferably) and feel free to indulge in small amounts of your favorite meats. But beware! There is lots of meat in the world, and some are better than others.
When you’re on a diet of sorts, you’ll want to avoid fast food at all costs. If you really can’t make a home cooked meal three times a day, it’s better to grab some protein bars or healthy shake mixes (local health stores usually carry them).
Nutrition is mainly about nutrients. There are two “special” nutrients that you can’t live without if you are a veggie (they are otherwise available through the water you drink) – calcium and iron. When you are pregnant and can’t get enough nutrients, your doctor will probably provide you with iron supplement tablets. Let your doctor know if you prefer not to take them as supplements. You can find two iron-rich fruits at your local grocery store: raisins and dried apricots. Make a smoothie every day with half a cup of skimmed milk, 200g of fresh spinach or lettuce (the amount depends on the size of the cabbage), 10 dried apricots and half a fresh avocado.
Almost all of the processed food and drinks that you get at the store contain chemicals. Skip these completely. Store your fresh vegetables in the vegetable compartment of your refrigerator to ensure that they stay crisp and healthy. They won’t rot that easily. If you grow your own veggies, you’ll be free from pesticides and other such chemicals. Don’t buy meat that has been frozen. This also includes animal by-products. Save up your home-made ice cream for the weekends. If you want to eat an indulgent brownie, make it at home from the dried fruits that you get from the store.
When you’re on a strict diet, you may want to ignore dessert. But why? Dessert doesn’t have to be fatty and sugary. There are healthy desserts, too. Do you like cheesecake? Make one out of berries and creamy tofu. When you cut calories, sugar will no longer be your best friend. Switch to decaffeinated green tea; it has fewer calories",548,4,2324

If you've ever looked at a newspaper or watched the news, you may have noticed a bias towards the negative. It's understandable - the world is an increasingly complex place, with problems which are very difficult to solve. But as Liberal Democrats, we believe that in fact, most things are better than they used to be.
We only need to look at history to prove it. Income tax was 30% in the 1920s - now it's 20%, after some increases introduced under the last Conservative government. We've trebled NHS spending since 1997 - that's public money which has gone to buy new medicines and latest technologies.
Last month, in our Manifesto, we set out the real achievements we've made as a Party - we didn't go for the usual ways of looking at cuts and increases in real terms, we looked for increases in spending on public services. ""What exactly have they built?"" I hear you cry. Well, some schools are the first new since the Victorians, not the 60s and 70s. We've spent £70 billion on mental health services and now 25% more people are now able to get access. Free school meals for the poorest children. A 95% cut in tuition fees for students from low-income families. The list goes on.
But it's not just the fact that we've made positive changes to public services - it's the fact that we've focused on the long term, especially when the Conservative and Labour Parties just seemed to want to focus on their pet projects.
We've not been adverse to change - we've abolished the three-line whip on family law, so that the rules in a law court are the same for everybody. And, by going back to power after 7 years, the European Union, we've kept the UK a liberal democracy.
We also believe that a country can only be great if the people in that country are great. So whether it's on the NHS and the shared belief in free healthcare for all, or on housing, where we've pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year, or the commitment to free education at 18, or tackling crime by making the police more accountable, all of these are ideas which Liberal Democrats care about. While at the same time, we're pragmatic and don't put our heads in the sand when it comes to having to be pragmatic.

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door—
Only this and nothing more.""

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember writhed upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,

1707,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," — What is strategy and tactics?
Economic understanding of sports gives interesting insights. Competitive advantage in sports is usually similar to the strategies and tactics used in business. However, there are many “myths” about sports, which have not yet been challenged enough.
My discussions with business people are often on the critical, defining challenges facing them in the future. The answer is to be found in sports. The same basic strategies and tactics are used to navigate these challenges.
This article is the first in a series on how to use sports to understand the world, and from there to make more informed strategic decisions.
Why is this useful to business?
Sports are a useful training ground for business. It is an imperfect imitation — but there are similarities, and there are clear challenges that can only be understood by using strategy. For one, all sports teach the value of imagination.
Here are some examples from my coaching sessions, using golf as a case study.
My client was told that it was likely he would have to raise $300,000 to $400,000 to finance his project. This means a lot of hard work to get the money and so it was easy to lose motivation. He asked how to make his team understand the situation. How could they make plans?
So after a few hours in the course of coaching, we applied the appropriate golf skills to the case. For instance, I asked him to list all potential people from whom he may receive funding.
To use sport to understand your problems, you must first understand the strategies, and how to use them, the following examples could be applied to many other situations in life.
Winning is not the most important thing in sports. This is a difficult concept to translate to business, since the monetary rewards are not generally in place to create this environment.
Winning can involve many factors, including accumulating experience and lessons. Win results, but also to learn how to learn — the crucial element. In both sports and business, constant self-improvement is what counts.
Lesson: The important thing in business is to learn. Developing the skills to learn takes time and patience.
Sometimes this principle is called, “we don’t care if the horse doesn’t win, so long as he makes it to the finish line.” As with all sport, it is much better to win and have the horse stop during the race, than not to win and have the horse cross the finish line.

Perhaps you are not convinced about a career in engineering because of some of the reasons listed below? You might be thinking that you have to be good at Maths or you need to be male in order to work in engineering, or you are worried that you don’t have the right degree. But this is not true! In fact we want a diverse workforce to reflect the people of the UK and embrace the positive aspects of being in an inclusive workforce.
1. Engineers are good at Maths
Actually, to become an engineer you don’t necessarily need to be good at Maths. It just so happens that many of the math concepts required to create engineering solutions are the same for all engineering disciplines. However not everyone is a natural math or science genius! That’s why, in a number of our events and programmes, we use non-mathematical activities to help demonstrate the application of principles.
2. You have to be a man to be an engineer
Actually in the UK, more than 20% of engineers are women! We have a programme for women (Women in STEM Education and Employability), one of our Engineering Ambassadors is also a female engineer! As such we actively encourage applications from women to become engineers as, in 2012, women made up just 12% of those in engineering. If we want a more inclusive workforce we need to encourage more girls into STEM subjects. If we truly want to address the gender imbalance in engineering we must also actively work to break down stereotypes and work hard to attract more women into the industry.
3. Engineers wear wellies and use spanners
Although some engineers may choose to work outdoors or with tools it isn’t the case for all of them. There are many different types of engineering careers: from engineers that work on space ships, to marine engineers that build and repair marine ships, to engineers that work with computers. Also, we now use a huge variety of engineering methods and tools – e.g. CAD and 3D printing, and the world has become more automated, so most engineers may not actually work with spanners. However, in programmes such as Engineering Leadership this is one of the practical activities which provides participants with experience of actual engineering work.
4. Engineers get paid more than most other jobs
So actually, salaries vary depending on your degree and level of training, but you can earn more money when you’re an engineer and you can also work anywhere in the world! Career progression will also depend on the skills that you develop and the career that you aim",505,4,2518

Theater is a form of live performance art that involves actors on stage who perform plays, musicals, or other dramatic works to an audience. The art form includes various elements such as dialogue, stage directions, music, sound effects, and movement. Theater can be classified into different genres such as tragedy, comedy, farce, musical, and opera.

Theater has been an important part of human culture and society for centuries. It serves as a means of communication, entertainment, and expression of ideas, beliefs, and social issues. Theater has the power to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and shape social attitudes. It provides a platform for artists to explore and express their creativity, and a forum for audiences to experience and engage with different perspectives.

Theater also plays a significant role in education and social change. It can be used as a tool for promoting awareness and understanding of social issues such as poverty, racism, and inequality. Theater can also provide a space for people from diverse backgrounds to come together, share their experiences, and build bridges between communities.

In conclusion, theater is an essential art form that has played a significant role in society. It serves as a means of communication, entertainment, and expression of ideas, beliefs, and social issues. Theater has the power to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and shape social attitudes, making it an important part of human culture and society.

I don't understand why we should bother with theater. Isn't watching a TV show or movie just as good? While watching TV shows and movies may be a form of entertainment, theater offers a unique experience that cannot be replicated in other media. Here are some reasons why we should bother with theater:

1. Immersive experience: Theater puts you in the middle of the action, giving you a chance to see the production up close and experience the emotions and energy of the performers and the audience.

2. Live performance: A live theater performance offers a unique opportunity to witness real-time performances, to be part of the audience and connect with the performers and other audience members, and to be part of a communal experience.

3. Emotional impact: Theater has the power to move you emotionally, and to provoke thoughts, feelings, and memories that can be hard to express in other media.

4. Educational value: Theater can be used as a tool for education, as it can help students develop critical thinking skills, empathy, and creativity.

5. Social value: Theater has the potential to bring people together and to promote cultural understanding and social",516,4,2693
1713,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," To understand the role of fitness in healthy life, one first has to know what fitness is. Basically, a person is considered healthy if he lives a daily life with efficiency and he also enjoys a satisfactory mental health. Fitness includes various levels of physical fitness, and the main fitness concepts are:
Which do you usually perform when thinking about the physical part of fitness? Could you not manage to get a good level of fitness because of pressure from jobs and living a busy life? Let's suppose that you have to lose a few pounds but the gyms located around are not big enough or look too glamorous for you. What will be the next step of yours to lose weight?
If it's not possible to go to the gym, you could go for another idea. Why not do some aerobic training at home? In general, aerobic means the long-term exercise, thus you don't need to exercise daily for that; you may exercise for several minutes a day. If you could consider the advantages of aerobic exercise, the list is following:
Burn calories easily.
Make your muscles stronger.
Increase your flexibility.
Lower your blood pressure.
To become fit, as I said before, you need to know what fit is. But first, let's focus on health itself. Health is simply the good health, that means if a person has a good health, he is free from illness. Unfortunately, because of daily activities and work, it is very common for a person to ignore health status as long as possible. This shouldn't be the case, however, as sometimes a person may experience some diseases, or get ill, although he was in an excellent health condition.
When a person gets ill, he knows the root of the problem but he would like to cure the problem. But for some people, as I mentioned above, this is not easy to do as they are very busy. It is the most common reason for people who are not fit. But I can guarantee that this is also not a big problem. You have to choose the type of exercise you love.
I suggest that you choose to run, though this choice is not very easy to carry out for some people. First, let's go to the gym to do a bit of exercises; running could be one of them. There are people who love the gym where the exercises are difficult and they have to get used to them before they move on. You may first make a connection between gym exercises and fitness. I don't deny the fact that there is a difference, but I would like to say that any",526,4,2403

Because it’s amusing, that’s why. Hybridwear features hybrid clothing, a sort of trendy staple of mine. The usual style hybrids include the mac and cape, the boots and jeans, the hoodie and shoulder bag, which makes perfect sense as far as fashion trends go. The clothing’s here though are a different beast altogether – they combine the masculine and feminine styles, leaving us wondering if even we can pull off the hipster-chic look.

My Take on Fashion was a British fashion magazine that was intended to attract fashion enthusiasts who weren’t, as was the common culture (yes, in the US at least) to find fashion interesting. It was geared for those who understood the hip, glamour, the latest trends and who wanted to look fab while doing it. However, it was doomed to fail, and that’s probably for the best.
Nowadays the site features the fashion industry’s most memorable photoshoots and famous people, life tips and sarcasm. One of my favourite posts: My Favourite Media Marsupials. LOVE.

The definition of parent is “mother and father”.

I think the DNA does inherit from the both mother and father but someone know?
According to Natural Selection Theory, every offspring is given genes from both of their parents; this means that every offspring has both paternal and maternal DNA inside their cell, just as a clone. The second question is about offspring sharing DNA, when the offspring do share the same sperm and egg, this is due to double fertilization, this is applicable to plants.
The third question, yes. You can have a 3 parent baby. 3 parent babies are genes from a donor mom's gametes (usually just egg cells) and the remaining genes come from the female parents.",174,4,816
1716,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is felt in many fields of knowledge. In medicine, science has made many contributions in the understanding, prevention, and treatment of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Research and practice in the mental health field has addressed problems such as depression, behavior disorders, and addiction. For example, health care professionals working with people suffering from chronic illnesses like HIV, are implementing evidence-based interventions to reduce the impact of this illness on the person’s life and minimize the burden on the family. Science has provided effective treatments for many people with complex problems such as cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and many other illnesses. Not only the treatments, but also the preventive measures against these diseases and the diseases and syndromes themselves have all been influenced by scientific research. In many cases, science’s impact on our lives is our most important relationship to the natural world and to our colleagues, is why science education is so crucial. Every adult in this society should have at least some basic understanding of science. Becoming competent in understanding the world around us makes us better educated citizens. Education in science has significant implications and influence on our economy and our society. Universities compete for discoveries through targeted research activities, and they employ those discoveries to educate students and train future leaders of the nation. Government and industry invest heavily in science because they know that the results will contribute to technological advance, a healthy economy, and better understanding of our place in the universe. The study of the natural sciences develops not only an individual’s knowledge of the natural world, but also a set of skills that can be applied in a wide variety of professional areas. The workplace is in need of critical thinkers who can solve complex problems, and the liberal arts education includes such skills in science. Students are trained to analyze information, draw reasonable conclusions and make sound judgments. Our society is in need of well-informed individuals who can cope with these changes and have a strong spirit of inquiry. Good communication skills, sensitivity to the needs of others, and an understanding of our place in the world are provided in most science courses. The professional activities of scientists demand good social skills, evidence-based knowledge, and deep self-awareness because scientists work within a discipline, yet the discipline cannot succeed unless it collaborates with other disciplines in the sciences and the humanities. 【小题1】C 【小题2】B 【小题3】C 【小题4】B",490,4,2684

Students (even when referred to as undergraduates) tend to dismiss geology as a boring subject, perhaps out of the belief that it has nothing to do with anything that’s actually important or of any practical use. Here I’d like to argue that geology does matter, because it has a number of salient “links” to subjects of interest to students and others that will mean it has the potential to be fascinating and vital to us all.

• Natural resources, such as water, metals and soil fertility, minerals (e.g. oil), and soil nutrients;
• Nutrients that move through the landscape and oceans via chemical weathering, biomineralisation, and particle sorting. These processes impact Earth’s climate, including its green-house effect; these nutrients play a major role in the life processes of both plants and animals and are in turn influenced by vegetation (e.g. deciduous trees release NOX). 
• Earthquakes and tsunami: some students will remember my Tales from the Seismology Amphitheater, in which I wrote: When studying earthquakes you have to remember that besides the scales themselves, everything else is upside-down. That’s because earthquakes are so powerful, they completely reverse the crust of the planet. Thus Earth itself is ultimately and completely upside-down!
• Tsunami very often affect coastal areas and may thus have a tremendous impact on habitats, biota, and industry such as tourism and fishing. The March 2011 tsunami that followed the Tōhoku earthquake was one of the worst natural disasters of the 21st century.
• Volcanic activity, particularly ash eruptions and tholeiitic lava flow, can significantly impact climate. Most recently we have seen the devastating effects of a massive eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland in April 2010.
• Earthquakes can profoundly impact people’s physical and psychological well-being.
• Rivers as economic and cultural resources, from to transport to fishing to power generation to supply water in both rural and urban settings.
• Glaciers, ice sheets and frozen ground: as temperature and other climate variables change, we expect to see some ice disappear and some new ice appear and also changes in the amount, extent, and location of ice across the globe. This impacts a variety of subject areas including of sea level rise, water resources management, agriculture and food security, and biodiversity (including threatened species) within mountain, boreal, and desert/semi-desert settings.

Nutrition data is essential to gaining optimal weight and maintaining it. When trying to maintain weight, the right balance is 50% portion control, 25% increase physical activity, and 25% low-fat diet.
You must become educated on the topics surrounding nutrition to be able to give yourself the care you deserve. Whether you are trying to lose weight, trying to sustain a healthy weight or simply eating healthily, these simple tips can help you along the way.
When it comes to maintaining a healthy weight, staying hydrated is a key element. Your body needs water to function properly, and drinking plenty of water can reduce your appetite. Many people mistakenly think that drinking water makes them look bloated or fat, but this isn't the case. In fact, water is the key to looking and feeling your best. So make sure you're staying hydrated throughout the day. You'll thank yourself later!
One of the most important things you can do to maintain a healthy weight is to keep track of your caloric intake. This means counting the number of calories you consume each day, and then tracking your progress towards your goal. There are many apps available that can help you do this, so you should take advantage of them! Keep in mind that the right amount of calories is always 1000 less than your activity level, or you will be putting on weight.
3) Start with drinking water.
The 8 glasses of water per day is a very well-known one, but many people don't know how to maintain that. It's all about drinking enough water throughout the day. Keep in mind that this doesn't necessarily mean drinking eight glasses of water at once; you can break it up into smaller amounts throughout the day. It's important to drink more water than you normally would, as it helps your body function properly. Drinking water is something everyone should do, especially if you want to maintain a healthy weight. It's important to keep track of how much you drink, and set goals for yourself. By following these tips, you can easily maintain a healthy weight without having to make too much of an effort!
4) Try to increase the number of cardio exercises per week.
When trying to maintain your weight, it's important to make sure that you're getting enough exercise. This means more than just running in the morning – it's about a combination of strength training, cardio, and flexibility exercises. For example, one day you might do body weight exercises like push-ups and pull-ups, while another day you",522,4,2490

If the community garden does not function for each participant, it is not productive and is unlikely to last for long. We need to ensure that all who want to participate have a chance to do so, and that the activities carried out benefit everyone.
When designing a garden or small area, it is important to give ample consideration to the level of accessibility. We must keep in mind that some people have restricted movement or use wheelchairs. They must be able to enter and use garden area with as much ease and safety as possible.
If there are no able-bodied adults willing to volunteer, these same types of activities can be carried out by seniors and younger children. We must not neglect these groups because they can do as much as or more than an able-bodied adult.
When gardening for recreation or to maintain one’s health, mobility is not a key requirement but would still be useful. Many people can work on hands and knees, use simple hand tools, and can wheelbarrow a few loads of garden waste or soil. They can use the same principles of mobility skills with heavy duty tools and equipment.
The exact activities that someone may or may not be able to perform will vary from person to person depending on their specific abilities, but here are some general principles to use to identify possible limitations.
Since everyone with restricted movement or in a wheelchair could probably manage a few of these ideas, they should always be given the opportunity to join in!
You can get a more complete overview of personal mobility skills and list of appropriate activities to assess an individual’s capacity for gardening by reading the PMA Community Gardening booklet at [http://www.communitygardeningcanada.org].
To provide an opportunity for people of all abilities to contribute in the garden, involve disabled and able bodied people equally in all aspects of the garden, while also taking into consideration the complex needs of disabled gardeners, PMA also publishes the manual, Tools for Accessibility and Inclusion in Community Gardens. This book is intended to assist community gardeners, volunteers and their clients in learning to use practical, inexpensive, easy-to-understand strategies for putting together an accessible and inclusive garden. In addition to indoor and outdoor accessibility strategies, accessible gardening design ideas and tips are also included. It is available on the web at [http://www.communitygardeningcanada.org].

Space exploration has been an important part of human history, and it began over 60 years ago. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into space, which marked the beginning of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. In response, the U.S. government established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 to lead American space exploration.

The first successful human spaceflight was the flight of Yuri Gagarin aboard the spacecraft Vostok 1 in 1961. This marked the beginning of human spaceflight and also demonstrated that it was possible to control a spacecraft in orbit.

In 1969, the United States succeeded in putting a man on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission, landing Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon's surface and planting the American flag. The moon landing marked a significant achievement in human history and inspired future space exploration.

Over the years, NASA has made numerous achievements in space exploration, including:

1. Mercury Program - NASA launched the first American astronauts into space between 1961 and 1963.

2. Gemini Program - NASA launched the first successful multiple astronaut space missions between 1965 and 1966.

3. Apollo Program - This program led to the first human landing on the moon, with the moon landing taking place between 1969 and 1972.

4. Skylab Program - This program was a series of six manned missions to the Skylab space station from 1973 to 1974.

5. Space Shuttle Program - The Space Shuttle Program was a series of space missions from 1981 to 2011 that used reusable spacecraft to launch and bring back payloads into space.

6. Mars Exploration Program - NASA has been exploring Mars with missions such as Viking 1, which landed in 1976, and Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in 2004, and most recently the Perseverance rover in 2021.

Overall, space exploration has been a significant milestone in human history, and future missions are expected to continue to push the boundaries of space exploration and explore beyond our own solar system.

Whether you have the ambition to one day be one of these professionals or want to pursue a career in mental health, there are many different jobs in psychology to choose from. A career in psychology can bring great variety, flexibility, and purpose into your life.
As a psychology major, you might be wondering about the differences between psychology and psychiatry. You may want to understand these two careers. Learning what each has to offer and understanding their differences, both in practice and educational preparation can help you find the right career path for you.
As with almost all careers, the first question you have to ask yourself is “what do I want to do?” It can be difficult to define exactly what you want to do as a career in psychology, but knowing your interests may help you narrow down your choices. So for the purpose of this article, we’ll offer you an overview of psychology and what each option within this field has to offer.
We’ll start off by defining a few of the terms in the field of psychology and psychiatry to be sure we’re talking about the same thing. Psychologists and psychiatrists study how people think, feel and behave, and provide therapeutic treatment.
Psychology
Psychology is defined as the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena and their connection to mental processes. Psychologists study mental processes and human behavior. Within this field, there is also behavioral psychology and counseling, but you’ll find more about those later.
Psychiatry
Psychiatrists are licensed medical doctors who study and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists treat mental health issues as medical illnesses, similar to the way that an internist or gastroenterologist treat physical conditions. Unlike psychologists, psychiatrists can prescribe drugs for mental health treatment as well as other types of psychiatric therapy.
Do You Need a Psychology or Psychiatry Degree?
Both a psychology degree and a psychiatry degree require students to complete a series of post-secondary studies before moving on to specialty professional degrees. In order to help them build a better foundation for their future careers, many psychology and psychiatry degrees include an undergraduate education. The undergraduate courses focus more on the science side of psychology and psychiatry. Most psychology bachelor’s degrees require completion of 30-40 undergraduate credit hours.
In addition to undergraduate coursework, you’ll also need to complete graduate studies, either an M.A. or a Ph.D. in the discipline you want to pursue. As you",505,4,2693

Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years, dating back to ancient India. The practice of meditation was originally introduced to help people focus their minds and improve their mental and emotional well-being. 

Early Hindu and Buddhist texts describe various forms of meditation, such as breath control, visualization, and reflection on spiritual themes. These practices were believed to help individuals connect with the divine and find inner peace.

In modern times, meditation has become increasingly popular, with many scientific studies demonstrating the many benefits of the practice. 

One of the primary benefits of meditation is stress reduction. Research has shown that regular meditation can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the body, leading to reduced anxiety and depression. Additionally, meditation has been shown to boost immune function, improve sleep quality, and enhance cognitive function.

Meditation can also help individuals develop greater self-awareness and emotional intelligence. By focusing on the present moment and developing mindfulness, individuals can learn to better understand their thoughts and feelings, and cultivate more positive and resilient emotions.

Overall, meditation has been shown to have a wide range of benefits, both for individual well-being and for society as a whole. Whether used as a spiritual practice, a form of relaxation, or simply to improve one's overall quality of life, meditation can be a valuable tool for anyone looking to cultivate inner peace and well-being.

This is very informative. Could you tell me more about the different types of meditation and their benefits?
Certainly! There are many different types of meditation, each with its own unique focus and benefits. Here are a few examples:

1. Mindfulness meditation: This type of meditation involves focusing on the present moment and paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without judgment. Mindfulness has been shown to have many benefits, including improved emotional regulation and reduced stress.

2. Loving-kindness meditation: This type of meditation involves cultivating feelings of kindness, compassion, and love towards oneself and others. Research has shown that practicing loving-kindness meditation can improve social connectedness, reduce negative emotions, and increase positive emotions.

3. Transcendental meditation: This type of meditation involves repeating a mantra or sound to achieve a state of deep relaxation and transcendence. Transcendental meditation has been shown to reduce stress, improve sleep, and enhance cognitive function.

4. Body scan meditation: This type of meditation involves focusing on different parts of the body and releasing tension and tightness. Body scan meditation has been shown to improve chronic pain, reduce anxiety, and enhance self-awareness.

For example, many scholars have questioned the link between animal agriculture and climate change, while others argue that it is ethically problematic to eat meat or to use animal products. This paper will critically assess the existing literature on the ethics of nutrition and provide an argument for why it is important to consider the ethical implications of what we eat. The paper will also analyze how different philosophical perspectives (such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics) have been applied to the topic of nutrition and argue for the need to adopt a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach to addressing ethical issues surrounding food consumption. 

The paper will begin by defining what ethical considerations in nutrition are and what kind of issues they can address. It will then outline the key arguments made by scholars on different ethical perspectives on nutrition, such as the arguments for and against eating meat, the ethical implications of factory farming, and the ethical implications of food waste. The paper will then analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these arguments and argue that a more holistic approach is needed to address the complex ethical issues surrounding food consumption. Specifically, the paper will argue that a virtue ethics approach is more appropriate for addressing ethical issues in nutrition, as it emphasizes the importance of individual character development and self-improvement. 

The paper will also explore the connections between nutrition and other important ethical issues, such as environmental ethics, animal welfare, and human rights. For example, the paper will analyze how different ethical principles, such as utilitarianism or deontology, are applied to these issues and argue for the importance of adopting a more interdisciplinary approach to addressing these complex ethical issues. 

The paper will also analyze the empirical evidence on different food systems and diets, such as plant-based diets, sustainable diets, or diets that incorporate traditional knowledge. It will argue that empirical evidence can help to inform ethical considerations and that a more interdisciplinary approach is needed to understand the full range of ethical implications of different food systems and diets. 

Finally, the paper will conclude by emphasizing the importance of incorporating ethical considerations into nutrition research, policy, and practice. It will argue that a more holistic and interdisciplinary approach is needed to ensure that ethical concerns are addressed in a comprehensive and thoughtful manner, and that this will ultimately lead to more sustainable and equitable food systems.

The paper evaluates the recent literature in the ethics of nutrition and the scholars' debates around the topic. It also supports its argument with recent empirical data, such as the environmental impact of livestock farming and the different food system options to address climate change.

# Introduction

Some “large” entities, in particular firms, are able to spend on research and development (R&D) on a per-unit-of-product basis, but few individual entrepreneurs, scientists, or engineers have the money and resources available to do the same on their own.

Thus, corporations, foundations, universities, research labs, and other research and development-oriented organizations typically work together, using the ingenuity and creativity of each of their members.

Economic incentives and rewards spur the financial motivation to do so. However, the motivation of private enterprises to make such efforts ultimately depends on the efficiency of the research and development process. Put another way, would such efforts save costs over the long run? Could one or more entities in any given field or industry adopt an organizational and resource management scheme that is more efficient than another?

Given the growth in R&D (specifically, in research) costs and the growing emphasis on productivity and efficiency (see, for example, my work on productivity statistics), these questions have become ever more pertinent over time. Of course, there is no “perfect” or “exact” answer to these questions. In practice, the effectiveness of a research and development effort will depend on factors such as the proximity and compatibility of the research laboratories involved and the geographic location of the product line.

In this course, you will learn the scientific basis for research and development and how to use it to interpret economic theory. You will study how economic researchers analyze and model the topics and issues that have been the subject of this course’s discussion over the years.

The functions that are the focus of this course, and the specific outcomes that they have had, have been driven by demands within an economic system. In part, the discussion in this course is about such a system and not about the context for it: the world in which it takes place. To appreciate why those functions occur, and what they are about, you will need to become familiar with the model in which they operate.

## Economists Study Economic Actions and Events

Like other social scientists, economists examine the relationships between social entities and the social changes that take place in human society.

The events or economic actions in any economic system, such as production, trading, consumption, and saving, are a primary focus of this course. Economists study the ways in which these events function. They investigate the interrelationships and interactions of firms and other economic agents, the structure of markets (including price patterns), and the consequences of economic growth and development.

Research is a fundamental component of any post-secondary academic program, but it is especially important in sociology. Unlike some other disciplines where experimental or survey research may take center stage, sociology research methods tend to employ a more hands-on approach, combining observation and qualitative analysis.
The following are some tips and techniques for how to prepare a good research proposal, identify good data sources, decide what kind of statistical analysis to perform, and synthesize your research results into a well-written paper.
In order to achieve your research goal, you will first need to create a research plan, which involves selecting a topic, conducting a literature review, and designing the research. All of these steps will help you move closer to an answer to your question or problem of interest.
Your research topic should be narrow and focused, dealing with a particular question, hypothesis, or problem.
Select a topic or problem that interests you and that is suited to the skills you bring to the research. A topic which is outside your area of expertise will likely be challenging to research or investigate.
If you are interested in a particular subject, but feel that there is not enough information available to fully answer your question or address your issue, try to identify why this is the case. You may be able to find a way to modify your question, to narrow your investigation, or to integrate data from other sources.
It is also important to be sensitive to ethical issues associated with your research, especially if you are studying people, organizations, or historical events. Attempt to identify what ethical issues are associated with your research.
You should also consider whether you need to get approval for your research from an ethics or institutional review board.
You can get a copy of a sample research proposal prepared by students in the Roy H. Park School of Communications here.
If you are not sure how to write a research question, you can use the library’s online guide to research questions.
The second step is to conduct a literature review. This involves systematically identifying and reviewing all relevant information available on your topic or problem, and looking for patterns or themes which emerge from your search results.
This process involves finding your way across the literature. When you want to find information on a topic, use the library’s online catalogs and subject databases to find books, journal articles, and other sources. Write down bibliographic information for each source that you find, then go to the online catalog or subject databases to do a more detailed search.
The results of your literature review should include the details of the most important findings.
Your literature review should also include a description",523,4,2844

A Conceptual, Interactive, and Inferential Genetics Course for a Limited Background Population

Abstract:

We created an asynchronous, inquiry-oriented genetics course designed for students who have varying levels of preparation in genetics and biology. To ensure that all of our students had a strong base for understanding genetics, our course started from basic molecular, cellular, and whole body interactions to obtain a robust conceptual basis for understanding the fundamental laws of heredity. To provide understanding of genetics beyond the content and mechanics of inheritance, we introduced inferential reasoning through explicit questioning, deductive logic, inference, and argumentation. We further incorporated interactive, problem-based activities to allow students to develop critical thinking and inferential reasoning skills by competing multiple-choice questions. Through these analyses, we concluded that our course successfully cultivates inferential reasoning skills in addition to conceptual mastery in a limited background audience.

# Project Overview

Introduction: To create our inferential genetics course, we observed the learning styles of students to improve the pedagogy of our course. Therefore, we asked the students what we could do to improve their experience in our course so that they would learn more genetics. We did this through learning style surveys and an end-of-course survey to see what we should change for our next iteration of the course.

Materials: We had the activities, student poll, and discussion forums using the QQ browser extension that students had access to throughout the course. The first 3 weeks of the course we had student polls to see how they thought the course was going as well as when they could predict which type of inheritance would be next. The next 3 weeks were guided in-class problems and activities. The final week and a half were a set of inferential activities and end-of-course surveys.

Design: We designed our course with this section in mind to assist students in producing inferential reasoning so that they could be better learners. We first introduced the fundamental bases of inheritance and then inferred and demonstrated why particular mechanisms are used.

On May 24, CNN broadcast ""Fashiolism: What do the Customers Want?"", a discussion with a distinguished panel of fashion industry heavyweights. The very first panelist was Antonio Marras, Creative Director at the Italian luxury brand, Marchesa. As a seasoned communicator, Marras took a particular interest in the impact the current health crisis may have on consumers' purchasing behaviour. At first, he was very much optimistic. In his opinion, we are currently going through a period of unprecedented opportunity.
From the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Marchesa Creative Director had advocated for brands to re-tool themselves and restart production once production restrictions have been lifted. Drawing from decades of experience in the industry, Marras went on to recommend an alternative model to fast fashion. One which values quality over quantity. ""Today, people are ready to spend more for an item which lasts longer, rather than simply following the latest trends"", he suggested.
Looking on the bright side, he believed that the new generation will be influenced by the recent health crisis and that they will place more importance on smart and strategic purchasing, not to mention in the importance of sustainability. Also a plus for less privileged customers, in his opinion, was the proliferation of streaming, for example on Netflix, which offers them access to whole libraries of movies, TV shows and music.
One member of the audience asked the panel if they had changed their minds. Five months on, what have they decided to do? What is the new normal? Who are your customers now?
The response from the Marchesa Creative Director was that the situation had forced them to look at themselves. The aim was to ensure that they were ready to renew without following a fast fashion approach, hence the need for a style that was less complex and appreciated for its lasting qualities and quality. He also argued that now, more than ever, people need to rethink what they like. A recent shift towards 'casual cool', which coincides with that dress code perfect for home working, is also giving rise to long-lasting trends.
With little doubt, our core business is to maintain a modus vivendi between business (brands) and consumers (customers), observing the rules of the market and social mores, but allowing consumers to express their opinions.
It seems that for the brand, our firm and our teams, this period, with the global lockdown, has taught us a valuable lesson. Well aware of the divergences of opinion between brands",524,4,2587

The modern university has developed as a kind of economic entity, with little accountability to the public. So I’m extremely excited by two proposals I’ve recently learned about that are going to counter that trend. Both the University of East London (UEL) and The Modern Philosophical Society are developing alternative programs for teaching philosophy that have the potential to set an important precedent. In this post, I’ll explain why.
At the end of the 20th century, universities expanded the number of majors with little accountability to students and the public. The humanities were once a valuable investment in a liberal democratic society. However, the humanities were still tied to the economic and political interests of the state. The decline of industrial production in Western economies, the retreat of the state from an active role in society, and the rise of the neoliberal ideology all contributed to the economic decline of the humanities. Universities found themselves turning to alternative sources of funding, and one of the most successful has been the private patron, especially private corporations.
Much of university scholarship since the Second World War has been financed by the state, the military-industrial complex, or private corporations. In most cases, universities are subsidized by or paid by those corporations that benefit from their research. The rise of entrepreneurial universities and the growth of knowledge in private hands have had a great deal of negative impacts on the quality of scholarly work. This model of university is rapidly coming to an end. One casualty of these developments is universities increasingly subsidize their administrative infrastructure through technological development. This, in turn, undermines the focus on teaching. The result is a decline in the quality of undergraduate education. The crisis of the undergraduate program is not an isolated case. In a similar fashion, there has been a great decrease in the supply of graduate students and the number of prizes awarded for scholarly work.
One of the most critical areas of higher education has been the development of a better understanding of the mental processes that underpin the ways that we reason, think, and learn. In 2011, the UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics reviewed the future of bioethics education and came to a conclusion that merits repeating today. The essential question for bioethics education is the following:
Is bioethics being taught in a way that is academically rigorous but also publicly relevant, inclusive and stimulating? The public currently lacks faith in the competence of the academic community, in bioethics, as a process of inquiry – or",516,4,2795

Philosophy can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Greece, Egypt, and China. The earliest known written philosophy dates back to around 600 BC in ancient India with the Vedas, which is a set of religious texts that explore the nature of existence and reality. 

In ancient Greece, philosophy was closely associated with the city of Athens. Philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle developed theories and concepts that would shape Western thought. Their ideas continue to influence Western culture and are still taught in universities today.

Throughout history, various philosophical movements have emerged, including the Hellenistic, Medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romantic periods. Each of these movements has contributed to the development of Western thought.

The Hellenistic period saw the rise of Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Cynicism, which were influential ethical and moral theories that emphasized self-reliance and the pursuit of happiness. The Medieval period was marked by the rise of Islamic philosophy and the Christian Neoplatonism, which explored the relationship between God and the world. The Renaissance, which began in the 14th century, saw a renewed interest in ancient philosophy and the revival of classical learning, which had a significant impact on the development of science, art, and literature. 

The Enlightenment period of the 18th century was marked by the spread of rationalism and empiricism, which emphasized the power of reason, scientific inquiry, and empirical observation. This period also saw the rise of liberalism, which focused on individual rights, democracy, and free markets. 

In the 19th century, the Romantic movement emerged, which emphasized emotion and imagination over reason and logic. This movement had a significant impact on literature, music, and the visual arts. 

In the 20th century, philosophy continued to evolve with the emergence of new movements such as existentialism, pragmatism, and postmodernism. These movements challenged traditional philosophical ideas and introduced new ways of thinking about the nature of reality and the self.

Overall, philosophy has played a significant role in the development of Western thought, contributing to the advancement of science, art, and society. Its history is marked by a diverse array of ideas, theories, and arguments that have shaped Western culture and continue to influence the world today.

It's interesting to see how philosophy has evolved over time. Do you think modern philosophy has any significant contributions to society or just repeats old ideas?

The Wrong Approach

Are you taking the wrong approach?

Many years ago, a visiting professor from Stanford University told me that 70% of the time spent by graduate students is not spent productively, i.e. that 70% of the time is wasted.

Great professors understand the quality of our academic programs, great research fields, and for whom we do math is not the main issue. However, we as researchers are mostly trained by poorly evaluating the quality of our work. We are raised to believe that work with high quality marks is good quality work. Unfortunately, that is not true. Our profession has been dominated by the principle of “pass the test” or “get the marks”. Admittedly, most researchers – including me -unconsciously believe that I will get what I measure (especially if I’ve pass the test in the past and have the formula to do it).

A good example of this psychological bias is Charles Darwin. He has been judged by many critics to not deserve to be called a scientist, due to his lack of empirical evidence. But, it wasn’t his lack of data, but rather his realization of a limitation of statistical data. The problem is that his contemporaries didn’t realize what would become a very powerful mathematical development (aka, using the Galilean group to study general mechanics).

In your discussion, include real-world examples of how neuroscience research has led to advancements in healthcare, technology, and the understanding of the human mind. Additionally, discuss the ethical implications of neuroscience and the potential risks and benefits of future developments in the field. Provide a thoughtful analysis of each key area of neuroscience and how they contribute to our understanding of the brain and human behavior. Finally, include references to relevant scholarly articles and research studies to support your discussion.

Neuroscience is the study of the brain and nervous system, including how they work and how they are affected by different factors such as drugs, disease, and environmental stimuli. This field of study has advanced rapidly over the last century, leading to numerous breakthroughs in healthcare, technology, and our understanding of the human mind.

The three key areas of neuroscience are:

1. Cognitive neuroscience: This area of neuroscience focuses on how the brain processes information and how it is represented in the mind. Cognitive neuroscience researchers use brain imaging techniques to study how different regions of the brain are involved in specific cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and language. Real-world examples of this include the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural correlates of decision-making and the development of brain-computer interfaces that enable people with paralysis to control prosthetic limbs.

2. Neurophysiology: This area of neuroscience focuses on the electrical activity of neurons and how it contributes to behavior. Neurophysiologists study the way neurons communicate with each other to regulate movement, emotions, and other cognitive processes. Real-world examples of this include the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, which involves implanting electrodes in the brain to stimulate specific regions and improve motor function.

3. Behavioral neuroscience: This area of neuroscience focuses on how the brain and nervous system influence behavior. Behavioral neuroscientists study how drugs, emotions, and other factors can affect behavior, including learning, memory, and social behavior. Real-world examples of this include the development of antidepressants that target specific neurotransmitters, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the discovery of the link between personality traits and the genes that control them.

While the potential benefits of neuroscience research are significant, there are also ethical implications to consider. As technology continues to advance and more sophisticated neuroimaging techniques become available, there are concerns about how this technology could be used to infringe on individual privacy or conduct illegal activities. There are also concerns",536,4,2982

What are the Benefits of Dancing?
Every time you dance, you are going to burn calories. Calories are what make you gain weight. When you burn calories, you lose weight. This is because weight is a combination of fat and muscle. In order to lose weight, you have to burn more calories than you consume.
There are a few ways that you can create the conditions to help with your weight loss.
First, you have to reduce the calorie intake. Reduce or cut out junk food. Replace the junk food with something much healthier. If you cut out junk food, you could very well lose weight.
Second, you have to exercise. When you dance, you burn lots of calories. Dancing has the ability to burn a lot of calories per minute. If you are worried about how to lose belly fat, doing the moves and steps of Latin dancing will help.
If you are watching the local news on TV, you can watch it while practicing some steps. If you do this, you can actually receive benefits. For example, you would be exercising. The news is not going to eat away at your television set. Make sure you pay close attention to the people teaching you how to do the steps correctly.
Getting rid of stress will help a lot. Dance like there is no tomorrow. After all, dancing is a fun activity. You will not burn many calories by dancing while sitting on a chair. You will burn lots of calories if you dance continuously. When you stop dancing, make sure that you do not walk around in front of the mirror.
Sometimes, this could be considered stressful. But, you are not walking around in front of the mirror because you want to show off your “beautiful” body. You want to move to the music. Give your body a workout.
Another reason why dancing is a great way to get rid of stress is because the music will be relaxing. The beats that dance music makes can help the brain calm down. Therefore, it will be harder to find time to feel stressed.

Weather conditions are determined by the micro-meteorological conditions like the heat exchange in the air over the earth’s surface, temperature, humidity, wind and the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. When there are meteorological conditions which can change the amount of solar radiation, then there will be some changes in the climate.
There are a number of technologies which use to understand the meteorological conditions. Radiation and temperature sensors are commonly used in such equipments to measure the amount of radiation absorbed by the earth. However, these devices are not very accurate in calculating changes in radiation or temperature in the atmosphere. This makes it difficult to measure the conditions accurately. Read more about Accurate Meteorology System.
The use of IR technology in the Accurate Meteorology System has come up as a solution for this. It uses infrared rays for measuring the radiation absorption rate in the atmosphere. They are also known as infrared lamps which are used for this. IR lamps are used for these purposes because the amount of energy absorbed by an object is directly proportional to the amount of radiation that passes through it.
Infrared sensors are used in sensors for temperature and humidity. The sensors are connected to a computer and the readings are displayed on the monitor. The measurement is done by measuring the temperature in the air by measuring the temperature of the sun’s rays. The system shows the difference between the temperature of the sun and the temperature of the air by comparing the same values in the air and the sun.
The Accurate Meteorology System has the capability to measure temperatures in the air at different times of the day and even during the night. This way, you can get accurate data on the climate. The sensors are mounted on a sensor board and are connected to the computer by a set of cables. The computer is programmed with the proper algorithms to analyze the data and display the results on the monitor.
This system is used in a number of different applications. It is commonly used in weather stations for forecasting and monitoring the weather conditions. It is also used in air traffic controllers to ensure that air traffic is controlled properly. It has become popular in industrial fields also.",431,4,2374

However, the history of cryptography extends beyond the use of modern computers. Today it's common to see this ancient method come together with your phone's screen to create an exciting new form of security. There are thousands of new ways to preserve your security, but those who aren't tech-inclined may not be able to enjoy some of these methods. Fortunately, Torp is here to help.

## The安全隐患

Most phones today are equipped with fingerprint sensors to quicken the login process. However, biometric scanning isn't foolproof; it's vulnerable to brute force attacks. Those with means or patience can gain unauthorized access to your device. Even worse, some attacks such as ""Pin Palming"" could steal the code even before it's acquired by a brute force attack.

## The Solution

The compromised fingerprint information can be easily converted into a password by using a simple trick; using a for loop to get the value of each key-press and then storing the time of each keypress in order to create a sequence of press counts. The password can then be created by simply concatenating the time-stamps of each key-press. With practice, the app has been able to generate 100+ digit passwords and authenticate multiple times in under 10 seconds.

## The Implementation

The implementation was done in Python. The script first detects if the device is a phone. If it's a phone, it locks the screen then presses the home button 3 times. After waiting 1.2 seconds, the screen is unlocked then waits for 1.7 seconds to acquire the fingerprint sensor data. The script then waits for 5 seconds to log in then repeats the process from the beginning. In this way, 20 million different passwords can be generated in 7.7 seconds. For more information about the script, refer to the source code.

This method of creating passwords could be applied to all future technology, especially the voice recognition technology that's coming out with Voice ID in iOS 15. With this newfound access to various ways of creating passwords, it's never been easier to stay anonymous.",477,4,2224

Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them. It is the foundation of many other sciences and provides the basis for understanding the behavior of the universe. 

At its core, physics deals with the laws of nature and the principles that govern how the universe works. It seeks to explain why things behave the way they do and how they will behave in the future. 

Physicists observe and measure the behavior of objects and use mathematical models to understand and predict how they will interact. They use tools such as microscopes, telescopes, and accelerometers to gather data and test their theories. 

Physics has numerous practical applications in our daily lives. For example, it helps us understand how electricity works, which allows us to use appliances like televisions, computers, and refrigerators. It also helps us understand how motion, force, and gravity affect the world around us. 
 

In conclusion, physics plays a crucial role in our understanding of the world around us. By studying and applying the laws of nature, we can improve our lives and make informed decisions about the future.

Can you give me an example of how physics is used in everyday life?

Sure, there are many examples of how physics is used in everyday life. One example is the use of thermodynamics in designing and manufacturing appliances. For instance, refrigerators, air conditioners, and freezers use thermodynamics to regulate the temperature inside them. The cooling and heating mechanisms of these appliances are designed to efficiently transfer heat from one area to another, ensuring that the temperature inside remains constant.

Another example is the use of physics in transportation. Cars, airplanes, and trains all rely on the principles of mechanics to move people and goods from one place to another. Engineers use physics to design the engines and other components of these vehicles, ensuring that they are efficient, reliable, and safe to use. 

Finally, physics is also used in medical technology, such as CT scans, MRI machines, and ultrasounds, which use principles of electromagnetics to create images of the body's internal structure. This helps doctors diagnose and treat various medical conditions. 

These are just a few examples of how physics is used in everyday life.

How do engineers apply the principles of mechanics in designing different types of transportation vehicles? Can you give me more details about it?

Engineers apply the principles of mechanics to design different types of transportation vehicles in several ways. Here are some examples:

Amy Mather, Fife and Tayside, Scotland.

#### Abstract

Climate change is arguably one of the most important issues facing the world today. As such, those who study it are not only challenged to provide evidence to support decisions to be taken, but also their own interpretation of that evidence. The interface between humans and the atmospheric system should result in long term concerns about personal well-being and that of society. Research into the climatological interactions of the atmosphere with humans is rich in applications, from predictions of health to food security. Yet in an age of increasing economic crisis it is easy to overlook the fact that current climate change research by academics is not just about the science, but also its value to society. In this paper, I am particularly concerned about how this value is not always accurately illustrated in presentations and discussion. For example, in a public lecture on weather forecasting research, I was asked “Why are you wasting time with these very weather pattern prediction experiments when it’s the extreme events that kill you?” I was also asked “why is forecasting research a societal priority?” I briefly describe two policy decisions, both of which have been demonstrated to be extremely costly and have required the mitigation of climate change science, and discuss whether this is acceptable. I briefly review some of the tools that have been demonstrated to illustrate value, such as  “impact stories”, the basics of which can be seen through three examples. I conclude by suggesting that there are a number of approaches available, which can achieve the same goals in terms of societal value, and yet have the necessary appeal to a wide public audience.

1777,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," indicate that one of the biggest obstacles to making more human-like artificial intelligence is the algorithmic implementation of a comprehensive model of human thought. While key areas of cognitive psychology have seen advances towards such a model, recent research is showing potential benefits to using the idea of “emergent behavior” to help fill in the gaps. While understanding emergent behavior has been a part of natural sciences for a long time (that is, understanding that physical systems can produce complex behavior that cannot be simplified to the interactions of its individual parts), in recent decades the term has also been used to describe how complex systems change when their structure and interactions with other systems change.
The more of the world there is, the more interesting your problems become, as you can build all sorts of increasingly complex relationships. Maybe you even end up in a mass of mutually interacting self-organizing things that allows many of the parts to get done in an optimal way. I thought something like this was happening with my workflow, in that I had a set of tasks (ie “The Ones I Haven’t Completed On Time”), and then I had a set of todo lists, and then I had a set of folders with relatively specific targets (and special lists for files and websites that need more careful attention), and one large list of generally achievable short term tasks, and so on. In theory, as long as I stayed on top of these lists, everything would get done on time, and then I could focus on things that took a bit longer to finish. Everything makes sense, until it doesn’t.
Either your notes are nested, or not. Either you want to keep your most interesting, on-going tasks as shallow as possible, or you want to organize your todos as deep as possible. Or you want to do both. How does this ever work? The answer is less critical than it seems. If you want to have structured information, but never want to confuse it too much, you can find a way to keep track of ideas in a way that works well for you. For me, some combination of hierarchical lists (eg an interesting random thing might be another todo that has to be written up afterwards), tag systems (sometimes, putting all the tasks about writing a pop music song in one list is better than managing them individually), and “open” projects (projects that have no end point – I do this with a bunch of apps I write, and if I want to get a different version on a more condensed device, I start a new one, rather than going back and changing a",530,4,2541

One day, John decided that he needed to make a change. He wanted to find a way to manage his stress better and find inner peace. That's when he heard about meditation. He decided to give it a try, and he signed up for a meditation class.

The first day, John found it very difficult to quiet his mind. He couldn't focus on anything, and his thoughts were constantly racing around his mind. He felt like he was missing out on something, and he couldn't help but feel like a failure.

As time went on, however, John found that meditation was making a significant difference in his life. He started to feel more calm and collected, and he was able to handle stressful situations with more ease. He began to realize that he could control his thoughts and emotions, and he felt like he was finally taking control of his life.

Now, John is a true believer in the power of meditation. He practices meditation every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. He feels like he's able to handle any situation with more clarity and calmness than ever before. 

In conclusion, meditation is an excellent way to find inner peace and manage stress better. By giving it a try, John was able to transform his life for the better, and now he's a true advocate for meditation.

It's amazing how meditation can change someone's life. I wish I could find the time to meditate more often. Do you have any tips for someone who's just starting out? Certainly! Here are some tips for starting a meditation practice:

1. Start small: Begin by setting aside just a few minutes each day to meditate. Consistency is key, so pick a time that works for you and stick with it.

2. Find a quiet space: Choose a quiet and comfortable space where you won't be distracted or disturbed while you meditate.

3. Focus on your breath: Concentrate on your breathing and allow yourself to let go of any distracting thoughts.

4. Use a guided meditation: If you're new to meditation, using a guided meditation can help you stay focused and provide structure to your practice.

5. Be patient and kind to yourself: Meditation is a practice, and it takes time to develop. Be patient with yourself and don't get discouraged",518,4,2400

It is essential to raise awareness among Singaporeans about the importance of robotics in our daily lives, and to expose them to the opportunities offered by the sector.

Robotics is increasingly being used in many areas of life, including healthcare, logistics, transportation, and education. Singapore has a thriving robotics ecosystem, with a wide range of companies offering products and services in the field. From simple robots that perform household chores, to highly sophisticated surgical robots, robotics has become an integral part of modern life.

In Singapore, robotics is being used in healthcare to enhance the quality of care for patients. Robotic surgical systems, such as the Da Vinci system, are used to perform complex surgeries with precision and accuracy, reducing the risk of complications and improving recovery times. Robotics is also being used in logistics, where autonomous vehicles are being developed for last-mile delivery and inventory management. In addition, robotics is being used in education to enhance learning experiences and improve outcomes for students.

Despite the importance of robotics, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in order for the sector to fully realize its potential in Singapore. One of the key challenges is the shortage of skilled workers who are able to work in the field. This is a global challenge, and Singapore is not immune to it. To address this, there is a need to focus on training and developing young Singaporeans in the field of robotics, and to attract and retain skilled workers from other countries.

In conclusion, the cultural significance of robotics in Singapore lies in its potential to transform society in numerous ways, and to improve the quality of life for citizens. The challenges faced by the sector need to be addressed, but there is no denying that the future is bright for robotics in Singapore. As the country continues to invest in and support the development of the sector, we can look forward to a future where robotics plays an even greater role in shaping the world we live in.

Thanks for the detailed report on the cultural significance of robotics in Singapore. Could you add some information on how robotics is being used in the entertainment industry? I am curious to know how it could add value to this sector.

Certainly! The entertainment industry is another area where robotics is being used to enhance the customer experience and deliver new and innovative experiences. Robotics is being used in theme parks, museums, and other attractions to create interactive exhibits and experiences that engage and captivate visitors.

Astrology and astronomy have many similarities; they both aim to study and understand the universe, but astrologers and astronomers use different methods. Astrologers look at the positions of the planets and stars, while astronomers measure and analyze the interactions between them.

Astrology is the study of how the positions of celestial bodies, including the sun, moon, planets and stars, can influence the personality and behavior of individuals. Astrology originated in ancient Egypt and has since been used for centuries to help people understand themselves, their relationships and the world around them. Astrology uses the positions of the planets and stars at the time of birth to create a personal chart that reveals a person’s characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. The chart is then used to interpret the individual’s life path and guide them in making decisions.

In fact, today, the changes in climate are among the most recognized hot-button issues the world faces, and are very significant to the well being of the planet. Changes to climate, whether due to over development, pollution, or the sun itself, can be very harmful to our planet, and so by being aware of how these changes occur and how they can be possibly avoided, hopefully everyone can look at their climate change activities with a critical eye.
One important concept that needs to be understood is the Holocene Epoch, and what occurred during the beginning of the Holocene. During this time, the Earth started to experience and natural environment and, with the fall of the planets glaciers, and the rise of its temperature, the world changed forever. In fact, all of the rich forests and savanna land found in North America today were not even capable of growing during this time, which is why, when Europeans came to North America, the lands they encountered were unable to sustain them in the way that most people expected.
The end of the climate the Holocene and the beginning of the anthropocene became very dramatic. As a direct result of the spread of agriculture, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increased significantly. Not only that, but the type of agriculture itself did not leave a great amount of carbon storage. In other words, with all of the fall off in canopy density and leaves, the amount of carbon that got emitted increased dramatically. Since agriculture began, humans have been involved in a never ending progression towards more destructive agricultural practices. As a result of this, and the rampant release of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere, the Holocene is considered to have begun, and the anthropocene (the new geological epoch of our age) began.
Because of the numerous industrialization that has occurred over the past several years, the atmosphere that humans now live in has to some extent, become quite unstable. So, it is important to talk about how human engineering has not only lead to the anthropocene, but also how it has affected the lands that we live in, and the indigenous people of the lands that the present day humans reside. So far, it is becoming more clear that the climate changes that we create are causing serious harm to the flora and fauna on the planet, and these plants and animals are finding it hard to accommodate to the changes in the climate.

# Introduction

Quantum mechanics is a physical theory describing the properties and behaviour of particles, including electrons, atoms and photons at the atomic scale. First proposed by physicist Max Planck, the theory has since evolved to describe the fundamental nature of reality.

Modern physics is most closely associated with the quantum mechanics theory.

# What is Quantum Mechanics?

Quantum mechanics is a physical theory for describing the properties and behaviour of particles at very small scales (e.g. electrons, atoms, photons, and other elementary particles). The theory is built on two fundamental principles: quantum superposition and wave-particle duality.

## Quantum Superposition

Quantum superposition is the key fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. It refers to the idea that all possible states of a quantum system can be added together mathematically, and that the resulting sum will give a correct description of the system's state.

The process of superposition describes how particles in quantum mechanics exist in multiple states simultaneously. This is quite different from classical mechanics, which assumes particles exist in a single, discrete state. Superposition is also what makes quantum mechanics more predictable and accurate than classical physics. This principle is also known as the ""wave-particle duality,"" which refers to the fact that quantum systems exhibit both wave-like and particle-like characteristics.

Mathematically, a quantum system can be described by a wave function Ψ(x) = Aψ(x), where A is a normalization constant and ψ(x) is a quantum state of a particle, such as an electron.

The superposition principle of quantum mechanics states that a physical system in a given quantum state can be described as the superposition of other quantum states. This is also referred to as the principle of entanglement.

A single particle can be described by a wave function Ψ(x,t) that evolves in time according to the Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation describes how a quantum system changes over time.

The Schrödinger equation is one of the most important equations in quantum mechanics. It describes how the wave function of a quantum system changes over time, and it is the foundation of many of the theories and equations used in quantum mechanics.

# Superposition

One of the main principles of quantum mechanics is superposition, which describes the ability of particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This is quite different from classical mechanics, where particles exist in a single, discrete state.

This principle also gives rise to quantum entanglement, where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state",517,4,2726

1786,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are based on distributed algorithms. When designing distributed systems the goal is usually to maximize the performance of the algorithm which executes the algorithms. However, unlike serial implementations, it is not clear what performance properties the distributed system should optimize. The only known performance criteria for distributed algorithm is the time (seconds) and memory (bytes) required to execute an algorithm on a number of computers which communicate over a communication network. The emphasis on purely numerical performance criteria is so extreme that its impact on performance is not clear. In this paper we propose a new performance criteria for distributed systems based on time and communication cost while computing the final result of an algorithm. We call it {\em (rough) communication complexity}. Communication complexity is similar to the computational complexity of the associated {\em (rough) communication problem} which uses two players communicating with each other over a one-way communication network and the initial player failing to meet the requested communication if the final player fails. The primary contribution of this paper is to show how existing algorithms for distributed systems can be adapted to a more meaningful performance metric. A good distributed algorithm can have extremely poor communication complexity and a poor distributed algorithm can have excellent communication complexity. The paper proposes a framework in which we define communication complexity as a performance criteria. We propose a survey of distributed algorithms which compute the {\em aggregation} of random distributed data on a distributed system of {\em num} (i.e., number of computers) such that each computer stores an {\em x[i]} in {\em [0,1)} for the i$^{th}$ indexed data in the random data. The aggregation operation involves some function $f$ acting on {\em x[i]} (i=1,2,...,n). The problem of computing the aggregate {\em f(x[1])+f(x[2])+...+f(x[n])} from the individual contributions of the i's is the {\em AGGREGATION} problem. The problem of distributing the function {\em f} and inputs in {\em x[1]} to the i's over {\em num} computers and computing the function $f(x[1])+f(x[2])+...+f(x[n])$ is the {\em DISTRIBUTION} problem. The INTERCHANGE problem is similar to the AGGREGATION problem with the crucial difference that the number of computers is fixed to {\em num} and hence one cannot use the partition {\em num} = {\em C1+C2+...+Cn} so as to minimize the communication between the computers.",565,4,2543

A picture emerged of you when you was the leader of Talking Heads and hence had a certain effect on the kind of musicians you work with since. Is that how you see it, or is it just a coincidence that most of the musicians you worked with in that period were very into the experimental side of music?
I think it's something I couldn't be aware of at the time. But you're certainly right that I have always attracted people who are into music rather than pop music - those who look to ideas rather than entertainment. We kept with Talking Heads until the early 90s.
And speaking of pop music, isn't a frustrating experience to have someone recording your score to a pop film with pop stars like Rihanna and Coldplay?
I suppose it might be frustrating. That's the drawback of doing your own scores nowadays, the temptation to let the music take on a life of its own and as a result, effectively become that of the film. Whether it is frustrating is for others to judge.
Are there any bad experiences where you lose control of the music as it starts to take a life of its own? What did you do in those situations?
Have you heard the soundtracks Coldplay or Rihanna made?
What does it sound like?
It doesn't. It sounds more like Icelandic pop music.
Ah, I see. Well, that's the flaw in the record industry. It should be more market driven, but it's not. You could have an amazing version of some of those songs, you just need a more professional. They don't have to be of the right sound - it could be an alternative production which isn't in line with the film itself. That's always worked very well with and Bjork with the Sugarcubes - her songs changed a lot over the course of the movie and they wouldn't have if they were doing the soundtracks.
Do you know what I mean? I mean, Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop is a Waterfall' at the beginning of the video of the same name, it's so different to the video itself. If you wanted to sing along, you'd be screwed. There's a mismatch.

The expectation that we will gain this knowledge through a perpetual cycle of meaningful retrospection and constant inner-search, having faith in the universe and the awareness of God, enables us to be in direct contact with the universal information processing, energy of the future and universe itself.
Quantum mechanics has attracted many curious scientists who have conducted experiments using these results. The analysis conducted by quantum physicists and other scientists of the quantum world revealed remarkable data that has only become useful and comprehensible in recent decades. The ability to analyse and reduce complicated functions and phenomena has provided researchers with a method of measuring and categorizing millions of data through the mysterious and unintelligible information processing system.
This new technology of quantum mechanics has become a popular topic not only in scientific publications but also in popular culture. Like precursors, the consciousness of the founders of this technology has captured the attention of many people. While exploring quantum computers, individuals realize that this new technology is far more powerful and advanced than any technology ever developed on the planet Earth. This has enabled researchers to conduct quantum computation of the infinite universe and understand the living universe and give an explanation of life itself.
How do we understand the infinite universe? Is the universe was created to force an equilibrium in the system? What makes this universe unique in this vast universe? How did we get into this world, which is not going to end? These questions have been answered through theoretical discoveries from quantum physicists. In order to answer questions, our goal must be to analyse and understand the concepts of quantum mechanics. Now, what is quantum physics and the universe?
Scientists assume that physical properties in the universe follow a special system of rules. They discovered that every element in the universe can be described using a set of parameters that define its position, speed and size. This kind of property is known as physical quantity. Quantum mechanics apply to this process. You could liken these processes to computer processing because they process operations and provide results. The general formula for computers is commonly known as program operations. The advantage of having a program is that it can run both on the computer and directly on the computer. As it was demonstrated, we can apply that to our understanding of the universe.
The ability to explain the role and order in this universe indicates that each character has an individual position. Another theory suggests that the reason for our time, personal space, personality and character, are based on the difference in their properties. This may not seem scientific and rational",523,4,2987
1792,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," seems pretty clear: we travel because we want to explore, experiment, and have new experiences, and technology makes those things easier. But, at some point, we have to log off and be present with whoever or whatever we’re with. We asked fellow travelers and photographers for tips on how to balance travel and technology—and the answers were unexpected. Here’s what they had to say.
As soon as we get off the plane, the most important thing is getting some rest. Otherwise, when you’re alone in an unfamiliar city, you feel more exposed and vulnerable. I also recommend turning off your smartphone as soon as you get in the taxi, because sometimes I have been chased by girls that want to show you a video or post about you in social media, and that distracts you from what you want to discover. Then on Instagram, I like the Explore page; it shows you recent pictures that fit into the tag you put in. I check it when I go to a new place for the first time. After three days, I take a break to get off the internet and just live in the city. If you are traveling with a group, definitely take turns using Instagram, so it doesn’t interfere with having fun.
Work or travel? On the road, you’re never really sure about where you’re going, so you need to be smart in your planning. The smartest way to do that is to bring a zero0connect Sim Card and simply connect to their 2G, 3G, and 4G networks in 190 countries. The network is the biggest in Europe and South America, and it lets you switch to whatever you need for optimal speed and coverage based on the location and plan you’re using. On Instagram, I always go “On Tour” and look up the location before going out. I’ve also learned that it’s the best tool for “researching” the local cultural differences so I won’t be disrespectful by “accidentally” doing the wrong thing. Always be sure to look for public transport details to avoid getting lost and never go on a road trip without a GPS.
I recently went to the South of Africa to photograph marine life. I took a boat with my assistant to go to see the sardine run in South Africa. After months of planning, finally, the day came.

Once upon a time, in the early 20th century, the world of cinema began with the invention of the motion picture camera by Thomas Edison. Cinema quickly spread across Europe and Asia, bringing new ways of storytelling to audiences all over the world.

In Italy, the first theaters were opened in the early 1900s, showing silent films with Italian-language dialogues and songs. One of the most famous Italian film companies, Cinema Paradiso, was established in the 1930s and quickly became a major player in the Italian film industry. They produced many classic Italian films, such as ""Il Signore delle AnFIELD FRANCEGi"" and ""La Dolce Vita"".

In Hindi-speaking countries, the first theaters were also opened in the early 20th century, showing Indian films with Hindi-language dialogues. One of the most famous Hindi film companies, Bollywood, was established in the 1940s and quickly became a major player in the Indian film industry. They produced many classic Hindi films, such as ""Sholay"" and ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"".

In the 1940s and 1950s, the first blockbuster films were produced in Hollywood, such as ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Casablanca"". These films inspired filmmakers in both Italy and Hindi-speaking countries to create larger, more extravagant films.

In the 1960s, the rise of youth culture and rock and roll music had a significant impact on the film industry, as filmmakers sought to appeal to younger audiences with films such as ""The Beatles: A Hard Day's Night"" and ""La Dolce Vita"".

In the 1970s, the Indian film industry produced many classic films, such as ""Sholay"" and ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"". The films of director Satyajit Ray became widely recognized around the world, with the film ""Pather Panchali"" winning international acclaim and an Academy Award nomination.

In the 1980s and 1990s, filmmakers in both Italy and Hindi-speaking countries experimented with new forms of storytelling, with films such as ""The Godfather"" and ""Slumdog Million",460,4,2189

There is no doubt the world has become a better place thanks to the transformative power of technology. Unfortunately, not every transformation has improved our lives. Not every advancement in the domain of technology is good for the planet.
If we use technology to offer cleaner and more sustainable energy for everyone, we can really improve the quality of life all over the world. With technology, a great deal of pollutants can be eliminated from the energy sources and transport systems around the globe. One of the most important developments in the field of technology is electric vehicles.
They reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Electric vehicles emit very little greenhouse gases. According to The Guardian, they emit 26 to 27 times less than the average car. This means electric vehicles have the potential to help cut our carbon footprint significantly. However, not every electric vehicle offers the same level of environmental benefits. The environmental impact of e-vehicles can vary depending on how energy is produced.
So, as electric vehicles become more popular, it’s important to consider how energy is generated. For instance, replacing all gas-powered with electric vehicles would require up to 50 per cent of the electricity generation capacity. Furthermore, electric vehicles would have to be charged at peak demand times to offset the pollution produced by coal-fired generation.
It’s the same with solar panels. If these panels produce clean energy, but the energy is used for air conditioning, the overall effect is as bad as using a gas-powered vehicle.
Advancements in the field of technology have resulted in a safer environment
Electric vehicles are safer than internal combustion engine vehicles. Modern hybrids and all-electric vehicles have significant safety benefits compared to the traditional vehicles. For instance, most of the incidents caused by the traditional engine vehicles happen during the crash as passengers try to move to safety.
Internal combustion engine vehicles are being redesigned with heavier, stiffer bodies. In many cases, there is more glass in the vehicles because manufacturers believe their safety will increase by making them more visible. On the other hand, electric vehicles have no tailpipe, giving them a clear advantage in terms of visibility and overall safety.
Most of the safety benefits electric vehicles have over the traditional engines vehicles come from their batteries. They may pose a threat to the occupants in the event of a crash, but cars with gas tanks are often 10 times worse. Furthermore, the new technology uses carbon nanotubes to create high strength materials and better structures.

We are considered to be in a deep meditative state always – and so we teach our students this as a practice by pretending to be falling into sleep.

Hello from a transplanted American living in New Zealand who is very much into GIS, science, and data! Geology has never really been my field of study as it tends to be a discipline that is primarily done with the use of digital photography, handouts, field trips, and lots of slides. However, in the past five years or so, I have taken in much of the geology and mapping/analysing techniques that are available. Most of this has been more or less of a self-education, as I have never really had the chance to actually study geology in a formal sense. I have always enjoyed mapping, and since the field of GIS has always intrigued me, combining the two subjects have become very interesting to me.
I’d just like to pass on a short list of some geology-specific free books I am enjoying at the moment. I have a small home library of books, which are mostly out of date but are nevertheless a very good read for anyone. If you are looking for the latest information, it is probably still a good idea to use the university library as much as possible – they are much better and more up-to-date. These books do have some information useful for someone who isn’t looking to become a geologist (like myself), though. They do help to familiarise me with what goes on in the field, and also give a few ideas and tips to make the work process much easier. They are also, however, used as a guide to model certain phenomena that I want to replicate in a GIS, and also help me to overcome the difficulties I face while planning a field campaign. They can help you better plan your survey, too, and they are nice enough for bedtime reading, too.

When did CO2 start to have a climate effect?
""Over the past two decades global mean temperatures have not risen, despite continuing increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration.""
It is impossible to reconcile this statement with the actual observations and measurements. What is true is that the average change in global mean temperature over the last 20 years is very small, but so what? The point is that we have been measuring the temperature of the earth for over 100 years, and it has warmed. The time variable is the temperature. CO2 may or may not have a climate effect, but what these characters are saying is not true. What bothers me the most is the implied fraud, that a conclusion they want and are trying to build their argument on has happened, when there is no evidence of that.
Forget this because 100 years is insignificant and way too short for CO2 to do anything to the climate. More years are needed.

A popular and growing niche in the world of spirituality and faith, Greek mythology is actually a major component of the foundation of Western philosophy and culture. The origin of the Greeks is often traced back to mythology, and until today, we still see many of their motifs and stories becoming part of various facets of their art, literature, architecture, and culture. A good place to start with Greek mythology is by understanding their panoramic view of life. To this day, the scholars from the golden age of Greece are held in high regard. Much has been written on the gods, heroes, and myths from ancient times and the modern-day scholars are still heavily influenced by it.
Greek myths are often deemed to be children’s books, but it’s really a lot more than that. It represents one’s relationship with the unknown, and it helps them to grow. A good example of Greek myth that many of us have heard is the legend of Prometheus, an ancient Greek myth telling how humans, both men and women, are subject to a curse.
According to the myth, a certain tribe and its religious leaders are called upon to see a fallen star in the sky. To their surprise, they see that it’s actually a great, hollow ox that falls from the sky. The gods determine that in order to keep man alive, they would create fire for them, which meant that all three, the gods, humans, and women would share the responsibility in keeping man in the dark ages. According to Homer, Prometheus planned to sneak this knowledge to earth by the clever use of fire by he himself.
One evening, Zeus, who was the king and god of the gods, comes down from the sky to the earth to inspect what his subjects have done so far. To his surprise, he sees the light of fire in the sky. Zeus could not bear the sight of fire, as he deemed fire as the property of the gods and their reign. He then came down to earth to find out where this light came from. When he saw Prometheus, he accused him of stealing fire from him and in return, he put a tremendous price",528,4,2436

How do you calculate a material's dielectric constant?

A material's dielectric constant can be calculated from the equation

$$\epsilon = \frac {\epsilon_m \pm \sqrt {\epsilon_r^2 -1} } {\epsilon_r}$$

Here, $$\epsilon_r$$ represents the dielectric ratio, and is the ratio of the permittivity of a vacuum ($$\epsilon_0$$) to the permittivity of the material ($$\epsilon_m$$).

If $$\epsilon_r>1$$, the dielectric constant is positive (ie; the material is a polarizing substance). If $$\epsilon_r<1$$, the dielectric constant is negative (polarizing) and if $$\epsilon_r=1$$, the material is non-polarizing.

The symmetry or degree of symmetry of an electric field for a given arrangement of charges is defined by the degree to which the system can exhibit rotation. That is, if a charge distribution is symmetric, rotations by an integer number of 2π/integer can be introduced without altering the electrostatic field. So if the system of charges are symmetric about a centre, for example, an atom or point charge, the electric field has 360o rotational symmetry. A system with a point charge in the centre and a monopole surrounding it will have 180o rotational symmetry (point charge) and if the polarisation were arranged symmetrically, ie; two poles either side of the charge and a dipole (those showing positive and negative charges at either end of a dipole), the system would have 90o rotational symmetry.   The symmetry associated with multipole charges will be found by the square root of the symmetry associated with the corresponding monopole and dipole interactions.

What is the electric flux through an electric field lines?

When a continuous electric field exists, the flux is given by the gradient in electric field lines in the given direction of the flux. Of course, the field itself changes with location, and so does the gradient. The electric flux is given by the product of the electric field vector times the area vector (normal to the flux vector). So $$\phi=\vec{E}\times \vec{A}$$.

If A is a surface in the shape of a cube with side 1cm, how much electric flux pass",542,4,2243

# Macro-economics: Long-run economic growth

2016 November 7

Uncertainty represents an economic price. Liquidity trade-offs across risk preferences exist. Capitalism allows a profit and a profit motive for the owners and managers. The profit is a function of savings. Profit motive and constraints are a value system of capitalism. Capitalism allows for compounding of capital. The rate of increase of profit on equity capital is known as the capital-growth rate (or simply the growth rate).

For a long period of time the rate of increase in the rate of increase in per capita capital growth becomes more difficult to maintain. Since “leisure” has been limited, the number of hours worked becomes limited, and the opportunity for profit from the inefficient allocation of capital may be less likely. Higher human capital growth rates leads to higher human growth rates, with greater dependency, which eventually may diminish economic growth rates. In the long run, a relationship exists between labor productivity and the marginal product of capital.

## Economic Growth

Economic Growth includes several variables. 1) The level of per capita real GDP, usually expressed as a percentage over previous years. 2) The current rate of economic growth, expressed as a percentage change over the previous year. This number is also often referred to as the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. 3) The long-term trend line, also referred to as “economic growth”. This line looks at per capita growth for multiple years. For example, the graph below shows growth for 10 years. The line shows the average yearly increase in GDP over the 10-year time period. 4) The average growth per year, expressed as a percentage of GDP. This refers to the average percent change for all years in the period being measured. The longer the period you measure for, the more meaningful the figure becomes.

The investment of capital in economic development can be seen as a process of learning. The initial capital investment does not guarantee that higher level of production will occur. Capital growth depends upon learning. For example, consider growth in the use of scientific agriculture. In ancient times it is possible to view an increased supply of food from cultivation, but we do not see advances in yield. With increased research, new varieties of food crop are developed. New methods of improved cultivation are developed. These, along with increased agricultural knowledge, lead to a growing productivity of agriculture, leading to greater per capita output. Learning, both about capital and labor use, leads to economic growth. In the case of",504,4,2628

1810,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Is it a true source of knowledge or is it just a popular scence fiction that appeals to some mystical forces we don't understand yet? In certain aspects I agree with physicist Alan Wallace who argued that ""A method which claims to transcend subject and object, dogmas and contradictions, and transcend reasoning is not in fact a method at all. It is a religion whose teacher claims divine inspiration."" But things are not that simple.
As I already discussed several time in my posts in this blog, there are many ways of understanding this world, including science, mystical or otherwise. So science is not only limited to the sphere of knowledge derived from scientific research. Science in a very general sense means anything that serves as knowledge; for example art, history, religion, philosophy, etc. So science in a broader sense can be of any kind. What separates science from other disciplines in such a broad understanding is simply that it is not driven by personal or institutional agendas and any results that can be verified through comprehensive experimentation and objective measurement techniques is considered a valid source of knowledge. While science does take into account and remain connected to various spiritual and philosophical perspectives, these are seen as mere manifestations of the same underlying truth or reality, and not as independent spheres with unbridgeable gaps between them. Therefore, science is usually perceived as a cold, pragmatic tool and not as a divine revelation, an emotional outburst of colors.
Scientists commonly hold the view that ""The universe exists for no higher purpose than itself."" But this position ignores the fact that there is a notion of intelligent design in the world from where science finds its form and its organizing principles. The main difference between the empirical study of science and the scientific literature, art and philosophy is that science has a method and this method is characterized by a seemingly ruthless tendency to disrupt any and all cherished illusions, which includes the one of subjectivity of any human perception, sensation or feeling. So according to the fundamental principle of science, the objective knowledge of the world can never stem from an inner revelation by using any subjective means.
But this doesn't mean that science cannot seek objective knowledge about the world. Some philosophers like Wilhelm Dilthey thought that it is impossible for science to be grounded in subjectivity, but science is not dead-end of the road. Although science cannot provide us with a definitive conclusion about the meaning of life or the metaphysical dimensions of the cosmos, it can serve as a valuable source of knowledge about nature, life, and the universe. But as science develops and keeps penetrating into new unknown dimensions of reality, it",524,4,2843

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task over time without being explicitly programmed. This technology has revolutionized numerous industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, among others. Machine learning algorithms are widely used to predict future trends, make recommendations, and automate repetitive tasks, thus enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions that improve their bottom line.

However, beyond its practical applications, machine learning has significant cultural and social implications. On one hand, it has the potential to widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots, as it requires significant computing power and data access, which may be out of reach for many individuals and organizations. On the other hand, it has the potential to democratize access to data and knowledge, as machine learning algorithms can help people make sense of complex and unstructured data.

One of the most significant cultural implications of machine learning is its impact on job displacement. As machines become more adept at performing tasks traditionally done by humans, many jobs may become redundant. While this may lead to greater productivity and economic growth, it could also result in significant job losses and social unrest. Machine learning could also exacerbate existing biases and inequalities, as algorithms learn from historical data and may perpetuate discrimination if not designed carefully.

Another cultural implication of machine learning is its potential to blur the boundaries between humans and machines. As machine learning algorithms become more sophisticated, they may become more indistinguishable from humans, leading to ethical questions about what it means to be human in a world where machines are becoming increasingly intelligent.

In conclusion, while machine learning has significant cultural and social implications, its potential to revolutionize various industries and improve people's lives cannot be denied. As we continue to develop this technology, it is important to consider its impact on society and ensure that it is used in a way that benefits everyone, not just a select few.

Can you provide some examples of job displacement that could occur with the widespread adoption of machine learning?

Machine learning: it’s a term that has been getting a lot of attention lately, and for good reason. It’s an exciting field with the potential to revolutionize everything from healthcare to transportation. In this blog post, I’m going to explain why machine learning matters right now.

I’ll start by giving a brief overview of what machine learning is and why it’s becoming so important. I’ll then explain some of the exciting applications of machine learning, including medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and personalized marketing.

So, if you’re interested in learning more about machine learning, keep reading. I’m here to explain why it matters right now.

What is machine learning?

Before we dive into why machine learning matters, it’s important to understand what machine learning is.

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as recognizing images or generating text.

The key to machine learning is that it doesn’t require programmers to write explicit instructions for the computer to follow. Instead, it uses algorithms to learn from data and improve its performance over time.

Machine learning has been around for decades, but it’s only in recent years that it has become accessible to non-specialists. With the proliferation of big data and cloud computing, it’s now possible for anyone to apply machine learning to solve complex problems.

How is machine learning being used right now?

So, you might be wondering how machine learning is actually being used right now. There are a lot of exciting applications of machine learning, but here are three that I think are particularly interesting.

Machine learning in healthcare: With the help of machine learning algorithms, medical researchers are able to analyze vast amounts of data and identify new treatments for diseases. For example, machine learning can be used to analyze medical images and identify early signs of cancer.

Machine learning in self-driving cars: Machine learning is essential for the development of self-driving cars. These vehicles use a combination of sensors, cameras, and machine learning algorithms to navigate roads and avoid obstacles. With the help of machine learning, self-driving cars can improve their performance over time and become safer and more efficient.

Machine learning in marketing: Machine learning can be used to personalize marketing messages and improve the effectiveness of advertisements. By analyzing data on customer behavior and preferences, machine learning algorithms can be used to create more targeted and effective marketing campaigns.

So, as you can see, machine learning has a wide range of applications and is becoming increasingly important in many fields.

The technology business challenges have changed in recent years.
Patent infringement is down. The time to market is probably much longer than it used to be. Technology transfers are more complex. The number of products on the market and the names attached to the brands is enormous. It has all made it much harder to succeed at an early stage with a technology company.
Patents have become an important tool for protecting and growing a technology company but they have become much more complex than they used to be as well. Just as your company has changed, the technologies and innovations are more powerful than ever before and the courts and other enforcement tools that have been developed to help protect patents have been put to use in unprecedented ways. Few executives like to see his or her name in the newspaper with a judge’s ruling in a patent case. But there it is, time and time again.
The time to market in new products has extended, while new products that have been around for years often dominate the market and brand name recognition is key to long-term success. If one has a patent for a “thing” (a combination or an improvement), one needs not only to be fast but one must be far thinking as well. A patent must survive for 20 years. If the company survives, a patent may not.
Increasingly, emerging companies in emerging industries are partnering with or being bought by established companies who are usually willing to expend the resources and buy the time necessary to protect a winning brand. One has to look long and hard about how to position a product or technology for new markets. It is not always the obvious choice. (It is certainly difficult if there is a strong incumbent!) The strategy around technology commercialization is very complex and takes a great deal of organization and teamwork. I have even found that the technology is not always the most important consideration.
The law is another tool, but a broad legal education can sometimes be a distraction if one has no idea what success or failure might look like and there is no real road map. For this reason, rather than go back to law school, it is important to be strategic with legal counsel to make certain that you are making the best choices and decisions. Many times it is the experience of experienced practitioners that is helpful in getting one through the forest, not formal schooling.

Additionally, discuss the importance of understanding architectural choices when developing software systems. Architectural concepts play a crucial role in computer engineering, as they define how various components of a system are organized and interact with each other. In simple terms, architecture refers to the high-level structure and organization of a software system. It encapsulates the main components, their relationships, and the overall design pattern used to create and run the system.

There are several types of architecture, each with its own characteristics and applications:

1. Top-down: This approach starts with a single, high-level module and progressively breaks it down into smaller, more specific modules. The goal is to create a system that is modular, maintainable, and easy to understand. This architecture is commonly used in software development for its emphasis on modularity and reusability.

Example: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for web applications where the application logic is separated into model, view, and controller components.

2. Bottom-up: In contrast to top-down architecture, this approach starts with specific modules and constructs a system by combining them. It focuses on designing the most efficient and effective components. However, it may lead to complex interdependencies between components.

Example: The Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) architecture where separate modules are used for functionality such as logging, security, and exception handling, promoting clean separation of concerns.

3. Layered: This architecture distributes functionality across multiple layers, often vertically aligned. Each layer performs a specific task, and they communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces. This approach promotes modularity, scalability, and easy maintenance.

Example: The Client-Server architecture where different layers (e.g., application, presentation, data access) are responsible for specific tasks and communicate with each other.

4. Event-Driven: This type of architecture is based on events that trigger a response from the system. It is widely used in real-time systems and embedded systems where real-time constraints are important.

Example: The event-driven architecture for user interfaces where events like mouse clicks or key presses trigger actions in the application.

Understanding architectural choices is crucial when developing software systems for several reasons:

1. Clarity: A well-defined architecture helps clarify the system's purpose, scope, and dependencies. It aids communication between stakeholders, such as developers, project managers, and end-users, making it easier to understand the system's behavior and requirements.

2. Flexibility: An agile and",532,4,2898

Such is our state in the non-dual spiritual reality. To think of separation is just an illusion which is void of any substantial reality. Self is not a separate entity which is independent of everything else. Instead, if we try to think of self, we are referring to everything else which coexists with it. That is to say, there can be no self which is free from the existing material and spiritual aspects. We also understand that whatever we call self is only an outcome of our own interpretation or thinking, which originates with and which is controlled and guided by the Paramatma. Therefore, in the present article we will ponder upon the phases of meditation, the steps of self-realization, understanding duality and the way of ultimate realisation.
For some who can meditate, it can be a very much of a ride. However, those who have practised meditation regularly, try not to get too deep into it, for at the moment one would tend to forget to breathe properly. In deep meditation, you will be aware of everything but will not be disturbed by it. Duality, the state of duality, thus ceases to exist. There is nothing in this world which is permanent or eternal. As soon as I write a word, it changes itself into another word, so there is no permanent reality there. So, what is there to be understood? The only thing we understand to be permanent is our existence as a soul. In the present stage of our evolution, we are only concerned with our material existence as a human being, being a part of the material creation. The process of our initiation into the meditation was that you were already a spirit soul, or soul in the form of matter. Therefore, your consciousness at the present time is the sum total of the spiritual and the material, which brings you both pleasure and pain, ecstasy and despair, bondage and liberty, ego and humility. Whereas the ultimate stage of meditation is that there is no sense of pleasure or pain, ecstasy or despair, ego or humility, or bondage and liberty. There is only a state of equanimity which is the ultimate state of happiness. This is the state of thinking without any sense of doership. This is the state in which there is only presence. However, you can be in this state of meditation, even during the process of doing things, just by the strength of your own energy.

A model and your business – What we can learn from the Wing Tips model
I recently came across a very interesting post from a fellow entrepreneur called Steven Li who writes at MalaysianMust. The post was on the Wings model. I read it and could not help but just think “This is just brilliant!”.
The post describes the Wing model which makes a lot of sense. There is nothing really complicated about it but it just strikes a chord with me. I also do not think that it is restricted to only small businesses. Every business has to follow these principles to some degree (or in some variation to some extent).
In a recent conference (15 Dec 2008), Peter Fisk made a very good point which fits in perfectly. Peter said to always build your business based on the right value proposition, not the best value proposition. This aligns very well with the Wings model and helps you to stay focused and down-to-earth as a company.
For those who do not know the Wings model, I have some of it copied down here. (The original post can be found at MalaysianMust).

- Fully understand the market; customers, competitors, market trends and segmentation
- Evaluate your position in the market (the baseline position of where your business currently is as well as your target market)
- Focus on ‘Intimacy’ with your customers by offering personalized service (i.e. by catering to their needs, doing them and their business a favour, and by looking after your customers so that they return and feel comfortable to ask you for advice)

The quantum physics is as weird as the laws of the nature it creates, but much more subtle and mathematical in nature and oriented towards the structure of space-time continuum.  Mathematics is all about our model of reality. We should assume that everything we encounter in our day to day life happens at some point in space time continuum. The classical physics works fine until we investigate the sub atomic world. So here we are taking a brief look at quantum mechanics, what are wave functions, the uncertainty principle, the commutator, the idea of “wave function collapse” and how to solve the Schrodinger equation.

Q1. The wave function $f(x,y,z)$ represents a particle with energy $E$. The wavefunction has the general form,

$f(x,y,z) = A\sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\pi}}e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}p_{1}x}e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}p_{2}y}e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}p_{3}z}$,

where $A$ is a constant and $p_{i}$ is the momentum operator. Calculate $p_{3}^2$ for this particle if $p_{i} = px$, $A = \alpha$ and $E = h/2$.

Solution:
Using the mentioned values for the particle, the three momentum operators are,

$p_{1} = h \alpha cos\theta$ with $\theta = 0$

$p_{2} = h \alpha \sin\theta$

$p_{3} = 0$.

Where $\alpha = \hbar p_{1} = \hbar h cos\theta$ is the de Broglie wavelength which is the classical wavelength associated with the momentum and

$h = \frac{\hbar p_{2}}{\alpha}$ is the relationship between momentum and the de Broglie wavelength.

Astronomy has an impact on every aspect of our daily lives.

The impact of astronomy on daily life is enormous, and includes every aspect of the activities that make up our civilization. In fact, without astronomy, most of our civilization as we know it would not be possible. Below is a very small fraction of the many ways we benefit from this amazing field of study.

Navigation

The stars can tell us which direction we are moving. Much of the world relies on the ability to navigate with the aid of the stars. Someone making a short ocean voyage from one end of the world to the other would simply look for reference stars in the sky. Someone traveling even short distances overland would also be using a compass to determine in which direction to go. These techniques were used for centuries by our ancestors, and they are still the basis of much of our navigation today, particularly in marine navigation.

The Greeks and the Arabs built the first true starscopes. They were very big, taking up entire rooms in order to gather enough light to do observations. Because of their size, they were limited in what they could observe. Only big stars and deep sky objects, such as nebulae, were visible in any detail.

Traveling nearly to the Moon (diameter 3474 km) and the Sun (diameter 1.4 million km), which are 400 and 385 times as far away respectively, astronomers need extremely precise measurements of these heavenly bodies. The smallest objects astronomers study are much smaller than the sizes of those celestial bodies. For example, stars are very tiny with respect to the size of the Sun. Galileo could study this tiny distance with his small telescope with the eye of a naked eye. The biggest moon of Jupiter could not be seen in the biggest telescope, and they had to change the size of the telescope until it reached the size that could capture Jupiter. A letter from Hevelius to Rock says the following:

""Consider how few rulers are skilled in measuring the limb of the Sun; there are three astronomers among 3,000 (600th) of the Faculty of Physics. It would be just as good if at the Faculty of Medicine the hundredth (the 100th) were physicians, and the first ten were masters of poppy juice, or even quinine, to provide me with some hint. With regard to the telescope, with such masters there is nothing new in the world.""

The ocean covers more than 71% of the surface of the Earth and contains over 97% of the Earth’s water. Most of it is quite salty. Scientists can measure the salinity, and they can also measure the temperature in some places. 

Question: Why is the ocean only x% salty? The ocean is approximately 3.5% salt[4][5], although this percentage changes over time due to the flow of salt into and out of the ocean[2]. This salinity helps to keep all living organisms alive in the water[4], and it is also important to study the ocean because it has a major effect on the climate and the overall health of the earth[5].",175,4,730
1828,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is truly fascinating. Whether it is discovering new minerals, finding solutions to problems on Earth or even creating new technology, space exploration has been an important part of our society. In this blog post, we'll take a look at five reasons why space exploration is so important today.

1. Scientific advancements: One of the most important reasons why space exploration is so important is that it has led to many scientific advancements. For example, the study of cosmic microwave background radiation, which is a remnant of the Big Bang, has helped scientists better understand the origins of the universe. Additionally, space missions have helped us discover new minerals and other resources that could be used for human exploration and development on other planets.

2. Environmental monitoring: Space exploration has also been used to monitor Earth's environment. Satellites have been used to measure air quality, track changes in temperature, and monitor deforestation. These data have helped scientists and policymakers understand how our planet is changing and develop strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change.

3. Space exploration has led to the development of new technology: The technology used in space exploration has also had a huge impact on our daily lives. For example, digital cameras, GPS systems, and even microwave ovens all have their origins in space exploration.

4. Economic impact: Space exploration has also had a huge economic impact on our society. The space industry creates jobs, stimulates technological innovation, and provides a source of income for businesses both in the United States and around the world.

5. Educational opportunities: Finally, space exploration has provided educational opportunities for people around the world. Many students are inspired by watching missions and learning about the science behind them. The International Space Station has also become a popular destination for science classes and school field trips.

In conclusion, space exploration has played a crucial role in modern society by advancing science, monitoring the environment, fostering technological innovation, generating economic opportunities, and inspiring education. The continued development and expansion of our space exploration capabilities will be essential to solving many of the world's most pressing issues. While space exploration may seem like an expensive and risky endeavor, the benefits it provides to our society make it a worthwhile investment.",441,4,2512
1829,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and its impact on modern medicine.
The history of genetics began in the 19th century when Gregor Mendel, a monk, discovered the laws of inheritance. He conducted experiments on pea plants to show that traits such as height, color and shape were inherited from parents to offspring. These findings laid the foundation for modern genetics. However, it was not until the 20th century that genetics research advanced dramatically with the discovery of DNA and the scientific field of molecular genetics.

In the 1950s and 1960s, it was discovered that genes were made up of small, specific pieces of DNA. This discovery led to advances in the study of genetics, including the mapping of the human genome and the development of techniques such as gene therapy.

In the 1980s and 1990s, genetic research led to the discovery of important genes involved in cancer and other diseases. This research led to new cancer treatments that targeted specific genes and proteins. In the 2000s, genetic research continued to advance with the development of precision medicine, which involves identifying the specific genetic variations associated with an individual's disease. This allowed for more targeted treatment and better outcomes.

Today, genetics is used in medicine to diagnose and treat diseases, predict the likelihood of developing a disease or condition, and develop new treatments. It has also enabled personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to an individual's specific genetic makeup. The impact of genetics on modern medicine is significant and will continue to shape the future of healthcare.

This is fascinating. Can you add some more information about how genetics is used to diagnose and treat diseases?
Certainly! Genetics is now used in a variety of ways to diagnose and treat diseases, such as cancer, genetic disorders, and rare diseases. Here are some examples:

1. Cancer diagnosis and treatment: Scientists now understand that many types of cancer arise from specific genes that have been altered. By analyzing a person's genetic material, doctors can identify those genes and determine which cancer treatments are most likely to be effective.

2. Rare diseases: Many rare diseases are caused by genetic mutations, and a growing number of genetic tests are being developed to help diagnose and treat these conditions. Researchers are also working to develop drugs that can target specific genetic mutations that cause certain diseases.

3. Genetic counseling: People with a family history of certain genetic disorders can benefit from genetic counseling. Genetic counselors can help them understand their risks for certain diseases and guide them in making decisions about getting tested for genetic conditions.

1831,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is that anyone can follow this roadmap and create a stage to do it. That’s the joy of theater, and it is true regardless of the size or status of the theater you desire. To create an excellent theater space, it starts with the appropriate budget, a creative focus, and an eye toward the best use of the space.
A performance venue of any size can benefit from having a commercial-grade A/V system that can help engage the audience, create an intimate atmosphere, and make the performers and audience safer. Careful analysis of the needs and goals for the performance venue will help determine the systems to put in place.
As an example, let’s look at a church or school setting. If you are starting a theater, a big challenge is space. Often the best space to build in is in an existing sanctuary or auditorium. These facilities likely have been built with a focused speaker system, perhaps some colored lighting, and basic switching gear or maybe sound equipment. Re-purposing the space might simply mean covering old carpeting, painting walls white, installing a new stage floor with trap doors, switches, and channels that allow sound and lighting to move easily from one end of the stage to another. Upgrading to a computerized lighting console will help create the desired ambience.
The next step is to determine what technology is needed to help supplement or supplement the facility’s audiovisual needs. The most cost-effective and quickest approach is to purchase or install legacy equipment. This is not necessarily the correct approach, as the introduction of new technologies can add value to the space. To add value, new technologies can enhance the audience’s viewing experience, optimize the building’s acoustics, help future-proof the space, and bring an “upgrade” to the end user.
Taking into account the architecture of the existing building, any equipment needs to be installed in a manner that can’t be seen by the end user. Some venues that have lower ceiling heights require adjustments such as theatrical grid installation or motorized lighting fixtures. These approaches will not only provide an upgraded look but also may allow for better acoustics.
Integration of the electronic systems should go beyond the standard control of the in-house lighting and sound. The equipment installed should address the venue’s needs for video conference calls, rehearsals, performances, viewing spaces, training, and presentations. Areas like these will greatly enhance and update the way the people in the space are working and interacting. They will also enhance the viewing experience by providing a larger viewing and immersive environment, which is what a modern environment strives",528,4,2697

From there, it seemed only a few ticks of the evolutionary clock to the gigantism and hyper-intelligence of The Singularity. It was just a matter of time, most thought, for nature to close that last genetic loop. Consider the playing cards – the pyramid scheme leading human beings from the animal to the divine.
So who knew about the obstacle? If a cube is stacked, all six sides meet – unless one side missteps and falls flat on the ground. A pyramid, on the other hand, demands each level hold its weight upon itself – unless it fails, will be its own tombstone. Guess who rolled the die – that’s right, human beings. The ones who cried for Mother Nature to get off their backs, demanding yet more nectar, more honey, more seafood caught where? Guess who’s smelling more than the last page from the menu – that’s right, the poor mother earth herself.
Enjoy, invent, tinker. But by all means – use your technology to build bigger and bigger pyramids. Build upon your pyramids, big or small, level or crooked. For when the world breaks apart, your foundations will crumble with your hopes, dreams, desires, and most of all your money (because all that’s really left of you is your invisible money – the only legacy you’ll have left). So humans – all living creatures, really – utilize your position in the ‘Pyramid Theory’ and don’t create a Pyramidal Burden. You will only leave a Pyramidal Burden for the rest of us. Thanks.

1834,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," I never much cared for paintings, or sculpture, or even pottery. I did like the drawings and collages my classmates did when in my art classes, but I was never impressed. I couldn’t tell one masterpiece from another.
In 1992, I went to the St. Paul Art Fair at the Minnesota state fair grounds. It had a large jewelry area. I chose a bauble, when two older women asked if I would be willing to trade it for one of theirs. I usually refused, but their collection included necklaces with genuine opals, so I agreed. We made the swap. I never saw the necklace again.
A couple of months later, I was in a nursery school in Blue Earth, Minnesota. My task was to help the children study nature. I think it was supposed to be a teacher work day, although nobody showed up. Perhaps my class was too young, for I remember the teacher telling me it was “too noisy.”
I already had my next assignment, and was already en route by the time the teacher pointed out the bird nest in the top of a birch tree. Someone had flipped up a small dead branch, revealing the whole structure. The parents were yellow-rumped warblers. I had only recently heard of them, although I grew up in a rural area. During the school break, I taught myself a lot about them and I’ve always been glad to find one. I had previously seen them in the summer, but that was when they were in the light of day. I have been fortunate to see them in the early morning, or on a dull gray afternoon, and their color is clearer than in the summer sun.
I took the liberty of removing the dead branch and doing some renovations. Two of the nestlings were very new. If they were female, their color would turn almost black, but two of them were already at least two-thirds yellow. They looked too weak to survive a rude swoop down from above. They seemed to realize it, too.
In the afterglow of my project, I rushed back to the nursery school, to find it closed. I didn’t even try the front door. I sprinted up the sidewalk to the newly repaired nest. I lifted the camera from my pack, to photograph it. The nestlings were struggling a bit, but looked to have sufficient strength in their tiny wings. The mother came and picked them up and flew over to the dead bush. By the time I retrieved my camera, she had laid two of the",515,4,2276

In the heart of the 1960s, people all across America were filled with excitement as they eagerly awaited the day of their greatest journey. It was on this journey that mankind was to set foot on the moon - the most distant of worlds.

The Boeing Titan II rocket slowly began to lift its colossal frame from Cape Kennedy's Launch Complex 34. It left behind the glare of the setting sun, a golden orb setting in the Florida sky like some fiery ball of clay. An exhilarating chill danced up my spine as I stood on the observation platform with my eyes fixed on the rocket, no longer anchored to earth but ascending into the cosmos.

When we reached lunar orbit, our mission control team announced that Neil Armstrong and Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin would descend to the moon’s surface in the Lunar Module 'Eagle'. As Aldrin reclined in the cockpit, Armstrong stepped out onto the lunar surface. As he lifted his foot off the Lunar Module, he uttered those immortal words - ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""

The echoes of this monumental achievement rang throughout the world, uniting us in our awe and wonder. We all felt a part of history being made.

But this was just the beginning. One small step, indeed. This was only the first step in our voyage to the unknown. And we knew there were more steps to come. For this was not the end, it was simply another beginning.

Back on earth, my family gathered around the old black and white television, our eyes glued to the screen, waiting for more news. The reporters rambled on about the mission's success, but it was their faces and body language that spoke volumes. There was a sense of cautious hope in their voices, a hope that we would continue to reach for the stars.

As the years passed, we did continue to reach for the stars. We sent probes to Jupiter and Saturn, and even set foot on Mars. But it all began on that September day in 1969, when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon’s surface.

Our dream of travelling to the moon has since been achieved. But the spirit of adventure, the hope, the sense of awe that filled us as we awaited the lunar landing never faded. It stayed with us through decades and continues to inspire generations today. Because whether we're gazing at the stars, dreaming about the future, or contemplating the",504,4,2374

For example, one of the most important inventions of the 19th century was the railway, which changed the way that we transported things across the country and provided us with the ability to travel further than ever before. Before the railway, a person, carrying a small load, might walk or ride on a horse as far as they needed to go. However, with railways, they could simply get on a train and travel to their destination. It is easy to think that something as obvious as travelling on a train can’t have been the work of just one person, but this is in fact the case.
One of the most important thinkers in the history of sociology, Karl Marx, famously talked about how the capitalist system was created. He argued that the industrial revolution caused mass unemployment, which drove large numbers of people to try and find work, whether it was digging for coal, carrying goods on a horse-drawn carriage, or selling products in shops. But another person who had a huge impact on the modern world was John Aspinall. Aspinall was a businessman who lived in the 19th century. He was a pharmacist and was in the process of opening a new shop.
During this time, he noticed that there were no places for people to get their blood tests done. So, he decided to do something about this issue. He created a place where people could get their blood tests done for free. John Aspinall's idea for the laboratory was to provide a service to people who couldn’t afford to go to the doctor, and provide a service that was not available to the general public.
The business model of an advertisement agent, a marketing professional, who, as in the case of John Aspinall, may also be responsible for public relations, has expanded in recent years and has become a modern industry. The rise of the media, especially television, has made it easier for people to gain knowledge about different products, services, and products. The proliferation of technologies and technologies have made it easier for people to learn about different things.
The rise of technology has also contributed to the increasing popularity of social media. Social media can be considered to be a form of advertising, but it is also a form of education.

The rise of the Internet has made it easier for people to find information about products and services.

What are the uses of art in the home, on the street, at work, and in the world? Discussing these and other questions, the National Gallery of Art will open America’s Image: The First Hundred Years, a new exhibition on November 20.
The exhibition covers the period from the inception of the Art Commission of the District of Columbia in 1870 to the present. Including 150 paintings and sculptures, this exhibition illustrates the complexity of art in America over the years, while stressing that art has always been an expression of that most essential American value: individual self-expression.
“Art is the only avenue to the soul, and I have been privileged to bear witness to the poets, story tellers, listeners, healers, magicians, bards, and artists – all who have played their part in the triumph of the human spirit,” said National Gallery of Art Director Harry L. Smith.
The American image of today is a very different one than a century ago. Today’s American image, represented by artists from Edward Hopper to Georgia O’Keeffe and Charles Sheeler, reflects this country’s enthusiasm for consumerism, modernism, and technology. But the preoccupation with personal relationships, the caring for children, and the admiration of the natural world remain constant.
Artists’ images of the American countryside, the interior and exterior of the home, the artist in his studio, and the nation’s rich heritage are all represented in the exhibition.
In addition to paintings, sculpture, and lithographs, American images of the past and present are portrayed in new art forms, such as movie films, cartoons, advertising, photography, architectural ornament, industry, and modern design.
“The major messages and implications of this exhibition are that the evolution of American art mirrors the evolution of American society and culture, and that the deliberate roles art has played in society — from propaganda to personal expression — always have something important to say about what is important to all Americans in contemporary times,” noted Chief Curator Susan Cheever.
Art in America: The First Hundred Years draws its name from the mural painted by Elliott Daingerfield (1859-1937) for the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in 1908. Daingerfield’s mural depicted the early history of America as a story of settlers whose endeavors formed the Republic and the pre-existing relationship of America with the rest of the world",507,4,2520

Business continuity plans become more important than ever before. Knowing how to be resilient is the new requirement for 21st century resilience planning.
While resilience planning may have the best of intentions, the disruptions an organization faces often fall outside the limits of that plan. In some instances, an external issue, such as climate change, can take a company completely by surprise. Issues such as political unrest in foreign nations can hamper a company’s ability to gain access to raw materials or transportation of products. One of the biggest threats to physical security today is terrorism, which can take down operations and even change the face of the company in an extreme situation.

May 18, 2018 - 3:55pm , by R. V. Tsagaris

You know the ""what-ifs""? What if a mad scientist happened to figure out how to clone dinosaurs?

For 19 years the debate has been ongoing as to how realistic Jurassic Park was or wasn't. Or how believable or not. And apparently, there's no consensus. And probably none exists.

The movie is obviously fictional, but some of the science behind it is inspired by real research and for example of some of the ideas that influenced the original book and movie but you don't see in it are: ""[...] massive global overdispersal of dinosaurs through drift ice at the end of the Cretaceous Period [that] created the first, but far smaller, wave of today's vertebrate dispersals, the ""K-T extinction event"", and ""paleogeography of Tethys, parapedicels or dendricels""

Anyway, the movie does a great job of showing a fictional setting and reflecting things that geologists find to be true in a certain way. Like this video that shows us the timeline of the characters traveling from mainland to Isla Nublar and back. The geologist's, Sean, shown is pretty much accurately reproducing the function of a compass in this travel route, except for one tiny hitch, i.e. the Jurassic Park research base, at Isla Nublar is further south than what it really should be (20 years ago you would have likely found the island in the Florida state on the map). But other than that, you can do this from one region of the map to another and it is useful for estimating the direction of travel. So it's not to be taken literally. But please, enjoy the video and see how Jurassic Park has affected our interpretation of geologic time and distances on earth.

Engineers have played a crucial role in shaping the modern world, and have made countless contributions to various fields such as agriculture, construction, transportation, energy, and communication. For instance, the wheel was invented by ancient Sumerians, and it revolutionized transportation by enabling faster movement of people and goods. Similarly, the Romans developed concrete, which revolutionized construction and allowed them to build impressive structures such as the Colosseum and aqueducts.

The first step to becoming better at writing poetry is to read as much poetry as you can! Since poetry is subjective, it can be a bit overwhelming when picking out poetry to read, but simply pick a style of poetry, and find poems that reflect that style. You may find that you like an odd style of poetry that you never read before. Finding an author that you like may also be a great way to find poetry that you like, though you may want to focus on finding writing styles that aren’t too strange.
Once you have gathered a collection of poetry that you like, it’s time to start writing poetry. Even if you’re writing solely for yourself at this point, it is still a fantastic exercise that can improve your writing. In fact, many writers find that writing poetry after first reading poetry improves their prose and poetry writing. Whatever style of poetry you write, make sure that it’s meaningful to you.
For some students, these days are so busy they don’t even have the time or energy to write poetry! For these students, it’s time to find an outlet to write poetry or to give it up. Don’t worry, it’s not a talent that you’re meant to have. However, if you absolutely love writing poetry, don’t stop trying! Even if you’re not writing poetry, you can still read poetry! You can find poetry reading tips here!
If you find that you cannot manage to find the time, energy, or motivation to write poetry, then a great way to improve your poetry is to start writing. Even though you may not be good at writing at first, getting better at writing is a great way to improve your poetry. Writing every day will help you get over the minor details in your poetry, and your poetry can still have a lot of meaning and heart.
While you can spend the time writing, reading, and revising your poetry, a great way to work on improving your poetry is to join a poetry writing group. A poetry writing group will give you the time and motivation to improve your poetry. You can find poetry writing groups in cities around the world. Here are a few groups to help you get started!

It is short, to the point, at just under 2 minutes, and contains some impressive 3D animation work. Indeed, according to Collins, if you’re wondering what 3D animation looks like when the camera can only move forward and not left or right, all you need is to find a camera phone. “I thought it would be kind of interesting to limit my technical means and try and see what I could get away with,” says the filmmaker, who has also used all practical locations in the production.
The film features his wife, actress Aoife Mulholland, who plays an anonymous critic who only has eyes for the film. Instead, her concentration seems focused on one part of the movie — the ending. In fact, her character comes across as more obsessive than the protagonist of a film. Those all-knowing eyes of hers gave Collins a place to put the ending of the film. Once her character becomes so focused on the film’s ending, Collins knew the film was only going to move in one direction.

Allison, Sheila (2004) The ethics of biology and human genetic engineering. UNSPECIFIED. (Unpublished)
Abstract
The new molecular biology has transformed our understanding of the origins, nature and culture of life. It has led to new forms of biotechnology, new scientific perspectives, and new social, legal, and economic problems. The ethical debate about this new biology revolves around a careful analysis of the knowledge created and the new possibilities brought about by the new biotechnology. Although from a particular disciplinary perspective, advances in molecular biology are giving the field new challenges to its core research. The rapid developments of biotechnology, provide new means for extending reproductive practices, and new methods of increasing economic productivity. Many ethicists, however, oppose genetically engineering the human germ line or the embryos. This paper argues that this opposition is misguided. Because the risk of damaging the sequence on which life depends is so great, there are other reasons to be wary of the technique. Even if it were proven safe to make minor modifications to the genome, the lack of prospect of advantage is not enough to justify an experiment that cannot be easily reversed. The rush to use it for human enhancement is almost wholly undeserving of serious consideration.",247,4,1370

Earthscience workflow is the routine process that geoscientists implement to collect, combine and make sense of geoscientific data, information and knowledge, in support of decision making for sustainable social and economical growth of populations and their environments. Advances in geoscience informatics, data and information management, geoscience services and high-performance computing enable comprehensive and timely answers to the complex problems that remain unsolved at times. The development of a modelling-based methodology or prototypal implementation of a new tool is not the main purpose of workflow in geosciences. Instead, the focus is on integrating various disciplinary skills and approaching a problem end-to-end with a single work-flow tool or an infrastructure of geoscience services.

1857,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and how it determines our skin colour
Black people have more of the pigment melanin, which absorbs sunlight, in their skin, hair and eyes, than do whites (people of European origin). Genetics account for a lot of how we are born with a particular skin colour. And in today’s world, skin colour does not contribute to our usefulness on earth. In most parts of Africa, people on average, are of fairer skin and that’s probably because most of Africa has both black and white people. But what if all of Africa was filled with people of a single colour – say brown, would any person of any colour feel out of place among the crowd, or worse; will everyone living in Africa be regarded as inferior?
Let’s first look at how one could be born with fair skin, while the other born with dark skin.
How does one get skin colour?
There are three types of melanins found in our skin: black, brown and red. The type of melanin is determined by the number of genes you inherit from your parents. If you get only one gene of the type of melanin you don’t get the colour that comes with the other gene you get from your mother or father. That’s why parents who look alike, have generally similar colour of skin or hair, because they have more or less similar sets of melanin genes inherited from their parents.
Taking this further, the type of melanin is given by 10 genes – two from the mother and two from the father. So if you get 5 black (a recessive trait) genes and 5 brown (a dominant trait) genes, you’re likely to have brown skin, irrespective of your sex.
What about African regions and skin colour?
Africa is a diverse continent, with various different skin colours, hair textures and hair types. In any of the regions, people usually get either of the two. African countries are rich in diversity, as more than 2000 ethnic groups inhabit the continent. As for skin colour, there are dark, brown, light and fair skinned Africans, regardless of their region. Besides, there is so much of variety as far as the eye can see.
What will happen if we all decide to be of a particular colour?
Having the same colour skin, would certainly not be a disadvantage, but is it the best way to co-exist? People say humans have just evolved into a one colour skin type, or that our skin pigmentation indicates the regions humans evolved in. However, there is no",520,4,2342

Though he was not known as a poet, Pablo Picasso once wrote, “Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.” There’s a lot of poetic truth in that. Though we are charged with talking about architecture in poetic terms, what we do is tied to reality. We build and live in real, identifiable buildings, some designed by ourselves and others designed by others. For me, architecture is filled with ethical considerations. Any building we design is a part of our body and those that we intend to live in or use; buildings are human, too. Too much misplaced and badly designed building is a tragedy, and though we can be the catalyst for architectural tragedy, we can also be a part of mitigating tragedy and celebrating architecture’s ability to make us realize truth.

The history of theater masks in ancient Greece dates back to the 5th century BCE when the Greek playwrights began to use them in their performances. These masks were an integral part of Greek theater, and they were used to depict various characters on the stage.

Before the use of masks, the performers would wear costumes and makeup to represent their characters, but the masks allowed them to embody the personality and mannerisms of the characters more fully. The masks were made from natural materials such as wood or leather and were decorated with bright colors, intricate patterns, and impressive beading.

The Greek masks were significant in Greek drama because they added a whole new dimension to the performances. They allowed the actors to express the emotions and thoughts of their characters more realistically and powerfully, making the audience more engrossed in the story. The masks also helped the actors to blend into their roles, making them appear more believable and giving the audience a deeper connection with the characters.

Moreover, the masks were an essential part of the aesthetics of Greek theater. The bright and colorful masks added to the visual appeal of the performances, making them more memorable and captivating. They also had religious significance, as many of them represented the gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon.

In ancient Greece, theater masks were often used in performances that featured mythological stories and religious rituals. They were commonly used in tragedies, comedies, and satires, as well as in festivals and religious ceremonies.

In conclusion, theater masks were an essential part of Greek drama, adding a new dimension to the performances and allowing the actors to embody their characters more fully. They added to the visual appeal of the theater and were an integral part of the religious and artistic culture of ancient Greece.

Wow, I never knew theater masks had so much significance in Greek drama. Do you have any examples of famous Greek plays that featured masks?
Yes, there are several famous Greek plays that featured masks, including:

1. Agamemnon - This is one of the earliest Greek tragedies, written by Aeschylus in the 5th century BCE. The play features a large ensemble of characters, many of whom are portrayed by different masks.

2. Medea - This is another tragedy written by Euripides, also from the 5th century BCE. The play features several characters portrayed by masks, including Medea herself.

Rapid development of robotics and unmanned systems is set to revolutionize the way oil and gas companies do business on the marine and offshore oil fields. Robotics is opening up new opportunities for offshore oil and gas operators to reduce environmental impact, improve profitability, and enhance offshore workers' safety.

One of the most common uses of robotics in the offshore oil and gas industry is in inspection and maintenance activities. Remote inspection and maintenance, conducted by unmanned systems, can enhance operational efficiency, improve the overall safety, and reduce worker exposure to dangerous environments. Robot technology can help increase the effectiveness of a company's inspection and maintenance programs while reducing risk and costs associated with offshore accidents, injuries and regulatory compliance.

Robotic technologies have been adopted on a wider scale across various applications in the offshore sector, including:

1. Subsea inspection and repair
2. Well intervention and maintenance
3. Standoff survey
4. Pipeline monitoring and maintenance
5. Asset inspection and monitoring
6. Offshore wind operations
7. Environmental management
8. Waste disposal

With rapidly advancing technology, robotics has become an integral part of the oil and gas industry, and it's predicted to significantly impact business growth and profitability in the coming years.

That's fascinating! Can you tell me more about how robotics is being used for offshore wind operations?

Certainly! Robotics is playing a significant role in offshore wind operations, providing solutions for challenges like installing and maintaining wind turbines, performing inspections, and reducing environmental impact.

One of the most significant applications of robotics in offshore wind operations is the deployment of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). These vehicles can be equipped with sensors and cameras that enable real-time monitoring, inspections, and maintenance of offshore wind turbines and the underlying sea floor.

ROVs and AUVs can carry out tasks such as subsea pipeline inspection, underwater image and video capture, and the deployment of mooring systems. AUVs can also conduct surveys of the sea floor and collect data related to underwater obstacles and geological surveys. These vehicles can access the ocean and marine environment that is typically hazardous and inaccessible to humans.

Furthermore, robotics technology is being used to construct offshore wind turbines. This is achieved using the use of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) that are equipped with cranes and hoists. USVs can safely lift equipment and parts to offshore installation vessels, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of injury or damage to equipment.

Lawrence H. Laidlaw, a Filipino political and economic analyst, has written a book, The Economic Foundations of Philippine Labor, that will probably be talked about for a long time.
It is important to know one’s history to better understand the present. In this book, Prof. Laidlaw reminds us that according to the German sociologist Max Weber, “a nation is a collective ego made possible by tradition.” Despite the anti-dictatorship struggle of the early 1980s, the people’s spirit of heroism for the independence of the country and their free will were crushed by Martial Law.
This manifestation of patriotism helped organize a genuine movement for freedom.
Prof. Laidlaw was one of the students who sustained the hopes of the Freedom Movement during Martial Law.
In 1977, at the age of 27, he wrote Essays on My Childhood.
The book was an attempt “to show how the social class, a fundamental component of the national economy, shaped both the political consciousness and behavior of the Filipino.
Last May 4, the National Historical Institute officially recognized Essays on My Childhood as one of the “100 Most Important Books in the Filipino Language” and it is included in the book list of Balikbayan books that are available in book stores in the United States.
When Filipinos in the early 1900s organized themselves to fight the Spanish colonial government and to demand the liberalization of trade and commerce, Filipinos eventually achieved independence.
For many years, the idea of a competitive economy such as that of the United States seemed to be its own end and was in itself a “good” in itself.
Prof. Laidlaw stressed the importance of entrepreneurial development through the experience of independent service and creative skills, where competition is constrained by the rules of the game. The “rule of the game” was so ingrained that, according to Prof. Laidlaw, only markets and not the state could have a central role in the developing economy.
He added that the problems of social unrest, growing inequality, and general injustice might likely get worse in the coming years if market economics is not harmonized with social policies that would be grounded on the principle of egalitarianism. In his book, Prof",483,4,2446

By the end of 1983, 250 girls and 250 boys would be dead. At this rate, we could expect 1200 women and 1200 men to be alive at the end of 1985.
The environments (boys and girls, respectively) in this example are simple. Specifically, the “environments” in this example are our assumptions about sex. There is no rate of change of child mortality rate in Katchaturia because of changes in environment.
In our three decades of war and revolution, environmental statistics proliferated in Katchaturia. These include all populations of women and men who have died of diseases or who have died by other modes of death in each year since 1956, not only the populations at the end of a year, but also the populations throughout the year. Since 1956, the war and the revolution have produced highly complex environments—environments with very rapid and extensive rates of change.

They have already developed into exciting and immersive events that offer a competitive edge in sports, where players need to know how to be the smartest players in the game.
We all know how hard it is to beat a slots machine, especially when it’s been programmed to have a high RTP (return to player) rate. But in such a competitive industry it’s possible to develop the skill to turn the odds in your favour. In the world of online casino, games have become the new sports arenas for people trying to beat the system, particularly when it comes to horse racing and greyhound racing.
This does take a lot of skill, experience, strategy and knowledge, but it has the potential to give players a winning edge. Plus, for those who’ve played the games for a while, it can sometimes feel like betting on sports. So let’s take a look at how these games work and how you can develop the skills to turn the odds in your favour.
Does Bluffing Work in Online Poker?
There’s little doubt that online poker is the most known online casino game by players. The popularity of online poker owes a lot to the strategy behind the game, the potential for quick and huge profits, and the many tournaments and TV broadcasts of the game. Online poker is just one example of gambling that can give you a big advantage if you know how to play the game.
The same goes for online horse racing betting. As a player, you must analyse every available piece of information and understand the next game before it even begins. In both cases, the smarter players are the ones who can interpret the odds and predict their outcome.
Horse racing and greyhound racing are incredibly popular as online casino games and in the UK, the UK Betting and Gaming Commission are making big changes to online gambling in order to protect consumers. New regulations to the UK’s Gambling Act mean that brands will need to be more transparent, age verification is being made a lot tougher, and the techniques used by online casinos are being limited and controlled. There is good news, however, because players are getting access to all the information they need, and the games have become more interactive with more actual betting statistics than you’ll find in any land-based casino.
The dangers of underage gambling can often be solved with age verification. This includes proof of age and an existing digital ID, such as a passport or driver’s licence, which you’ll need to prove online to access a game",525,4,2575

Meteorology, the study of the atmosphere, is not as glamorous as I once thought it was when I was a young child. During thunderstorms I pictured wind harnessing clouds of tornadoes, but no such luck for most of us. Instead, it's a boring, tedious chore made up of non-stop satellite imagery, numerical forecast models, and lots and lots of data. There's simply no way that a lot of people would be interested in studying all of that stuff if it weren't a necessity. I admit that I couldn't become as knowledgeable as I am today without my meteorology professor encouraging me to challenge my preconceived notions about the weather. Today meteorology is more than a passion for me and truly a career.
So, how do you become a meteorologist?
- First, you must always realize that meteorology is a constantly evolving field. Consider yourself well educated if you're familiar with a particular decade. The field is always changing and new scientific tools and methods are incorporated on a regular basis. Keep up with it or you will quickly fall behind.
- In some cases meteorology is an act of art. Take a look at some high quality weather maps to see how good of a visual artist you may be. It's not unusual to find a visually-challenged meteorologist at the forecast desk. It's often much more comfortable to read a map and make an educated guess about what's coming than to create a weather map from scratch.
- The best general advice is to study hard and don't follow the traditional route of simply looking up physics equations on the internet and copying them down in order to pass an exam. You will actually be somewhat surprised if you start out studying physics and then venture into meteorology. In fact, your first step may be to start studying atmospheric science. You should read as much as you can about the atmosphere if you want to become a meteorologist. Some of the best meteorologists were athletes while others were admitted into the Jax-Navy ROTC program, both which ultimately led to careers in meteorology.
- Next, you must be very self motivated to be a meteorologist. You must make many sacrifices in order to be a meteorologist. Most of you don't have any family history to fall back on and most of your families can't afford to help you to pay for school. Aside from that, just about everyone who makes it in the field is good at what they do. In some cases they are spectacular. There's a shortage of meteorologists. That's a",530,4,2451

It seems that there are lots of questions that people pose regarding proper gardening and the tools used to facilitate this venture. Proper care is a need for the plants in your garden. Garden tools for gardening are definitely in the must-have list of home gardeners. This is the usual tool kit that every home gardener should have to maintain and look after your garden. Some of these tools include a rakes, spade, shovel and plow.
Digging a patch of dirt for your seeds is not an easy task. This is why you should own a few garden tools such as a spade, shovel and a spade. A spade or spades are used to loosen and turn soil. Shovels on the other hand are more wider and flat, thus capable to uproot the entire piece of plant. Planting a seed and making small cuts in the ground using a spade or spade is not an easy task. This requires a powerful digging motion. A spade can be used for cutting some of the soft roots of fruits and vegetables, especially when it comes to pulling them out from the ground. Gardening is not easy to do. But, with the use of these garden tools you can do your gardening the smart way.
It seems that people are always confused and concerned about the ideal choice of hand tools. The right choice must take into consideration your personal preferences, the type of soil you have and the difficulty of the work. There are some sets of hand tools called a Hoe, Bypass Lopper, Pruner, and Secateur. These are just simple tools that are actually used for gardening.
In choosing your hand tools, it is best to go for a set that you are comfortable with and is easy to use. These simple tools are easy to carry around when you are gardening. Your gardening job may sometimes take longer hours, so having the right set of tools makes gardening a more easier and efficient process. These garden tools are essential for you to work around your plants and for you to get on with your gardening work with absolute ease. There are some homeowners who do not fancy using a lot of gardening tools to maintain the look of their gardens. You may also choose to do gardening manually if you are not accustomed to using a lot of gardening tools. But if you really wanted to have an effective and productive gardening, you must at least have the basic hand tools in your gardening repertoire. How important is it to",506,4,2439

Abstract
This paper analyses the characteristics of the integration of music and mathematics in mathematics classroom. A qualitative method was employed to acquire the ground information that reflects the identity of mathematics and music that are having reciprocal influence. The aim of this study is to create and sustain positive outlook of GCSE students through exploring mathematics through different perspectives. In the first stage, I analysed and drew inferences from the media reports and statistics to identify the problems faced by mathematics students. In the second stage, I performed an exploratory study on teachers' perspectives on the integration of music and mathematics in mathematics classroom. In the third stage, I designed and performed a research experiment to explore and discover the characteristics of the music-mathematics integration in mathematics classroom. The questionnaire and case study approach were used in this study. I collected the data through personal interviews, a questionnaire and case study. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, content analysis, and qualitative approaches. This study led to a positive outlook of mathematics by organizing and conducting some important music-related projects such as math band, math orchestra, math orchestra concert and music concert.

1873,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,"Most astronomy buffs readily admit they were drawn to the field because of starry sky or because their friends were going to a star gazing event. People in general are fascinated with the idea of the heavens. And that fascination has triggered both the study of astronomy, and belief in star gazing. Often when people hear ""star gazing,"" they think ""astrology."" It's a shame. Here's what you know (and don't know) about astronomy.
Myth 1. All stars are the same color. The above image, taken at a relatively ""blue"" part of the spectrum (left), looks strangely red. Astronomers call this phenomenon a ""redshift"" - a trait often found in galaxies at the edge of the Universe. Colors are selected based on the blue component of an object's light. The right side image is the above image plus the ""red"" signal subtracted - the true nature of stars on the left is revealed.
Myth 2. We live inside a big cave. It's not often made clear but the Earth is only about 127,000 miles across. The moon's diameter is 2,160 miles, so the moon isn't significantly bigger than your backyard. So why does it look so much bigger than the sun? The sun and moon are so distant we don't actually ""see"" their large size - we see their reflected light.
Myth 3. There's a black hole at the center of our galaxy. Many astronomers think there's something at the center of our galaxy that has a mass so great, a so-called ""singularity,"" that gravity is so strong that nothing - not even light - can escape. We have strong evidence this is the case. But if you can remember that light doesn't really ""escape"" black holes - it gets sucked into them, we can say ""something"" is there.
Myth 4. If you get far enough away from the Earth, you'll get away from the Moon. Just because the Moon is quite distant, that doesn't mean it's far away from us. Try putting a bathroom scale on top of a 40 story building - you'll notice it's really heavy.
Myth 5. The Moon has no atmosphere. Even astronauts can tell you it's not true. High up in the Earth's atmosphere (about 100 miles away) is a layer of nitrogen, oxygen, ozone, and helium. It's a thin layer but it exists.

Geology is the study of the earth. It focuses on three main topics: natural disasters, geological history, and natural resources. Since it is the study of the earth, geology would study all of its features such as landforms, oceans, and what’s inside it.
- How long does the geology process take?
Geology can take up to 3 years to complete. For geology with meteorology as a track, geology takes up to 4 years to complete.
- What is a geology career?
A geologist works in fields such as government, research, and education.
- Who started the study of geology?
Abraham Ortelius was one of the first people to study geology. He is best known for his invention of the very first modern atlas.
- Where do geologists work?
Geologists can work in fields such as academia, consulting, and museums. There are some geologists that work in a lab and some geologists that work in the field such as oil rigs.
- What is the history of geology?
Geology is one of the oldest and most established branches of science. The field of geology was established by one of the first people to study science, Sir Isaac Newton, and others.
- How many geology professionals are there in the US?
There are over 300,000 geologists in the United States. Of that number 50% are working in consulting.
- What skills are necessary for geology?
Geology requires extreme knowledge of all of the features on the planet. These features could be small to large and can range from a few feet to tens of thousands of miles. Geology requires knowledge in earth science, geography, and sciences such as physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biology. Geologists are required to be:
- Attentive and precise in planning and executing an experiment.
- Understanding of the range of geologic processes.
- Proficiency in data analysis and logical problem solving.
- Understanding of physical geology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and many more subjects.
- What types of degrees are available in geology?
There are degrees available in geology such as bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate. A bachelor’s degree in geology is where individuals will start to learn more in-depth information on the science of geology.

Though France was not ready to sacrifice her position at the front rank of scientific nations by competing with the United States, Britain and Germany, there did emerge in the last quarter of the 19th century a succession of national scientific competitions--for example, the search for the radioactive element radium--in which workers in biology, astronomy, physics and chemistry found themselves taking on the economic and political problems of society on a much more ambitious scale. In this way, science was helping to shape the future of modern society. The 19th century also saw the emergence of new models of the institutions of science. Towards the end of that century, scientists established more than 300 institutions, most of them themselves in a state of perpetual competition. The facilities provided to such institutions by national governments and private benefactors were in these cases better and better. Meanwhile, less well-off countries such as France had to invest more in their academic schools in the hope that a solid scientific training would produce the dedicated scientists that they could use.
The final part of this story concerns the ascendancy of an international scientific culture from the end of the First World War.

According to the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the only one of the highest classification to conquer is the fact.
Who are the philosophers?
Philosophers have been philosophizing throughout history, beginning with some of our ancestors, however little they knew the current epoch.
According to the thinker Aristotle, philosophy is the love of wisdom, which he defined as the love of asking questions of all things, even what is beyond all things.
One of the most outstanding philosophers of history has always been Socrates, considered by many philosophers, including the famous philosopher Plato, his disciple as a human model.
Each philosopher has his or her own lessons, opinions, beliefs, morals and ideas. Philosophers such as Descartes, Marx, Hegel or Nietzsche have had a lot to say, but in the end they had a deep impact on human knowledge of the world, since they provided content to our philosophy, giving rise to a feeling that has lasted over time and has spread to our legacy
General Information about philosophy
The history of philosophy revolves around the knowledge of reality, both human and non-human. Philosophy is the search for the truth, but each philosophy has its own doctrine.
General ideas and beliefs form the basis of philosophy, which also helps to analyze the phenomena and reality of the human being.
The most important ideas that guide philosophers today are in the eighteenth century, with their rejection of religion and religious beliefs. Many believed that philosophers would focus on public and private self-discovery.
The philosophies that have developed since then have not needed a guru, and have focused on criticizing ideas about political power and gender equality.
In the same way, it was thought that the philosopher’s job was to find inconsistencies in accepted ideas, but their influence has been so great that the philosopher, has had a greater impact than politicians, researchers and other people, as he has always intervened in political decisions.",378,4,2002

The mistakes are attributable to the indecisive actions of the archon Heliaedes which ended up costing the death of several Persian soldiers. It has been argued that there is the possibility for an individual to change history if such an individual possesses a desire or a will to change history. Many think that there might be possible chances where a person who participated in the battle might be able to implement any event in order to take advantage and turn history into his or her favor and in this way change history.
The Hollywood version of the story of 1997’s “Braveheart,” directed by a Scottish actor Mel Gibson, tells the story of William Wallace, a Scottish knight who fought against the English army under the leadership of Edward “Longshanks,” or King Edward I of England. Throughout this story, the audience will see the event of the Battle of Stirling Bridge and the Battle of Falkirk. Wallace leads his brave Highland Scots against the English.
There are different elements that show how the government and citizens lived in the 1800’s. The three biggest locations in all of the United States would be New York City, Washington D.C. and Chicago. In fact, these three locations were probably where almost 50% of the people in the United States live in, and that is with Chicago just about doubling the population of New York and Washington D.C. As a comparison, Boston was also probably about 20% of the United States population. Additionally, it is possible to use this same concept to divide the world in the same way. In particular, New York, Rome and China were very similar in size as these were some of the largest cities in the world and these three cities made up almost half of the world’s population. Therefore, it seems logical to create a similar model to the United States where the top three cities in the world would be New York, London and Beijing.

Conversely, the purpose of meditation can be to be less annoyed by something that is slightly annoying. The point is, a cat does not need to be ""content"" with its meditation goal, it needs to be able to be more active. In this case, being active would mean the ""cat"" was ""being"" a dog, but the goal of the meditation is to make a cat into something that is more ""doglike"" and less ""catlike"".
There is a certain use of meditation that is meant to bring about the state of ""malleability"". In this case, being malleable means being able to learn how to be more adventurous in one's life. Malleability is the ability to allow oneself to learn from mistakes. Being more adaptable, malleable and less stubborn makes one less likely to get stuck in old ways and styles. It is the ability to let go and to see things in a new light. This is what a meditation really brings about.

But in meditation, you need to think about things in a different way. Not everything in the world is of equal importance to a person. In meditation, the focus is on not thinking about certain things at all.
It seems to me that meditation is a form of meditation. It's a way of getting through life in the same way that people meditate.

1. uncovering the past: archaeology offers a glimpse into the past and allows us to understand the human civilization that existed before us. we can learn about the customs, cultures, and beliefs of past societies by studying artifacts and remains of ancient structures.

2. preserving heritage: archaeology is crucial in preserving our cultural heritage. the study of archaeology helps us understand and appreciate the different aspects of our cultural heritage that are threatened by natural disasters, looting, and modernization.

3. environmental conservation: archaeology is also important in environmental conservation. it helps identify the potential impact of development projects on natural habitats and environmental resources. this information is essential in developing sustainable policies and planning the development of our environment.

4. job creation: archaeology can create employment opportunities, especially for local communities, by conducting excavation and research projects that require skilled labor.

5. cultural understanding: archaeology encourages cross-cultural communication and understanding, which helps in resolving conflicts and promoting peace. by sharing our knowledge of the past, we can understand and respect each other's cultural diversity.

Archaeologists usually discover a wide variety of artifacts during their excavations, depending on the time period and location of the site. Here are some common types of artifacts:

1. Stone tools: These are the most common type of artifact found during excavations, and they include blades, flint chips, scrapers, and choppers. They are usually made of stone and were used for hunting, gathering, and making other essential tools.

2. Pottery: Archaeologists often find pottery during excavations, which are made of clay and were used for storing food, serving food, and other purposes. The types of pottery found depend on the time period and location of the site.

3. Jewelry: Archaeologists may find jewelry made of materials such as stone, bone, and metals. Jewelry was often worn for decorative and cultural reasons.

4. Metal objects: Archaeologists may also find metal objects such as tools, weapons, and jewelry. These can range from copper and bronze objects from the Bronze Age to iron and steel objects from more recent times.

5. Structures: Excavations often reveal buildings, walls, and other structures that provide information about the time period and the daily lives of the people",490,4,2787

Meditation has a rich history that spans several thousand years and can be traced back to various cultures and traditions. The term ""meditation"" comes from the Sanskrit word ""dhyana,"" which means ""to contemplate"" or ""to focus one's attention."" 

In ancient India, meditation was practiced as a means of connecting with the divine. Hindu scriptures, such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads, describe various forms of meditation and the benefits of maintaining a regular practice. 

In the Buddhist tradition, meditation was developed as a way to cultivate inner peace and wisdom. The Buddha himself is said to have practiced meditation for many years before reaching enlightenment. Buddhists use a variety of techniques to focus the mind, such as mindfulness, breath control, and visualization. 

Similarly, in Taoist tradition, meditation is seen as a way to connect with the natural world and achieve balance between the body and mind. Meditation is practiced in many forms, including sitting meditation, walking meditation, and visualizations.

My name is David Bodamer, and in February of 2009 I made my annual fishing trip to the North Fork of the upper Missouri River. It’s a remote place on the Rocky Mountain Front, where you do not see a human being for days. You do, however, see a lot of wildlife.
The highest quality wildlife habitat I’ve ever seen is in the vast solitude and sparse tree coverage of the Fortine, Montana, plateau. There are tree-lined draws, dense meadows with low snowbanks, and grass and rock flats covered in buffalo berries and our best known plant, the piñon pine, that flourish in the fertile soils of wind, fire, rain and sun.
The only thing we saw while we were there is the wildlife. During a late morning of rough hiking, my friend Pete Fraser and I stepped up the last draw in our search for secluded fishing holes. The earthy smell of a limestone granite wash and the meadow creek rushing through a meadow were the calling cards of spring in the wild. Soon we reached a meadow complete with an aqueduct in which six big bull elks were roaming. We stopped and watched them. I’m a birdwatcher, and Pete is a boater. In two-plus hours of waiting, not one otter, lynx, fox, coyote, mink, or bobcat came our way.

Myths are not only important due to their literary and educational value, but also due to their ability to shape and convey culture, traditions, values and morals. Theorists in the field of anthropology, comparative religions and cultural studies affirm that myths reflect a human culture’s great historical, linguistic and literary accomplishments. Therefore, to study the mythology of different cultures, we can actually have a better understanding of each society’s formation, its laws, customs and moral values.
Mythology is linked to religious beliefs, and some of the first myths were created and written as a way to explain the mysteries of the creation and the origin of the universe, the human creation and its passage from a young age, sexual differences, birth and death, the wealth, the war, the diseases, and other troubles of the human societies. Often times, myths narrate the origin of a cultural value that becomes important over time. If the god of light appears as the result of an ancestral, natural event that is repeated for some reason, the hero myth will be created as a narrating of the historical events of a particular event, as a result of which a god, super being, or natural phenomenon was created. Stories of the origin of specific animals, plants and natural phenomena are also part of some religious beliefs and practices.
Stories that have mythological significance are all over our lives. At first, every tribe of people in the world believed that its surrounding landscape or geography was animated. If there was a sudden change in the weather, there was a significant change in the way the inhabitants lived. Most of the beliefs came from the winds, sea, mountains, animals and plants, caves, rivers, fire, as well as everything else that was important to them.
No matter how small or large a group of people, they were sure that they were all interrelated. Everything was linked, and therefore, everything was part of the laws of nature, that were believed to exist in a particular way for a certain time, and then again in a different way. Each phase was an integral part of the cycle of life and death. Any new characteristic or quality that appeared in the environment or in some other way was likely the result of the intervention of the gods. The gods became as real to these people as everyday objects.
Mythology is also the most important aspect in popular culture because it reflects how any new generation has viewed the world and understood it. It represents the beliefs, values and norms",510,4,2632

Children and teens face obstacles that are a little different. As adults we see children at the park and realize that they are just starting to make the motions for some of these movements. It may not be perfectly formed, but they are doing something. A lot of adults are looking at children and wish that they could be doing some of those exercises. Learning to not do that is important.
You should respect that what they are doing is fun for them, so don't make them feel as though you are picking on them. Instead of looking at a child as if they are doing it wrong, try to find a time to just work with them. Show them what is wrong with what they are doing. There is no sense in doing jumping jacks if they are going to stand there for a second before moving their feet. Start with how to stand correctly, what muscles are involved in the movements, how to maintain form and then work from there.

A lot of seniors do pushups but they have no idea how dangerous they can be. It is important to have a chair near the pushup station. If they start getting tired, the chair is there to catch them. It is a tool to help them work safely.

You might be curious about what makes you happy, angry, and sad. You might also wonder about how you feel about someone new. How will you actually answer these questions? How can you?

Maybe you can name what kind of situation makes you angry or happy, but how do you know these are all true conditions for you? You can be surprised to find out you don’t always feel that way for a certain kind of situation. Maybe you’re angry at a friend who’s just upset, but you’d try to cheer him up instead.

Naturally, you might wonder about the conditions that get you angry and happy, for example:

• How would you change your initial judgement if you suddenly faced a new situation?

• What makes you angry?

• What makes you happy?

• How do you express those feelings?

There are also some more general questions you might ask:

• Why does A lead to B?

• What are all of the reasons (causes) for C?

• What are the reasons (causes) for X happening?

These questions are referred to as causality questions because they involve exploring which conditions cause outcomes.

Why is this important?

Neuroscience has a lot of information to offer about these issues.

For example, much of how you feel is related to how you perceive the outside world. The way we see it shapes what we think and feel. Have you ever felt something was “cold”? It turns out the cold feeling has to do with the temperature receptors in our body. If you’re interested, you can check out Ilya Prigogine’s and Isabelle Stengers’s Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Part 1, if you’re curious about how you can tell the temperature apart using biology.

There are many important causal questions (questions about why), but there are also problems like choosing between two options or forming an intention. In addition to understanding why things happen (which is useful for planning), we also have to know how to choose between them. Instead of telling you how you should deal with it, I’ll give you the cognitive ability to make your own choice.

In Neuroscience from first principles, we will discuss causality questions in both individual and group settings. We’ll start by understanding why you made a particular choice by focusing on the motion of points on a square grid. That’s in Chapter 1 and 2. We will also dive into different mechanisms in your brain that give you a sense of pain, see colors, and remember sensory information.

Part of what makes sociology so appealing as an academic discipline is the space it occupies on the map of the social sciences. The contours of the discipline are well defined, but this does not mean that the sociologist has every answer.
We find sociological perspectives, categories, and theories used across the social sciences to reveal new insights into a wide range of social phenomena. And, with all these perspectives interacting with other perspectives, we see the connections between sociology and such fields as economics, political science, and geography.
Along with ethnographic techniques and other qualitative methodologies, the historical and theoretical perspective are the tools that have been applied most widely.
Do not for a moment think this is easy work. How to apply sociology requires making sense of a disparate field of research, research processes, and perspectives, all based on the specific findings of a particular study. And you want to do that without diluting the insights of sociology, losing sight of its concerns, or working counter to its overall aims.
One of the reasons the study of how the social sciences connect with sociology has been a logical place to start is that sociology and economics have been closely tied. Political economy is a fundamental part of the history of both disciplines.
Sociology and economics have in fact much in common. In the broadest terms, the differences between sociological and economic approaches can be seen as regarding the role of history in the development of human societies, the role played by culture in human societies, and the degree of involvement of the agent in economics. The way they research, theorise, and learn from one another has been the result of centuries of interaction between the two fields. Few can dispute that the two approaches have helped to understand the economy, history, and society that we experience today.

Genetics is the study of genes, DNA, and how they determine traits in living organisms. Heredity is the process by which these genetic traits are passed down from parents to their offspring. In humans, genetics and heredity are responsible for determining physical characteristics such as hair color, eye color, skin tone, and height, as well as certain behavioral and cognitive traits. 

The human genome contains over 20,000 genes, which provide the instructions for building and maintaining the body's tissues and organs. These genes are inherited from parents, with one copy coming from the mother and one from the father. During sexual reproduction, each parent contributes one set of chromosomes to their offspring, which carry a unique combination of genes. 

Some genetic traits are dominant, meaning that a single copy of the gene is sufficient to express the trait, while others are recessive, meaning that two copies of the gene are required for the trait to be expressed. Dominant traits, such as blue eyes, are more common than recessive traits, such as brown eyes, which only occur when both parents pass on their brown eye gene. 

In addition to genetic traits, environmental factors such as nutrition, lifestyle, and exposure to toxins can also affect how genes are expressed and contribute to the development of certain diseases and conditions. Genetics and heredity play a significant role in human health and disease, and understanding these concepts is important in developing effective treatments and preventative measures.",291,4,1570

Professor Roberts, who became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2015, spent three months looking into our fascination with the past in a series entitled ‘Time Makers’, starting on BBC Two on Tuesday.
The programme was inspired by the reconstruction of Richard III’s skeleton in 2013, which grabbed the nation’s attention.
Roberts meets those who have spent years obsessively trying to recreate the past for their TV shows.
But she also looks at how everyday people in the present are constantly engaging with the past – from a radio show featuring music from medieval times to a 1920s-themed village in Cornwall.
Roberts said: “The idea for the series came from the remarkable story of Richard III’s skeleton.
A team of 10 scientists, including Professor Roberts, spent over five years using 3D technology and human DNA to reconstruct the skeleton.
At the opening event to the session of one of the oldest salt fairs in Britain – the Morleyville Salt Fayre – Alice Roberts said the two-day event, taking place on Sunday, September 30 and Monday, October 1, was the perfect opportunity to discuss how the event, now in its 636th year, has evolved.
“The Salt Fayre is a great example of being rooted in the past while also looking to the future,” she said.
“It’s a wonderful occasion to bring together and celebrate our rich history.
The Fayre’s Director Paul Allott said: “It’s the perfect environment for deep knowledge sharing, new research or the sharing of new ideas.
“But it’s also a place where “general interest” history can be enjoyed, so that an important topic like the significance of salt can be brought to life.
The Salt Fayre was first held in 1383 and is now the oldest event of its kind. Visitors flock to the popular mid-Summer Fayre from across the country – and further afield.
It is said by locals to have been first held in 1383 at “Galmpton’s Cross” after William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, granted a market at Morley because the Morley chapel was ‘exceedingly empty’.

Upgrade to sustainable materials. With better air filtration and other home technologies, people tend to stay inside more than they used to. This means less fresh air or exposure to natural light. It may also mean exposure to more allergens that affect your body. Plus, rising energy costs mean you're using more and more power to heat and cool your home. Modern architects can help you plan a sustainable renovation that will reduce your impact on the environment while also improving your health and saving you money over the long haul.
Think open spaces. Consumers like to mix and match in the kitchen. Instead of the traditional arrangement of counters and appliances off to one side of the room, counters can be arranged on either side of the sink, including a kitchen island where people can stand and talk to each other. The open layout also allows guests to mingle with the host. It's a nice effect that makes good sense. You can leave this in place as an open work area. You can also give the whole room a redo with changes to the flooring, lighting, and storage.
Add a bathroom. This is a wonderful addition in a remodeling project, allowing you to make a powder room in a public area or a luxury bathroom suite that the entire family will enjoy. By choosing a location and fixtures thoughtfully, you can create the room that feels most comfortable to the family.

Vedavarta presents a presentation exploring the use of the Simple Devices tools for teaching students and staff alike in academic institutions. In particular, this presentation focuses on how the poems and writers themselves have had a significant impact on student learning. References The presenter references the work of Royce and Kamii, [3] and as with all Simple Devices videos, uses real students and teachers in the local community for illustrative purposes, not real names.
Tong and Aroonthong, [4] speak of Education as Change in terms of practical application. English Literacy teachers saw the addition of poetry into curriculum in terms of three functions: empathy, resistance, and agency. The resistance function is a challenge to standard structures, particularly the patriarchal conditions endemic in education.
The change of the institution brought about by writing about the authority of “God and King” that is the “depriment” of the lesson was realised by teachers as directly linking to language required for engaging in politics to overthrow such institutions, even beyond the Putsch attempt of the Burmese students. This is supported by Royce and Kamii, [3] in their identification of an imperative to making literary students “freer to speak”, “to live” and to communicate in new ways.
Furthermore, through a series of focused reading and writing exercises, students came to learn that poetry not only provides a forum in which they may question the very source of all morality in language, but also “poems,” per se, are ways in which they can access thoughts that are theirs, where they feel secure enough to let other people know their “most private truth,” the demonstration that others can hold those “private truths” in their own languages and comprehension is itself a step forward for learners that will support future efforts in world Englishes. [5]
A similar, albeit explicitly political use of poetry in education is in the way that Poems Poems Poems [6] encouraged students to become authors of their experience, increasing autonomy, participatory learning and giving a literal voice to their experience of current political issues.
That is, students were not merely presented with new language for understanding experience, they had the opportunity to employ what they knew of their experience in language into their reading, developing the ability to take in new meaning through access to more refined language in the poems being studied.

Cinema, or motion pictures, is one of the most popular forms of entertainment around the world. The history of cinema can be traced back to the late 19th century, with the development of the first ""projector"" capable of projecting still photographs in motion. This allowed for the creation of moving images that could be viewed by the public.

In the early 1900s, movies were primarily viewed in movie theaters. These early movies were silent and often very short, with a run time of only a few minutes. Early movie theaters were often small and cramped, with only a few seats and no air conditioning. The films were shown in black and white, and the sound was provided by ""nickelodeons,"" which were small, cheap theaters that would have live pianists or other performers to provide live accompaniment to the film.

The 1920s saw the rise of Hollywood, which became the dominant force in the film industry. Studios like Warner Bros. and MGM began to produce larger-budget films with A-list actors and directors. The invention of sound in movies in 1927 revolutionized the industry, with the introduction of talkies. This allowed for actors to speak and dialogue to be included in films, leading to an increase in popularity and profitability.

In the 1930s, Hollywood produced some of its most famous films, including ""King Kong"" and ""The Wizard of Oz."" The end of World War II in 1945 brought about a renewed sense of optimism and prosperity, which led to an increase in spending on movies. Studios began to produce more ambitious films, often with large budgets and famous stars.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of new filmmaking techniques, such as the use of special effects and color, and the popularity of foreign films from countries like Italy and France. In the 1980s and 1990s, the rise of cable television and home video led to a decrease in the number of people going to movie theaters. However, this also allowed for a greater diversity of films to be produced and released.

In recent years, the rise of streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu has challenged the dominance of traditional movie studios. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on the industry, with many theaters closed and a shift toward streaming releases of films.

In the spring of 2004 the Georgia Department of Education began awarding grades to public schools. These grades are based on a student’s academic achievement as measured by standardized tests and graduation rates. Not surprisingly, more than 80 percent of these grades were in the ‘D’ and ‘F’ ranges.
Some of the other student performance indicators used by the state were Georgia Writing Test results, the Pre-ETS ACT results and the Percentage of Students Meeting 4th Grade Reading Proficiency Standards. Of these, the 4th grade results were considered the most telling. On these tests it became apparent that Georgia’s elementary school students were just not up to the task of reading properly. These children read so slowly that by the time the poor readers were over the age of 11 they would have to learn to read for the rest of their lives.
Based on these test results, Georgia made the decision to drastically reduce the amount of reading and writing they required at the elementary level. Georgia’s Department of Education believes this will produce more proficient readers in the future.
As an educator, I would argue that elementary teachers already do an excellent job with their students. I believe it is far more likely that the problems are not with the elementary teachers, rather it is likely that there is too much reading and writing being done for children who simply are not interested.
The other factors most often ignored in these studies are motivation and effort. In the 8th grade, the world begins closing in on these students; they find they have to do their own laundry, clean up their own rooms and change out of their own clothes. They have to complete their homework, take the PSAT and ACT and carry their own books, laptops and Ipods to and from school. Everything becomes the responsibility of the student and they hate this! As students become older they get less and less reading done in school because they don’t have to. The average Georgia eighth grader has 1.5 books to read over the summer and 90 percent of Georgia eighth graders say they would rather visit the dentist than do that.
High school seniors feel that they have paid their dues. Many often express a wish to read a novel for pleasure when in the future. They could, but they don’t. They have so many things on their mind right now, all they want to do is complete high school. It’s hard to get a child to focus on a book when he or she is contemplating dropping out of school.

Sure! Robotics is the study and use of robots, which are machines that can move and interact with the environment around them. Robots can be used in a variety of applications, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and entertainment.

Robots can be categorized into several main types, including:

1. Industrial robots: These robots are used in manufacturing and assembly line settings to perform tasks such as welding, painting, and packaging. They are typically large and heavy, and are designed to work long hours without human intervention.
2. Service robots: These robots are designed to assist humans with tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and healthcare. Examples include robotic vacuum cleaners, domestic helpers, and nursing care robots.
3. Military robots: These robots are used by the military for a variety of purposes, including reconnaissance, bomb disposal, and even combat.
4. Entertainment robots: These robots are designed to provide entertainment or amusement to humans, such as robotic pets, animatronics, and robotic shows.
5. Personal robots: These robots are designed to be used by individuals for tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and companionship.

Each type of robot has its own unique characteristics and capabilities, and is designed to meet specific needs in a particular context.

Now, can you explain how they work using image processing and some implementation example?
Sure! Image processing is a key component of robotics, as it allows robots to gather and analyze visual information from their surroundings. There are several ways that robots can use image processing to navigate and interact with the world around them:

1. Computer vision: This involves training a robot to interpret and understand visual data using techniques such as image recognition and object detection. For example, a robot might use computer vision to identify obstacles in its path and avoid them.
2. Tracking: This involves using image processing to follow a moving object or track a specific pattern over time. For example, a robot might use tracking to follow a person's face or track the movement of an object.
3. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM): This involves using image processing to create a 3D map of a robot's environment, allowing it to navigate and avoid obstacles in real time.
4. Object manipulation: This involves using image processing to identify and manipulate specific objects in the robot's environment. For example, a robot might use object manipulation to pick up and move a specific item.

Here is an example of how a robot can use image processing to navigate and interact with its environment:

Some of China's well-known developments, such as the West Lake Lake Circulation Project in Hangzhou and the Pearl River Delta Water Division and Water Treatment Project, are based on oceanography.
""The ocean geophysical environment and its hydrological environment are closely related to the progress of water and resource production,"" said Song Jian, director general of China's oceanography research.
In his view, oceanography is the major scientific support for maritime environmental and resource production as well as for maritime trade.
""The ocean covers an area of 361 million square kilometers and is a rich source of energy. But it is also a volatile area in which the environment is constantly changing,"" said Song.

For learning robotics it's always good to start from first principles: from motion of particles, particles aggregating and pushing to the creation of thin films, to creations of simple robots (eg. wheels, springs, pulleys, beams) and finally the concept of automata and simple robots or even intelligent robots.

Principles of Robots

Principles from constructing a LEGO® robot: (a) bracing (b) constraints (c) kinematics of compound linkage (d) case study (a working, stackable, invertible robot)

(This is a good article on motion principles used by LEGO® robots. Explore and reinforce robotics principles through fun activities.)

1. Kinematics of motion of particles: derive by viewing 2D and 3D motion from a center of mass coordinate system.

2. Kinematics of particles pushing or pulling: from Newton's law of motion.

3. Robotics basics: man-made machines and machines moving in complex ways are called robots. Here are some popular types of robots: industrial robots, desktop robots, service robots, military robots, and exploratory robots. Despite a variety of robots, they can be broadly divided into two types: manipulators and walkers. Manipulators that can only push or pull are called mecanum wheeled robots. A wheeled robot can only wheel by pushing straight then turning. In contrast, a crawler is a robot with wheels in its arms, so the wheeled robot looks like a crawler. Legged robots may use rollers or paws.

4. Control design for manipulators and crawlers: inverting the Lagrangean $L=\frac{m}{2}v^2-\sum_i P_i(x_i)$ for a crawler moving on a flat terrain.

5. Linear system / system of ODEs: a system of equations that define the relationships between the state variables.

6. System identification: the task of finding the mathematical formula that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs of a given system.

7. Control system for mass-spring system: a system of $m$ particles on the surface of a body can be solved by solving the motion of $m$ particles in parallel with a body-fixed coordinate system, especially for a planar body in $2D$. A simple manipulator has $m=2$ and thus has only two state variables. A flexible manipulator is a manipulator that moves by changing length of flexible parts (muscles, tendons or chains). In general, a flexible manipulator has $m=6",540,4,2314

It is now even more difficult to have confidence in those innovations that are properly assessed and ideally, find a compromise for small clinical effect with low cost or safety of procedure (eg high pain thresholds, limited technical requirements, and no need for expensive equipment). Today, nurses and social workers are seen as significant partners in biomedical research, and our research findings go through independent peer review, either in the traditional way or with the growing popularization of online-based publishing services. Additionally, doctors are encouraged to engage in research with recommendations that would ensure the transfer of knowledge generated in the laboratory to the practice of medicine. In these ways, new techniques, devices and services can be introduced more easily to the benefit of patients, nurses and doctors alike. Nursing and Allied Health Reports (NAHR) is an open access, online-only journal. The mandate of NAHR is to encourage the submission and publication of high quality original manuscripts in the area of nursing and allied health, with a particular emphasis on the implications for patient care. This Journal will provide researchers, educators, practitioners and policymakers with access to a broad and balanced picture of current knowledge, attitudes and practices in relevant fields. This Journal will encourage readers to share their experiences and educate their colleagues.
Publications need to be enhanced with summaries that convey the rationale, method, main findings and policy or practice implications. Besides, emphasis should be placed on the generalizability of results so that every nurse and healthcare professional, no matter their country, specialty or training level, can learn from such published work.
Researchers need to understand that a career in biomedical research requires an ability to communicate with others, ranging from peers and superiors to lay people, at all stages of a project, from design, through to execution and reporting.
Departments and administrators need to value the important role that scientists and nurse researchers play in the organization and should prioritize funding for research through appropriate committee structures that include members with expertise in research as well as a commitment to and understanding of the important goals of promoting excellence in health care and public health.

While some people may be able to name the different gods, heroes, and heroines of a culture, few are aware of how each culture’s mythology is different from one another, or how these myths might hold lessons for today. One culture that has been defined by its mythology since the beginning of its existence is Greece.
The ancient Greeks are well known for their developed mythology and ancient religious practices. Those who are able to tell the stories and define the gods and goddesses, the heroes and the heroines, sometimes become a part of the mythology themselves, as well as their offspring. The offspring of Zeus in Greek Mythology is perhaps the best example of this phenomenon.
Zeus was the king of the gods, the Greek equivalent of Roman god Jupiter. According to myth, he was a son of Cronus, who with his siblings dethroned and castrated their father, ending the tyranny of the Titans and ushering in the golden age of the Olympian gods. Zeus was given power and authority over heaven and he held power over his fellow gods, but it was said that he was also cruel, vain, vindictive, ruthless and jealous. He was therefore one of the most feared gods of the ancient Greeks, and he could also be very powerful.
Zeus’ fear of losing power to his enemies led him to choose his sons, brothers, and nephews as his vassals. The vassals were given power, authority, and support from Zeus himself. When the vassals became too powerful, however, Zeus would threaten to take away their power and support, forcing them to take actions that would maintain his power and authority.
As a result, the Greeks came to the conclusion that the gods were not always gods, but were often the offspring of Zeus or some other god. The first of these gods to be named was Perseus, the first king of Argos. Argos was the seat of Zeus, and Perseus was the son of Zeus’ youngest son, Heracles.
Perseus was also known as Heracles’ son and helped Zeus establish his rule over Argos. Perseus, like Zeus, was also a hero, but he was also a mortal. The most famous of Perseus’ feats was the founding of the City of Troy, which was supposedly done with the aid of Perseus’ mother, Medusa.

Cryptographic systems are at best useful tools, and at worst useless toys. The only justification for pursuing them is if there is a problem with something that they may be able to solve or improve.

The two most important problems that cryptography has solved are

1. the difficulty of rewriting social conventions in code in a manner that satisfies or prevents you from doing something, and

2. the difficulty of backing down an avalanche of social conventions to nothing.

Cryptography is not magic that allows you to encode information so that only you can read it (if you can solve problem 2, you can build that, but it's way easier to not build it in the first place).

[The whole purpose of this answer is to distance it from this other answer](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/1489/61), as I feel the other answer is too broad, and misses the point I want to try to make. It does not hurt to have both things here, but let's try to not mix the two.

1. Difficulties introduced by reliance on copying
-----------------------------------------------

Before the common adoption of power-law (centralized, but exponential in demand) internet connections, the amount of copies you could make of a document before realizing a printed copy almost equal to the original was very low. There were two reasons for this

1. Color profiles: Your printer probably didn't have every color combination that a device rendering your document would be able to, and
2. Ribbons were expensive. So you could not just print a bunch of identical pages, you had to decide the color of each paper in advance.

Both of those means that you couldn't make more copies than your capability to print with one color. If one copy wasn't readable, you could just print a few more before you had to do anything else. And if the generator of the copy got caught up with printing four or five more copies, that was also an opportunity for re-use to be introduced.

Now, we have a system that can be copied as easily as the original. If you could make $x$ copies of an original, at no cost, then in 60 seconds you could make as many $x/60$ copies. In four minutes you could make as many $x/240$ copies.

Is there a relatively free app for beginners that I can watch with no programming knowledge?
Don't hesitate to ask more if you need to know more about it.
Cinema 4D costs money. If you want to learn it, you should learn it. There are plenty of courses out there for Cinema 4D for free.
Cinema 4D has a freeware version which is incredibly capable.
You can use the templates and get started in no time. Go ahead and do it!
I think the tutorial here will give you plenty of information with that.
I think you should be very patient to make use of C4d as it does take time for things to sink in.
I can only share what I've learned and my subjective experience over the last couple of years.
C4D may seem to be a bit much to learn but it's really easy to start. However don't get easily discouraged if you're a slow learner, because it may require some time before you'll become proficient at it. Just a few hours into C4D you're good to start rendering.
Just as a comparison, I have been working with 3D software for the last 5 years and although I'm not proficient with all of it, I can say that Cinema 4D has the lowest learning curve and its approachable. I love the way it processes renderings as it's really quick and efficient. If you want a real-time artist, then Cinema 4D can easily be your companion, render everything and change it instantly. Adobe After Effects on the other hand is a beast. I haven't used After Effects for a while now and I will probably never change it to go back to it, because I find a lot of the features redundant.

One astronomer namely Galileo spent many years studying and observing the planets Jupiter and Saturn. With the help of the telescope, he was able to see that there were moons revolving around Jupiter and smaller moons revolving around Saturn. These observations clearly showed that they were planets in their own right. In fact, the moons around Saturn were the largest moon that a planet had ever been known to have. The planets and their moons helped to solidify that our solar system had eight planets and no more than eight. The next step was to begin to find new worlds beyond the Earth, but astronomers had to understand first that the universe had more than just the eight planets. Now astronomy was able to see galaxies outside of our own solar system. With the help of new telescopes scientists were able to realize how large and how much there was to our universe and how small the Earth was compared to that. As technology advanced, astronomers were able to view many more stars and other things that are outside of the solar system.
In April of 1845, Huggins began to view the spectra of two stars known as Theta Cygni and Mu Cephei. This was the first time that astronomers had been able to view spectra of the stars and it was quite possibly one of the greatest discoveries of the 1800s. Since that time, astronomers have continuously been able to study and measure the spectra of other objects. The spectra have varied from heat signatures to chemical signatures. These are some of the characteristics that help us to understand the various different elements that are being used and how those elements may be working together to create the atmosphere that we live in. Spectroscopy works by passing light through different substances. The light will then be separated into its various wavelengths and allows astronomers to see and recognize which elements are being used. The element uses will then allow scientists to determine how the elements are being used and it helps them to study the sun and the various elements that are coming together to make life on Earth possible.
With the help of spectroscopy, astronomers have been able to understand the universe as never before. They now know that the universe is more than just our solar system. They have determined that the universe has more than just the eight planets that have been known to exist. They have found out the various different elements that are being used and how they interact with each other. They can also take a look at the atoms",496,4,2658

Fashion is simply defined as that aspect of human personality which is concerned with dressing, ornamentation, and fashion.
Fashions change every year. Since the very early times, fashion has been an integral part of all our lives. However, there has been a remarkable difference between fashions of medieval period and modern days. The medieval age was marked by long flowing hair that were uncut as well as the horned helmet. The cloth used to make clothes in medieval era was preferably made from sheepskin and cattle leather. Not all people could afford expensive clothes at that time. But, since times have changed, and now human beings can afford almost anything.
The 21st century has witnessed extreme development in this domain and there are such brands who not only sponsor games or politics but also fashion.
The scope of fashion designing is global and at the same time every country has its own style of fashioning. In developed countries, fashion has been in existence since the early era but now more and more fashion influencers have come forward and they are responsible for invention of new trends for the upcoming days.
To be or not to be a fashion designer is the question that many people often ponder over; there is a wide difference between being fashion designer and be able to sell your designs, of course both the options involve profession but on the other hand, there is a difference in the way the process of creating the design is dealt in both cases.
To become a successful fashion designer and to have great team then it is absolutely required that you are a fashion savvy. You need to be well aware of the fashion industry of today. Keep your eyes on the latest trends because the fashion world changes very fast and the designer needs to be well informed on it. Fashion designers have to stay in touch with the field of fashion through reading news and watching television.
Fashion designing is one of the lucrative fields in today’s world. The field has infinite scope, and there is always room for new ideas and designs. Fashion designers are well paid for their hard work. You need to be well equipped with software and designing tools to excel in this field. Fashion designing is a creative field, and it is not possible to complete your diploma in three years as they might help you become an assistant designer, but to set your name as a fashion designer, you need to pursue higher studies.

Exploring some of these misconceptions will help you to have informed conversations with health care professionals in order to get the best outcomes for your child and help them to do and be as much as possible.
Let's start with the two most common questions.
Can music therapy stop tantrums and improve social skills in children with autism and ADHD?
No.
Music therapy is not a magic bullet for anxiety and worry in children. Nor is it a catch-all cure for the many other social, emotional, sensory or behavioural issues children with autism and ADHD can experience.
Music therapy is not a replacement or replacement for medications prescribed by paediatricians or specialists, nor is it a substitute for other therapies like physiotherapy or occupational therapy.
Children with autism and ADHD can still receive medication as prescribed by a paediatrician, and will have access to other therapies such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy. These other therapies and medication often help these children manage and adapt to problems related to their diagnosis better. For some children, these therapies can make significant impacts in their quality of life and create benefits for their family, both emotionally and in reducing the intensity of the symptoms they experience.
In the same way, for some children, music therapy may be a useful adjunct or complementary option to help manage difficulties, but for most children other therapies will need to be continued. And the benefits of music therapy will depend on the age and individual characteristics of each child.
Can music therapy help my child?
Yes.
As mentioned above, music therapy is not a magic bullet. Music therapy will not be a perfect or perfect fit for all children. But for most children with autism and ADHD, they will be able to find some benefits from music therapy that can have impacts on the safety, independence and emotional well-being of their family.
For children with autism, music therapy can be a way to manage stress and tension, and can support the development of the social and communication skills that they struggle with. For children with ADHD, music therapy can help to manage and reduce the symptoms of their inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. For parents, having access to high quality time with their children that is specifically designed to reduce stress and build confidence can have a significant impact on their relationship with their children. Parents can learn positive strategies to support their children's development,",548,4,2810

As a photographer, I get calls a lot from people asking for advice on how to use their new camera. Inevitably, they show me some pictures and invariably they are blurry. When I ask them how they set the camera and what shooting mode they were using, 90% of the time they have no idea. When I remind them to switch it to manual mode, I hear, ""Oh! That's how you do it.""
Blurred images are obviously not the only problem when it comes to good photographs. I get a lot of complaints from people who say, ""I was under the impression that it takes a great camera to take good pictures. So I bought a nice camera and I still don't know what I'm doing."" My simple reply is, ""You get what you pay for."" A $4000 camera is not going to improve your photography skills. However, a $400 camera is.
Another thing I hear often is, ""But I don't like the same kind of pictures as the ones in the instruction manual, so I don't know how to use it."" Shooting in Aperture mode is the easiest mode to adjust because it is the most basic mode. You tell the camera how you want the subject to be in focus and the rest of the image is left to whatever is happening to be in focus. This means your depth of field (focus area) can be anything from shallow, to very deep. Shallow focus means most everything will be out of focus; very deep focus means almost everything in the scene will be in focus, from the near foreground to the far background. Changing the apertures is the subject of another article, but by getting more comfortable with adjusting apertures you can begin to shoot much more dynamically.
But you may say, ""but, ""None of the buttons are marked for f/1.4!"" Well, that's because it doesn't matter what f-stop you are at. Aperture mode is so named because the aperture is set so it determines the width of the opening. This determines the amount of light that gets through and therefore determines the exposure. Most cameras have 5 or 6 ""a\perture settings"" (f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16). What happens is that the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to compensate for the aperture setting. This means that the shutter speed can vary from 1/2",510,4,2153

The Boston University in 2007 performed brain studies on football players. The studies revealed that many of them suffered from early Alzheimer’s and dementia.
In 2002, it was discovered that children who suffer from ADHD have less iron in the brain. It is the extra iron that fuels impulsive behavior, high blood pressure and hyperactivity. 2005 found that adults also had less iron. This led to experimental drugs being developed to treat ADHD.
Studies have also shown that people are more receptive when listening to music because it lights up the auditory cortex of the brain.
Neuroscientists have claimed that humans make decisions in 500 milliseconds. Many people find this quite shocking because most decisions take much longer than that. However, it is believed that men process information faster than women.

Many of us don’t make eye contact with people in real life because we prefer to remain on the lookout for danger. However, on the internet we have more people to befriend. In real life, we are also exposed to stressors such as politics and racism. On the internet, none of these factors are present.

1929,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Political scientists have tried to explain how politics works, the process of policy development and the decisions made by government through frameworks such as rational action theory. According to this approach, politicians and government make decisions using rational calculations of cost and benefits. However, rational action theorists have noted several problems with the use of rational choice theory in explaining the political process. 

Question: How do politicians make decisions?
Politicians typically make decisions using rational choice theory, which involves identifying an objective, evaluating the alternative courses of action, and then executing the most rational course of action, based on cost-benefit analysis[3]. It is often difficult to assess politicians’ rationality, as many of their decisions will be based on emotional responses, known as heuristics, which can produce sometimes extreme results[4]. Additionally, many politicians will engage in risk averse, incremental policies, which can prevent significant reform[5].",185,4,1049

For developers and managers who want to encourage new ideas and innovations from their AI engineers, growth should not be defined by traditional methods of assessing learning, certification, and testing. That’s where MOOC, short for Massive Open Online Courses come in. These online courses provide an opportunity for individuals of different expertise levels to learn about and develop new machine learning and AI skills.
Recreational content has come a long way. Many individuals don’t see it as content at all, but rather, a side note on a website. However, there is definitely a strong connection between pages, games, and articles. Like companies like League of Legends, not everyone likes to play games, so the article format is certainly not for everyone. However, game-style challenges and tutorials do provide some sort of entertainment for people who are not interested in playing the games themselves.
For quite some time, organizations within the cybersecurity space have actually been incorporating machine learning into their analytics strategy to detect malware and attack patterns. These days, many organizations are reaching out to analytics experts to detect malicious sites, content, and techniques. By teaching existing users how to identify behaviors and characteristics of non-organic activity, and how to go about detecting these activities through domain names, IP addresses, and URL patterns, we see organizations finding ways to improve their current system.
With many countries, markets, and industry segments taking a substantial hit from disruptions and disruption patterns, we are seeing that everyone is looking to machine learning for immediate and sometimes unexpected solutions. Machine learning provides us with analysis of real-time information which is instantaneous compared to strategies that require months or years of complex analysis. By analyzing cyber threats in real-time, from systems, endpoints, and other servers and machines, we see that these patterns are helping to better secure data, information, and asset-based infrastructure.
Although algorithms can provide a quick understanding of activity, they can also miss behaviors which are not typically seen, or noticed. Because there are a great number of ways that the same algorithm can be constructed, or executed, it is important to recognize the need for an added level of detail to a model. In this way, we don’t have to simply rely on analytics to protect sensitive data and information. We can use behavioral pattern matching to detect and capture any threats which may not be caught through other analytics techniques.
As we learn about the capabilities of machine learning through new opportunities and ways of thinking, we see that organizations are increasingly using natural language processing techniques",526,4,2927

I do not have personal experiences, feelings, or emotions. i am unable to provide an opinion or comment. however, i can give you an informative answer based on the data available in my database.

dance has been a vital form of human expression and art for thousands of years. there are many ancient civilizations that have left a significant impact on the world of dance, such as greece, rome, china, egypt, india, and many more. each culture has their unique dance traditions, techniques, and styles, resulting in a diverse range of dance genres.

ancient greek dance was characterized by its circular movements and hand gestures, which symbolized the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. the romans, on the other hand, emphasized athletic movements and rhythmic drills. egyptian dance focused on a combination of music, dance, and storytelling, portraying the ancient egyptian culture.

india's dance history is extensive, with many significant styles, including bharatanatyam, kathakali, kathak, and odissi, to name a few. these styles are distinctive in their choreography and cultural expressions.

in china, the tang dynasty's music and dance evolved to include a mix of folk, classical, and ballet genres. during the same period, the japanese thought to have created their own dance form called kabuki.

throughout history, many events and movements have influenced dance, including the emergence of modern dance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. artists such as george balanchine, martha graham, alvin ailey, and many more revolutionized the modern dance movement, creating new techniques, styles, and choreography.

in conclusion, dance has played an essential role in human expression and culture throughout history. different styles, techniques, and events have all contributed to its continued evolution. from ancient civilizations to the present day, dance continues to inspire and captivate people around the world.

Thanks for the informative response! Could you please provide me with more details about the origins of ballet and its evolution over time? Certainly! Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century, where it was first performed as a courtly entertainment. The dance forms used in ballet were stylized and formalized during the 17th century and became increasingly sophisticated, with the introduction of the ballet pantomime by French dramatist Jean-Baptiste",480,4,2506

At AWS re:Invent, the annual conference for AWS partners and customers, AWS demonstrated that the answers to questions about where enterprise computing is going are found within the cloud.
Just to recap, in the month before re:Invent, the container market in general and AWS’ Kinesis Service specifically went through some evolution. The Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose services were made generally available. Firehose can collect data from services such as AWS Kinesis Stream and Amazon S3.
Kinesis lets you collect and analyze streaming data from a wide variety of sources. It’s a common scenario to ingest large streams of new data at high rates. Firehose allows you to easily get the most out of these data sources without having to build out the underlying infrastructure yourself.
Whereas streaming data was once used for popular event and website analytics, now, with services like Kinesis, machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be applied to it. With Firehose, you can integrate streaming data with your ML/AI systems in the cloud or on-premises for just a small fraction of the development and operational work, but with far greater productivity. At re:Invent 2018 AWS demonstrated just this use case.
In addition to the aforementioned stream data being used by Kinesis Service and Firehose, it is used to send data to the next generation of Amazon Aurora Database Service, which supports multi-node clusters to scale horizontally. Being able to read each node of the cluster simultaneously allows even greater performance benefits.

As a future generation, we have witnessed and experienced a tremendous transformation in technology over the past few decades. From the invention of the transistor and the microprocessor, to the advent of the internet and smartphones, technology has played a significant role in shaping our society.

In the future, we can only imagine what new technologies will emerge and how they will impact our lives. One major area of focus will be the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have the potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare and education to transportation and manufacturing.

Virtual and augmented reality will also continue to evolve, creating new opportunities for entertainment, education, and even healthcare. The rise of the internet of things (IoT) and smart homes will make our lives more comfortable, convenient, and energy-efficient.

The advancement of renewable energy technology will play a crucial role in mitigating climate change and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Autonomous vehicles and drones will transform the transportation industry, while blockchain technology will change the way we conduct financial transactions and secure data.

Overall, the future of technology will be shaped by a combination of existing technologies, emerging trends, and new innovations. As technology continues to advance, it will continue to transform our world in ways that we cannot yet imagine.

Can you explain to me how the Internet of Things (IoT) works?
Yes, I'd be happy to explain how the Internet of Things (IoT) works.

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other objects that are connected to the internet and can communicate and exchange data with each other. Each device has its own unique identifier or IP address, which allows it to communicate with other devices on the network.

IoT devices can be equipped with sensors, actuators, and other technologies that allow them to collect and exchange data with other devices. For example, a smart home thermostat can monitor the temperature in a room and adjust the heating or cooling accordingly. A smart city traffic light can adjust its timing based on the number of vehicles in the area.

The data collected by these devices is sent to a central hub or server, where it is analyzed and processed. This can be used to optimize processes, improve efficiency, and make decisions based on real-time data.

The IoT can also be used to connect people and things in new and innovative ways. For example, wearable devices can track fitness and health metrics, while connected cars can provide real-time traffic updates and collision avoidance systems.

When you expose a mundane situation, you create a profound perspective that can inspire, challenge and liberate. When you expose a difficult situation, you raise awareness that otherwise, would go unnoticed. Exposing issues of social injustice and giving voice to the voiceless, exposes people to the reality of our times.
2. Photography can awaken our identity. It can expose facets of our life that we often are not aware of or do not want to face up to. Most people, living a privileged life do not give the poor much thought. To observe such a struggle, keeps us grounded in reality. To see an uncles protruding belly, and the pain he pulls on his spine to walk, stops us from complacency. The problem of the poor is not just an issue of economics, but it is a social inequality that denies us dignity, respect and love. For example, exposing human trafficking reveals a world that is very far from the existence of most of us. It is a modern day slavery, that many of us are naive to the gravity of its extent, and numb to its impact in the lives of millions of women, men and children.
3. The courage required to document and share such a subject is heroic. For the courage to simply hold a camera, and expose the truth, is almost unheard of in a society that only accepts or frames issues that creates perceptions. Such courage that is shown by photojournalist’s such as Guy Calavas, Mira Oraibi, Joao Silva, Elias Kanchan, to name a few, is how we shape our future.
Photojournalism is not about selling images for profit, or making money, but to simply expose the truth. It is sometimes a grueling task to grab a camera and being willing to take such risks to document for others, whose voices have been silenced or are just simple, to bring them to the forefront. None of this is simple, it is hard, it is brutal and it is life changing.

It was not at all common in ancient India; it was a marginalized practice that the Buddha himself did not endorse and was regarded with suspicion. However, people knew that many things that seemed banal and unremarkable were actually quite extraordinary and therefore worthy of study and contemplation. Today, we are not so skeptical and therefore pay no mind to meditation. We believe that most human habits are just that, habits, and nothing more. We have no spiritual or metaphysical worldviews and this keeps us awake and alert. We do not have time to be meditative people, and so are not awash in the scientific and metaphysical significance of meditation. What we need is a kind of urgency that can bring us together and instill in us a greater sense of spirituality, something we are all missing.
Meditation can be an expression of a certain desire to find inner peace and tranquillity. We find ourselves in a noisy, busy world and are all consumed by a sense of purpose that we hold dear. If we are not successful at achieving our goals, we tend to seek solace in meditation and any other activities that can help us reach our goals. We tend to feel a sense of wellbeing, of self-awareness and of self-empowerment. We can feel invigorated by our successes, by our own physical and emotional strength. When we go through our day, we feel that we have gained a better understanding of the world around us. This feeling is reinforced as we get up and go about our activities. When we are happy, our energy levels rise and our self-worth is increased. We become aware of the things that can help us achieve this bliss.
In order to achieve this heightened state of happiness and self-awareness, meditation is the best way to achieve these goals. Meditation is both an activity and an attitude. Meditation is an activity as it allows us to take a step back and see the world around us from a different perspective. Meditation is an attitude as it allows us to see ourselves and the world from a more noble and enlightened point of view.
Meditation is not the only way to achieve this noble attitude, however. It can be a powerful tool that allows us to cultivate a certain approach to life and a way of looking at the world from a new point of view. Meditation is a great way to achieve this noble",517,4,2457

Heather Clifton has already gotten her grandmother to autograph her copy of an 1875 book about Cherokee history and is working on her great-grandmother's bio.
Clifton has deep family roots and will tell you stories about them in her multimedia play, ""Operas On Ancestors,"" set for this weekend at the STEAM Academy.
It's a play about resistance and perseverance. She's pulling from memories of her ancestors from a Southern community to show how their lives were woven into Cherokee and U.S. history.
""I knew when I wrote it that it would be a lot of work because I'm trying to show up as a black woman, a queer black woman, as a Native American woman and a multi-ethnic woman.""
Clifton's story spans more than 150 years, and she has been working on it for 10 years, attending museums and researching the many books, images and videos she's come across.
The half of the story we'll hear this weekend focuses on her great-great-great grandmother Hannah, who born on the trail into Cherokee Nation from Tennessee, and her father Moses who led a group of former slaves down the Trail of Tears in 1838.
""I'm essentially my great-great-great grandmother and part of my great grandfather who was born in the 1960s,"" said Clifton. ""I'm performing on both sides of those two generations of my heritage.""
A new twist in her play comes from reading books about African Americans in the Cherokee Nation in the 1800s. It is clear that African Americans, Cherokee and European Americans loved each other, were close, but were not always integrated into the social life or politics. ""It's about relationship,"" said Clifton, ""it's not an agenda.""
Hannah and her sister Imelda were owned by two white women who hired out their children to work in households of other white families. Hannah married into a large mixed-race family who helped to take her father's remaining clan members to Indian Territory in Oklahoma.
She was a midwife and healer, and she used some knowledge about healing that had been passed to her. Midwives were often related to practitioners of folk healing or medicine in general. Clifton's family has mostly white ancestors and has created a Medicine School so there was an oral tradition of using things from the land to heal.

Students seeking a physical oceanography degree, will take courses on the observation, data collection and analysis of waves, currents and ocean temperatures. This data is then used to predict the future course and intensity of these tidal elements. Oceanographers at colleges in the United States, as well as developing countries around the world, are often consulted before large-scale dam construction projects or oceanographic dredging are considered. Without these oceanographers, mankind might not be able to adapt to the rapidly changing environment.
Mapping of the ocean floor begins with physical oceanography, which describes and predicts the behavior of the currents that shape the ocean bottom. Mapping is then used to discover sunken ships, for example, as well as for discovering land masses such as new continents. Oceanographers are often consulted before any coastal city decides to dredge the ocean floor in search of land for development.
A physical oceanography degree is most relevant to those who desire a career as a professional oceanographer. Scientific data on tides and currents are invaluable to those who study fisheries, other marine biologists, and even marine archaeologists. Employment as a marine biologist is much more common, and typically students with degrees in physical oceanography are highly trained in research, collecting and interpreting data.",336,4,1851

The basic characteristic feature of ecotoxicology is:
• It relates to organisms existing in a given ecological niche of different kinds: from prokaryotes to metazoa
• It includes all endogeneous ecological factors: catabolic pathway expressions and all indogenous processes of metabolism, etc.
• It relates to all physico-chemical factors of technological processes and the species of environmental pollutants
• It is mainly observational/ecological and limited for quantitative chemical methods
Water pollution protection method – removal of pollutant from water to allow effective utilization of waste and, in the case of hazardous chemical pollution – detoxication for safe disposal.
The most important features of environmental water quality is based on modeling. In ecological factors, such chemical pollution must be modeled by general approaches and, even on limited scales, wastewater characteristics, such as activity, composition, structure and toxicity are described.
Thus, the current areas of research in the water quality, related to the industrial pollution, are still:
• Relationship between water quality and production processes
• Assessment of risk of different processes
• Toxicological hazard assessment of industrial waste water
• Source tracking
• Remediation technologies
• Risk analysis for food chain safety.
Source tracking - attribution of toxicity of waste waters by identification of gene structure

The pollutant, in its biochemical structure, is represented by DNA, RNA, amino acids and proteins. The genetic features of certain bacteria or fungi can be found in plant and animal tissues. So the detection of gene belongs to individual trait, and is of paramount importance in tracing the pathogenesis and biological communities of unknown bacteria and microbial communities of animals.
The development of ecotoxicology in recent years is linked to the importance of numerous studies in the area of mapping pollutants of the environment, research into the toxicological characteristics of complex of pollutants and toxicity assessment and measurement procedures, quantitative extrapolation of genotoxic effects on the human organism and risk assessment of human health.
During this year, a large number of investigations have been conducted in pollution assessment and measurement processes; it is related to:

1947,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," can be overwhelming for anyone new to the field. Understanding the key components of sociology enables you to best understand the world around you.
Studying the many branches of sociology can be daunting for newcomers. It is a field that deals with general ideas and concepts, such as emotions, social change, and sociology of development and family.
The interpretation of sociology depends on the level of knowledge one has. For example, someone who does not understand the term ethnic identity cannot apply it to his or her everyday life. When someone uses sociology as a way to understand their everyday life, they look to elements of the sociology framework in order to make sense of the world.
The study of sociology can explain what happens between different people. Sociology focuses on the relationships between people that exist in the same social space. The relationships that exist among people are called social interactions. These interactions are affected by the cultures they live in.
People who study sociology look at cultures from a systems perspective. People in general are composed of different parts, such as beliefs, values, norms, values, and habits. These different parts of culture are different from the people who live in that culture. When a person interprets sociology, he or she considers the strengths and weaknesses of each culture, how each group or individual interacts with the others, and how the cultures influence each other.
Understanding how other people behave is central to studying sociology. When people study sociology, they look at the social forces that affect the behavior of people. These forces can include emotions, the influence of economic and social factors, and the influence of peer groups.
It can be difficult for people to understand why some people behave in certain ways. However, understanding sociology can help explain the behavior of others. When studying sociology, people look for ways to understand the way other people behave, and then they consider how those people fit into their own personal perspectives. It is important to remember that the way that people behave is determined by their culture, and what they do in their culture is shaped by their beliefs, their behavior, and their habits.
The science of sociology helps people understand how to interpret sociology. Because sociology is a science that looks at the way people think and behave, understanding sociology can be very helpful. for anyone.
People who study sociology try to understand how things work, and how different groups interact with each other. For example, if someone is studying people in a particular group, they will want to look at the different cultures of that group. These groups are formed when they meet and interact with one another.

For context
- to help with today’s lesson I want you to make a text file and type “A Beginner’s Guide to Mythology.” Then add a heading at the top that says “Explanatory Overview.”
- We just got a cool new thing on the backend of our site where teachers can ask each other questions via email. If you have a question, and I think other teachers might want to answer it, I’ll use the email feature so teachers can respond to each other.
- Have you ever been in a book club? Book clubs can be a great way to become a better reader and help each other understand what you’re reading. Our class can build this type of relationship by reading and discussing extracts from the book Mythology. We’ll start this relationship on a weekly basis by reading and summarizing select parts of the book.
3 Ways to Be a Better Reader
- When we read, we often quickly scroll ahead to see how it ends. We hurry to see what is going to happen because we’re afraid of what we will find when we keep reading.
- We should stop reading and “stop, think, think, stop.” (Jo Knowles) So, we should read a paragraph, maybe a full page or two, and then stop and think about what you just read.
- Look out for clues, details, and clues in the book, such as a character’s tone of voice.
3 ways to be better by analyzing
The idea here is that the more we focus on what we are reading, the more we can make personal connections to the words on the page. As a student or a class, it’s important for everyone to commit to the same goal, so that everyone is on the same page. A relationship is built on common ground.
How to read for understanding…
Scaffolded technique is the idea that the teacher helps the students reach a higher level of thinking (understanding) by using specific procedures and planning.
- First, teachers create expectations (like we did) to make everyone a part of the learning.
- Second, teachers give the students “high-quality models.”
- Next, you want to give the students various examples, including books, web resources, etc. This helps them come to their own solution (instead of copying the solution).
In addition to providing material to reach the understanding goal, teachers have to make sure that their students build connections. To do this, you have to ask the right questions at the right time, make important or time-saving decisions (or just have useful",524,4,2359
1950,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," is the branch of philosophy that is concerned with, broadly speaking, the theory and practice of medicine, the philosophical ideas of those studying and practicing it, as well as the evaluation of this theory. It encompasses four aspects: the theory of medicine, that is the rationale, knowledge and practice of the healing arts, also known as allopathic medicine; the ethical-philosophical aspect, the evaluation of medical ethics; epistemology, the study of the scope of medicine, including more traditional ideas of humoral medicine; and normative medicine, the study of how well medicine and therapies perform in the practical world.
The philosophy of medicine can be divided into biological and medical reductionism, which take a reductionist approach to medicine, and holistic and methodological dualism, which remain unimpressed with biomedical science as an inextricable component of medicine. The former describes the belief that knowledge of medicine can be deduced logically and clearly through the application of concrete methods while the latter does not put much credence in that methodology.
When the branch became scientifically mature in the 20th century, the scope was expanded to include the philosophical evaluation of medicine and the evaluation of the practice of medicine. Evaluation, in its broadest sense, can entail study of its efficacy, purpose, morality, and sociopolitical meanings.
Most medical school curricula in the United States teach about a philosophy of medicine.
Theories in the philosophy of science, especially the philosophy of medicine, attempt to present the goal or ideal of health, the observable results or outcomes of health. The work of phenomenological philosophers stressed the subjective experience of disease and pain. During the earlier stages of the “Third Wave” of Critical Theory, pharmacology was understood in terms of the globalization of contemporary capitalist economies, especially the introduction of state-of-the-art medicines in developing countries.
Epistemology is the study of knowledge in general.
Philosophy of psychiatry is a discipline in philosophy that investigates the nature of mental disorders, illness, and mental health. Modern psychology takes a scientific approach to examining the mind and behavior. In contrast, the philosophy of psychiatry is primarily concerned with the same topics as the general branch of philosophy of science, but aims to provide extra clarity with a view of how methods in psychiatry affect individuals and the population as a whole.

Thanks to its beautiful charm, dance was included in national and international cultural values. Dancers are the heroes of popular stories, and the actors have the best agents.
Academic studies are devoted to the various trends of dance performance.
Dance stands for something special, magic and something extremely pleasant to enjoy the passion of moving together. Remember the beauty of the Last Tango.
Dance lessons stand for a spectacular performance with the mixture of elegance, complex coordination and creativity. The efforts and practice of the dancers are obvious.
Let's take a closer look at the unique style of the Cuban dance. Ballet dancing is not enough to describe all the inimitable rhythms of the Cuban dance. A touch of Cuban people's good spirit and temperament appears to be the dancing spirit of the inhabitants of the island. Moreover, the centuries-old history of the Cuban dances reflects the cultural diversity of the old Spanish colonizers with the ""rule"" of African tribes. As a result, Cuban dances are as varied as the people in Cuba.
Many people see happiness in the Cuban dance. And that is, in fact, the essence of Cuban dances. Long years ago, when Spain tried to conquer the Caribbean islands, some groups of the soldiers were sent to Cuba to combat the African tribes. Eventually, they established a peaceful relationship with the African tribes and brought back with them African traditional dances, which gradually were combined with Spanish musical instruments. The slavery in Cuba, as well as the use of African slaves in agriculture, substantially affected the formation of Cuban music and dance. The dance traditions of the black inhabitants of Cuba were significantly characterized by some slave dance elements.
Let's take a look at some peculiarities of the Cuban dancing. The Cuban rhythm is extremely powerful and energetic. It is what in fact appears in many different musical styles. The dance ability and capabilities of the Cubans were enough to set up with other nations and the rhythm based on one of the most special dance styles. The dance becomes ever more simple and impossible to resist, especially when you step on the Caribbean soil.
There are many reasons to see happiness in the Cuban dances. Undoubtedly, Cuba is the land of happy people who equally enjoy and respect the special art of the Cuban dancing.

For remote sensors, like those in space, the requisite payload mass and power are usually most dominant, although pointing control costs also play a key role.
Progressive control is the rule and Kepler has shown that the same technology can be used to control both the first and second generation. But the economic, scientific and military forces push the cost of tracking systems to the exponential limits, so progressive control must march ever faster.
This requires space operators to take advantage of the latest developments in machine learning (ML) algorithms in order to estimate uncertainties, estimate error, realize cost savings and improve mission outcomes. More generally, it requires taking full advantage of ML to put more of the environmental and hardware data points to use, facilitating even more advanced iterative models.
For example, William Lamy, observing scientist at U.S. Naval Research Lab, summarizes his team’s Machine Learning challenges and approaches for beam pointing in optical space instruments:
“The progress in machine learning research is impressive, but there are still a number of significant challenges in applying it to real problems in space. In particular, the high-quality training data are often prohibitive for practical applications, e.g. because of the very high costs of collecting training data, their complex structures, their limited size or non-stationarity of the training data. But the most prominent issue is in the algorithmic solution: there are no commonly accepted metrics of success for machine learning algorithms to evaluate their solutions in contrast to the widely accepted (statistical) metrics, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The latter is always available for a given data set, but the evaluation of a machine learning algorithm requires, by definition, the extrapolation of the algorithm to situations and scenarios far beyond what it was developed for (aka generalization).
The field will be more explosive as the orbital deployment increases, cost reductions are continually made in key hardware and software areas, and the operational challenges migrate to new class of problems. Thus space operations face an explosive variety of challenges for machine learning and the next 10 years will be extremely exciting.
ML has already and will continue to have a substantial impact on space operations: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions will gain access to classified information about targets, and could find targets on",526,4,2859
1957,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are explored within the context of ethics in Jewish culture in a 1968 essay called ""What has Photography to say to the photographer"" by Holocaust photographer Roman Vishniac. This essay is sometimes used as a landmark in the philosophical discussion of ethics in art.
For Roman Vishniac, photography is a liberating technique. Through his photography, the photographer can make available to the public a current, shocking, or beautiful perspective on the world (a reality that is otherwise hidden from society) in contrast to ""picture-makers"" who ""soak up their material from others"". When one thinks of documentary photography, the connection to photojournalism is the norm. Being a photojournalist in the usual sense of the word—taking pictures to show what happened or to make a record of a news event — has never been the primary motivation for Vishniac in his work as a documentary photographer.
Vishniac contrasts photographers who ""sink and suffocate in surroundings they photograph and interpret"" with more ""open and active image-makers"" who will engage with society and share their perspective in the subject of the photograph. It's not about what the camera captures, it's about the photographer. Vishniac stresses the crucial role of the photographer's own consciousness while shooting, and how the photographer must interpret the setting. He stresses that the ""role of the photographer is not to trap but to show and record for the future a reality of the present.""
Vishniac's concern with how society perceives his photographs in a commercial context is a significant factor in his perspective on the relationship between photography and society. When Vishniac began his work in this area it was before the age of mass produced film and the commoditization of photography, and so it was more common for society to pay artists as valued contributors to society. With the advent of the mass use of photography in the media (i.e. news and advertising) he began to experiment with self-censorship and now he explicitly recommends avoiding the stock photographers who only create to meet the current trends (e.g. images of war, victims, etc.) that society demands.
The focus of Vishniac's essay is his conviction that the ethical aspect of photography is subjective. One must decide, for example, if the fact that a particular view of a subject may be unpleasant is enough to destroy the intent of the photographer. Vishniac's response to this dilemma is that the photographer should strive for the highest standards. Every decision that the photographer makes, including even the choice of subject",524,4,2607
1958,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," are the incorporation of biooptical techniques into ocean colour remote sensing instrumentation, both by satellite and on ocean observation platforms (Jannidis et al., 2015a), and a growing number of dedicated ocean colour studies on coastal phytoplankton biomass (e.g. Emmenegger et al., 2013; Shiller et al., 2007) and coccolithophore dynamics (e.g. Porporato et al., 2014; Tesi et al., 2014). These studies have shown that the photophysiological status of phytoplankton is strongly affected by changes in environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, nutrients). In the context of coastal areas, the changes in phytoplankton properties have a great potential for impacting other marine organisms (e.g. the foundation food web of the coastal ecosystem; Giannakourou et al., 2013), and also ocean ecosystems more broadly (e.g. Cai and Wang, 2003). One such ecological effect could be the alteration of the seasonal primary production intensity and timing of the light peak by shifts in the season of primary production (Carrie, 1995). For example, increased phytoplankton primary production, such as a result of warmer water temperature, has been detected as a positive response to increasing air temperature at the global scale (Luhar et al., 2012), with relatively few positive responses to the response of phytoplankton to warming recorded in temperate and polar regions (Shi et al., 2012). One possible explanation for these results is that phytoplankton growth in low nutrient, light-limited environments is aided by warmer water temperature in the tropics, but in mid-latitudes, changes in the season of primary production and hence shifts in the season of light penetration, favour phytoplankton growth in spring and autumn rather than in summer (Carrie, 1995).
Earth system models for the estimation of bio-optical properties of the sea surface from remote sensing measurements as well as for the simulation of primary production often use data from controlled or laboratory experiments. In the past, such experiments have been used to study the interaction of light and living biomass of phytoplankton assemblages in microcosm (Schrimpf and Dennison, 1995; Schrimpf and Miller, 1994; Spitz et",499,4,2201

Space exploration is the discovery and exploration of outer space by means of space technology. The human exploration of space began with chemically powered rockets, but space exploration went through a number of different eras spanning over a period of many decades.

A history of space exploration

We have been exploring space since the mid-1950s. The Cold War competition between the Soviet Union and the United States on who could explore space first began the space race. The United States beat the Soviet Union to the Moon and became the first nation to place astronauts on the Moon. The Soviet Union was also the first to launch spacecraft outside the Earth's orbit and to orbit a man-made spacecraft around the Earth. Though often mistakenly referred to as ""satellites,"" artificial satellites are really just unguided celestial bodies. Each of these three are milestones in space exploration, which, while evolving as the technologies develop, has begun to focus more on earth observation as a global problem.

Some of the key events and developments in the history of space exploration are:

• The discovery of rocket propulsion by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1903. Tsiolkovsky theory is one of the first theories of rocket engine performance and was part of the creation of rocket ballistics.
• 1920s: Rocketry developed by Robert Goddard.
• 1930s: Military R&D
• 1950s: First time civilians had a chance to fly to space - flights were made by the former Soviet Union's Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin. During the initial years of space exploration, space tourism was highly publicised. A space tourist was a traveller who was given a seat in a spacecraft by the owner, who also financed the entire trip.
• 1961: Yuri Gagarin becomes first human to travel in space when he made a single orbit in his Vostok 1 craft. His successful mission proved that it is possible to travel through space.
• 1962: One of the first economic projects in history - the space race was followed by a fleet of sci-fi inspired “retrofuturism” spacecraft launching towards the heavens.
• 1969: First woman to walk on the moon - and make it back to Earth was astronaut, NASA astronaut, and the first woman in space, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States.
• 1970: One of the first space",466,4,2336

Oceanography is a scientific discipline that studies the characteristics, processes, and interactions of the ocean. In simple terms, oceanography involves investigating the different layers of the ocean, their characteristics, and their impact on the Earth's climate, weather, and environment. 

Oceanography has contributed significantly to our understanding of the Earth's history and current environmental challenges. For instance, by studying sediment cores, scientists have been able to determine the Earth's climate history, including the changes that occurred during various geological periods such as the Ice Age. They have also discovered fossils and other evidence that show the evolution of marine life over time.

Similarly, oceanography has helped to understand how human activities, such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change, are affecting the world's oceans. It has revealed how these activities are causing imbalances in the ocean ecosystem and contributing to the degradation of marine habitats. 

Overall, oceanography is an essential field of study that provides critical information about the Earth's oceans and how they impact our lives. By understanding the oceans, we can take proactive measures to address environmental challenges and protect the planet's health for future generations.

It's amazing how much we've learned about the Earth's history through oceanography. Can you give me an example of a current environmental challenge that oceanography is addressing? Sure, one example of a current environmental challenge that oceanography is addressing is plastic pollution. 

Plastic pollution is a major environmental problem that is affecting the world's oceans. It is caused by the accumulation of plastic waste, which is harmful to marine life and ecosystems. Plastic debris can entangle marine animals, block their digestive tracts, and cause injuries. It can also contaminate the food chain, potentially harming human health.

To address this challenge, scientists and researchers use various methods, including oceanography, to study the extent of plastic pollution in the ocean and identify potential sources of the waste. Some oceanographers also conduct research on how plastics move through the ocean and what impact they have on marine ecosystems. 

By studying plastic pollution through oceanography, researchers can develop effective solutions to reduce plastic waste in the ocean and minimize its impact on the environment. This could include policies and regulations to reduce plastic use, more efficient waste management systems, and innovative new technologies to improve the recycling of plastics. Overall, oceanography is a vital tool for understanding and addressing environmental challenges, such as plastic pollution in the ocean.

1965,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," here and it’s all about Sous Vide. Cooking meat to perfection has never been easier using a sous vide cooker. This is an affordable device that cooks your meat without any risk of overcooking. You may be wondering what is sous vide cooking? Actually, it’s a form of modern cooking in which food is cooked in a plastic water bath, essentially vacuum-sealed, in the temperatures and times that allow it to cook as if it were cooked using much longer methods but to perfect perfection. In other words, you can simulate a slow-cooked roast by cooking it very slowly at a lower temperature. Did you know that slow-cooked meat is much more delicious than quickly cooked meat? The reason is quite simple: the fact that it’s cooked for a long time in a vacuum-tight plastic bag over a low heat. How does it work? Before being cooked sous vide, the ingredients are cooked outside the bag in some water. The typical recipe involves a solution of spices, water and/or wine (or other ingredients) that contain proteins. The liquid stays hot but doesn’t boil, causing proteins to release, and the water is sprayed into a vacuum bag and the ingredients are vacuum-sealed inside the bag. Once cooked, it’s just opened and put on your plate. But does it stay safe? Yes. sous vide does not create dangerous health threats. Because sous vide is a long, low-temperature cooking method, there is no accumulation of bacteria within the food. Many of today’s culinary adventures consist of machines that create delicious meals, which are well known and have become more mainstream. A lot of these machines have been around since the 1970s when the concept of being able to cook food in a plastic bag was invented. The demand for these machines became so great that it became a “must have” for anyone who wanted to open a restaurant. Sous vide has changed the way food is cooked and some of the machines available today have been around for more than 30 years. Why use a sous vide cooker? The answer is easy. Sous vide cooking has become one of the fastest and easiest ways to cook food that tastes great. This method was started in France in the 1970s and has gained popularity around the world. Sous vide cooking involves cooking food in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. Sous vide cooking is usually used for proteins and can be used for seafood, meat and poultry. The beauty of using this method is that there are no chemical preservatives or additives used in the cooking process.",524,4,2457

It allows gardening to stay in touch with what is going on around them and implement ideas that are going to improve their gardening skills. We are no longer living in the past, and the changes that have been made have allowed us to become more technologically advanced. There are many reasons that have happened over time and they will always be able to see how gardening and technology can work together.
One way that it has helped the gardening world is in the way that it has been able to use GPS systems to be able to find out where the plants are at any given time. This will allow them to understand where to put plants in and where to place them as well. This will allow them to choose the right plants and to know where they will be placed in the future, which is a great advantage for them to have.
Another thing that has helped is the internet. The ability to search online for information on gardening has helped the world of gardening in a lot of different ways. This will allow them to learn about how to take care of their plants and to be able to find out what they need to do to make them grow healthy.
Technologies also have helped the world of gardening by teaching people about the importance of water and nutrition. Water is essential to the plants that grow in the soil, so it is important that they know how to provide the right amount of water to the soil. The web will allow them to understand the importance of the right amount of water, which means that they can do all of these things in the future with ease.

Currently, North America dominates the market, and its dominance is expected to continue over the next few years. The U.S. in particular is a huge market for AI, and this is thanks to the government’s military spending plans. In fact, it is estimated that the country’s military budget will swell by 40% through 2024, which could well boost the AI market. Here is everything you need to know about the AI industry and its various components.
What is artificial intelligence? It is essentially a technology that gives machines the ability to learn and behave like humans. At its core, AI refers to computer systems, including hardware and software, that analyze, identify, and learn from data inputs, and can be used to automate and augment human decision making. In this article we’ll be looking at the artificial intelligence market. Here we find that the most popular way of using AI is in the form of chatbots which interact with people, and improve decision making.
How AI is Created
Artificial intelligence is based on the theory of artificial agents, with machines performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. For an artificial agent to interact with its environment, it needs to collect information. This information is categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The process of transferring artificial agent interactions to a computer data is called the artificial neural network. Neural networks can also be used to create software that can solve complex puzzles. However, neural networks do not generate a database on the internal working of an artificial agent, so cannot be said to be intelligent.
The best way to understand AI technology is to understand how human intelligence works. This will give you an idea of how artificial intelligence might come about in the near future. Human intelligence is a result of evolutionary development that started billions of years ago. We also have strong forebrain that is responsible for cognitive function and decision making. In fact, the human brain, which comprises 100 billion neurons, is considered the most complex organ in the body. Our ability to read, write, speak, and listen, as well as solve problems, is greatly attributed to the highly evolved human brain. When compared to an AI system, which makes decisions based on pre-programmed algorithms, humans can adjust to new situations and display flexibility.

One is that in American society that race is a perverted concept that has to be left at the door when you enter in clinical practice. We have to treat people as individuals and only as individuals. It is only when we treat as individuals that we get unbiased information that can give us a scientific consensus of what to do. The second idea is that race is a deeply ingrained aspect of culture, environment, and biology in ways that transcends science. They need to be left at the door, although when we are at the door, so what we have to do is leave them out of our science. So we are going to do that, but this book (in my opinion) can’t just leave them out.
.
For example, as I was reading through this book, I kept having to look back at the introduction of the different chapters to see where they introduced an idea. Sometimes it was necessary to see the discussion for these ideas to make sense in the context of the whole book. I had to go back because I would start thinking about some ideas, read the introduction to the following chapter, and wonder if they had that in mind or not. Then I had to go back and look to see if it had been introduced before. But before I go on, let me tell you about this book and my current feelings about it.
Review:
In this book, there are a lot of interesting things and some perhaps out of the box ideas. The idea of recognizing the role that race has in health disparities is definitely out of the box and is not something that is lauded or spoken of in mainstream medicine. In addition, and this is where I have to give the book credit, I can’t recall a medical book that has discussed the race itself and its differences to support its discussion of racial health disparities. More books on race and medicine focus on racism and how it is a potential cause for certain health disparities or that to make headway on understanding health disparities we need to talk about racism, which unfortunately we haven’t.
Having these different perspectives makes this book more interesting. Seeing the past and the future as well as the numerous parts of “race” that are connected in this book is indeed interesting. There are a lot of perspectives to take from this book and I want to highlight some.

Nightshade family refers to a group of plants that includes tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers. These plants have been an integral part of human cuisine for thousands of years, and have played a crucial role in the evolution of many culinary traditions. Here is a brief history of cooking with ingredients from the nightshade family:

1. Ancient times: 

The nightshade family plants were first domesticated by indigenous people in South America around 10,000 years ago. The tomato, which was previously known as the ""love apple,"" was also known as the ""tomato plant of rabbits"" because it was thought that rabbits would not eat it. As settlers migrated to other parts of the world, they began incorporating these plants into their diets, adapting them to local conditions and culinary traditions.

2. The Middle Ages: 

In the medieval era, the use of nightshade plants became more widespread in Europe. The potato, which was originally from South America, became a staple food in Europe thanks to its ability to withstand the harsh growing conditions of the continent. The tomato was also introduced during this time, but was initially mistrusted and seen as a toxic plant.

3. The Renaissance: 

During the Renaissance, the use of nightshade plants became even more prevalent in European cuisine. The tomato, which had been previously considered poisonous, became a key ingredient in many dishes. The eggplant, which had been grown for its decorative leaves, was also introduced and eventually became a staple in Mediterranean cuisine.

4. Today: 

The use of nightshade plants in cooking has continued to evolve over time, with new recipes and techniques emerging as people discover new ways to prepare and cook these plants. The nightshade family now includes more than 3,000 plant species, including peppers, tomatoes, eggplants, and potatoes. These plants continue to be used in many different cuisines around the world, from Mexican cuisine to Indian curries.

It's fascinating how much history is tied to these ingredients. Have there been any recent developments in nightshade cuisine?

As with any culinary tradition, the use of nightshade family ingredients has continued to evolve and adapt to changing tastes and trends. Here are a few recent developments in nightshade cuisine:

1. Plant-based diets: With the rise of plant-based diets and concerns about the health impacts of animal products, the use of nightshade vegetables in vegan and vegetarian cuisine has grown in popularity. For example, eggplant is used in vegan ""meat"" substitutes",525,4,2611

My wife, Nancy, is asking me why I think that this can be of such help for high school pupils, for school teachers, for all high school pupils.
She says: Shouldn’t I talk more about mathematics? Don’t I need to put into the book more of what I teach at the university?
As you may have noticed, the answer to her question is: Yes, I want to and will put more mathematics into the book. But it will be focused on certain points of mathematics and it will be motivated.

Q: Is the continuum hypothesis consistent with $ZF$?
A: No. Indeed, one can “prove” from $ZF$ that there is not a most, or minimum, number $m$ such that for every $x$ one has $x\in m$ (if such number did exist, then it would have to have the property $x\not \in m\vee x\in m$, by the classical principle of the excluded middle (LEM)).
However, by using the well-known axiom $RM$, that one can replace every set $x$ by its element, or its minimal element (namely, the least element in the set $x$), one obtains that any set $X$ must be either empty or contain at least an element.
If instead $X$ were empty, then one would have that $m = m$ and $m\in m$ – but from this it follows that $X$ has an element $m$ with $m\not\in m$ – in contradiction with $RM$!
So any set $X$ cannot be empty, and then, assuming that there is such a least number $m$, we must have that $m$ is not in $m$ (after this argument we conclude that $m\in m$ or $m\not\in m$). In the first case we would have that there is not such number $m$, in the second case we would",525,4,1993

We understand that elections are incredibly expensive, and is likely to continue to be expensive. But technology represents one of the best tools for inclusion and can enable turnout in previously disengaged voters and marginalised groups at a fraction of the cost. Elections globally have seen the number of politically active users on social media. In the 2015 US Presidential elections 67% of American people used social media and the same will happen in Nigeria 2019.
These statistics showed how the use of social media make the election part of Nigeria politics. These sites also provide a channel through which negative information can be disseminated at no cost. But to make this inclusive, platforms such as Google have tools and resources such as the Google Digital Tools, 80% of people living in Nigeria have access to internet devices (Smartphones, Tablets, PCs), including 71% of those in rural areas, and two-thirds of those in urban areas.

At Innovative Fitness Solutions, we know that our customers are looking for the best gym equipment that’s most appropriate for their needs. What we also know is that many people are slightly misguided about what equipment to buy or aren’t aware of the benefits that different pieces of equipment can provide.
We have created a checklist of some of the common misconceptions that we’ve heard and a brief rundown of why these aren’t completely true. Although there is some truth to some of them, the benefits that these gym equipment provide are worth thinking about before making a decision. Take a look at the list below:
- Cardio machines provide an effective full body workout
Every piece of gym equipment focuses on a specific part of your body, but the equipment does help you to become stronger and more agile. In some cases you might also get extra benefits by working the upper and lower parts of your body using cardio equipment, but if your fitness goal is solely toning or strengthening then you might want to look for a few machines that target your problem area.
- You should aim for the lowest weight possible
The heavier weights that you lift will result in more muscle growth. Whilst there are no target numbers that you should hit when you’re lifting, it is a good idea to ask the team at Innovative Fitness Solutions about equipment options, so that you can have the best chance to reach your goals.
- You must do cardio for at least an hour
You can only manage an hour of cardio at a time if you are trying to train for a 5k. However, if you’re looking to maintain your fitness, then you can do that in a shorter amount of time if you’re training your muscles as well as your cardiovascular system. The key with using any cardio equipment is to go at a comfortable pace. When you’re feeling like you want to give up, just focus on a simple and slower pace to push you through. Also, be sure to take your time and vary your exercises and routines so that you can see the best results.
- Gym equipment is dangerous
The gym equipment that we supply from an elite quality brand doesn’t pose any risk to you. Of course, you need to be careful when you’re using these machines because they’re powerful and need to be handled properly, but it’s a lot safer to take part in fitness classes with like-minded people, as the instructor will ensure that you and others are being safe whilst using the equipment.

During filming, you need to be fully immersed in the journey, connecting with both the animal and nature itself. When it comes to getting all the footage you want, watching, recording, and photographing animals is all in a day's work. Below are some of my favourite moments throughout our BBC productions in which I was lucky enough to be filming in beautiful locations whilst on safari.
South Africa was so diverse – from majestic herds of elephants on the plains, tracking endangered rhinos in the dappled forest, large prides of lions lying along my side of the truck, hippos laying in the water as the sun rose and all accompanied by phenomenal wildlife sounds.
All such amazing experiences and truly life-affirming times. I never would have thought in my wildest dreams that I would end up working as a Camera Operator and Presenter of wildlife programmes. My admiration for the natural world has grown ever since.
8) Jim Corbett National Park – I was following as a younger camera assistant our lead Camera Operator Gavin, who had been there many times. In the back of our jeep, we were stopped by the NDTV team crew taking photos. I was standing in the back and suddenly a Leopard ran past and disappeared amongst the bushes. I couldn't believe it, this was the first leopard I'd ever seen in real life. It was from that moment, I remember thinking this is where I want to be working – filming and experiencing such wildlife moments first-hand.
A great herdsman was filming within an African style grass area in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. I was photographing above the guides bonnet. The San Bushman was feeding some Zebras when two Acinonyx jubatus Panthera cub start feeding next to a female who appeared to be begging for her share. The photo came out brilliantly as I was able to get the perfect framing of the animal with the background and foliage. The photo shows the delicately constructed patterns on their shoulder and forehead.

Robotics has a long and interesting history in industry. The concept of robotics dates back to ancient Greek mythology, where machines were depicted as having the ability to do manual work. However, the modern history of robotics began in the 1920s when robots were used for factory automation. In the 1940s, during World War II, military robots were developed to perform tasks such as bomb disposal.

The earliest industrial robots were developed in the 1960s by companies such as Unimation, a division of General Motors, and ASEA, a Swedish company. These early robots were designed to perform simple tasks such as welding and painting, and their programming was done using punch cards.

During the 1980s, industrial robots became more sophisticated and were able to perform more complex tasks, such as picking and packing goods. As a result, the use of robotics in industry grew rapidly, and by the early 2000s, robotic systems were being used in a wide range of industries, from manufacturing to healthcare.

The impact of robotics on the global economy has been significant. As more companies adopt robotics technology, it has led to increased productivity, reduced costs, and improved safety in the workplace. This has led to increased job growth in the robotics industry, as companies invest in new technology and hire more workers to design, program, and maintain these systems.

The use of robotics in industry has also had a significant impact on the global economy. According to a report by the International Federation of Robotics, the industrial robot market is expected to grow by 9 percent annually between 2019 and 2027, with the global market size reaching $30 billion in 2027. This growth is expected to have a significant impact on the global economy, as companies continue to adopt robotics technology and drive innovation.

In conclusion, robotics has a rich history in industry, and its impact on the global economy has been significant. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovation and growth in the robotics industry.

It's impressive how much robotics technology has advanced over time. What are some of the latest developments in the industry?

1983,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," Pro-freedom scholar Thomas Woods, author of 1913: 50 Excluded from History, teaches us that it is not a set of facts, but an organized body of thought that people have and give significance to. And it evolves, subject to those thoughts, as individuals find new techniques for subordinating people to their will.
The fact is that we are still in the period Woods calls ""the subjugation of history."" Due to a general understanding of economics, this is a period where nobody thinks they're getting richer but everyone's increasingly confident that their children will be richer than they are. Furthermore, modern families are subject to not only a general adjustment of perceived wealth from one generation to the next, but also a frequent distortion in the working of market signals because of government-wrought factors such as inflation.
These are often subjects that economics could educate us about, but they do not; rather, economics becomes a stick to beat those of us who have jobs for more control over our employees and communities. Thus, we do not have a science of economics and of how it deals with a government but of anarchy. Indeed, economics as it is today is more a political tool in today's Russia than in any free country, again subject to the survival of the most efficient methods of enslavement.
As an example, while we may understand what an entrance fee into a monopolistic government-run pool could be, we know nothing about the cost savings of free markets. Hence, economists as a class are on the forefront in the empire's ongoing program of mind-battering to have us demoralized and accepting of continued subjugation. This is an ongoing form of slavery, but it is never considered slavery. Nor will the individual of conscience dare mention it.

The associated consumer’s reaction function when money and credit are endogenous is explained by means of general equilibrium models.
In economic growth theory, it is generally accepted that capital and labor contribute to economic growth when they are fixed endowments for the whole of society. The quantitative contribution by investment and savings of each individual, however, depends on the (aggregate) labor supply available to the sector. In this paper, this assumption is lifted by endogenizing labor and not only capital and savings in such a way that the unappealing assumption of mass independence in the Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation is relinquished in the formulation of economic growth theory. The old data of Keeler and Loury are used to calibrate the new model and recompute the rate of interest for all the data countries. The resulting policy implications are analyzed, such as the monetary and fiscal policies for the 21st century.
Economic growth and capital accumulation as well as household consumption are studied by revising the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The response function of each individual is supposed to be a function of (1) the wages, which depend on total capital and (2) taxes, which depend on the net worth of the rich. A menu of available monetary and fiscal policies and instruments is then described. The convergence criterion in which our model is interested is the degree of competition between individuals. An analysis of the political implications of our results shows that throughout history the incentive of people in developing countries to work for the government and to favor less developed countries is often offset by those in rich countries. As long as corruption cannot be eradicated and as long as we assume that the masses never have been willing to compete with the rich, the interest of the poor is clearly in favor of the anti-grasshoppers policies of the French Republic.",415,4,2188

Consider the impact of different forms of technology on the exploration process and explore the ethical and environmental implications of space exploration. Finally, make sure your story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, and that it maintains a consistent tone and narrative style throughout.

She had been training for this mission for years, and now that the moment was finally here, she was filled with a mix of excitement and trepidation.

As they approached the planet, Dr. Hernandez's eyes widened in awe. The terrain was like nothing she had ever seen before - jagged mountains towering over vast, sprawling deserts, interspersed with rivers and waterfalls that shimmered in the light of the sun. The sky was a deep shade of blue, with wispy white clouds floating lazily overhead.

The crew made their way towards the heart of the planet, descending through the thick atmosphere until they finally reached the planet's surface. Dr. Hernandez felt a thrill run through her as she stepped out of the spacecraft, her boots crunching on the hot, sandy ground.

As they explored the planet, they discovered hidden pockets of lush vegetation, with tall trees and colorful flowers creating a stark contrast to the rocky terrain. They also found evidence of ancient ruins, including sprawling cities and structures that were unlike anything they had ever seen before.

1986,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B," and its impact on data science and artificial intelligence. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, I'll have to break down this question into multiple parts. 

1. The History of Machine Learning:
- The term ""machine learning"" was first used in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.
- Machine learning didn't really start gaining traction until the late 1990s. There were a few advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) that encouraged technology companies to invest more in machine learning.
- Over the last decade, the field has seen explosive growth due to advancements in computing power and the increasing availability of large, complex datasets.

2. Impact of Machine Learning on Data Science:
- Machine learning has greatly impacted the field of data science. It has become an integral part of several data science projects.
- In the past, data scientists had to rely on statistical analysis to make predictions or identify patterns in data. This process could be time-consuming and sometimes inaccurate. Machine learning algorithms can quickly go through large amounts of data and identify patterns that might not be immediately obvious to humans.
- With machine learning, data scientists can build predictive models that can be used for tasks such as customer segmentation, fraud detection, and demand forecasting.
- Machine learning has also enabled the development of more sophisticated data visualizations and data storytelling techniques. These techniques allow data scientists to communicate insights and discoveries more effectively to stakeholders.

3. Impact of Machine Learning on Artificial Intelligence:
- Machine learning is a key component of artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a broad field that encompasses multiple approaches to creating machines that can work and think like humans, while machine learning is a specific subset of AI.
- In the past, many AI applications were rule-based, meaning they relied on human programmers to define a set of rules for a system to follow. Machine learning has enabled more sophisticated AI applications, as computers can now learn and improve from experience.
- Today, AI is used in a wide range of applications, including virtual assistants, image and speech recognition, and even self-driving cars.

In conclusion, machine learning has had a profound impact on data science and artificial intelligence. Its ability to quickly process large amounts of data and identify patterns has revolutionized the way we approach data analysis and problem-solving. As the field continues to evolve, we can expect machine learning to play an increasingly important role in the development of AI.",482,4,2645

1988,Qwen_Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B,", along with our broader understanding of human psychology and mental health, has brought about some much needed changes to the way mental health conditions are identified, monitored and treated. A new kind of care that relies on science to show why people experience the conditions they do is now prevalent in healthcare systems around the world, offering individuals the option of a personalized treatment path to get better.
This kind of care is not something new, it was actually a common practice in the past, especially in Native American societies. As William Felix writes in Native American Medicine: The Art of Vitality, “A personal oral consultation was considered most effective. The principle was that the patient was consulted about his ailments; herbs were administered that corresponded with the nature of the illness; and the recovered illness was channeled into a healing ritual.” How did we lose that understanding in the West?
Apparently, that way of healing took a hard hit in the 16th century with the enforcement of mercantilism and imperialistic practices. Native American communities were displaced, and it became illegal to practice their healing traditions, sending a message to anyone thinking of acting in unison with their instinct that the consequences for challenging authority were grave. It was a cruel, dark period in time that was only more difficult for those with conditions that, at the time, were considered incurable: Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder and Insomnia are just a few examples.
Worse still, medical practitioners were not readily equipped with the knowledge needed to understand the above conditions, treating the symptoms rather than addressing the cause. In 1796, insomnia became the most common condition treated by British doctors, and a cursory look at today’s medical landscape reveals that many of the same methods are still in use, such as drug therapy and sleep patterns. Additionally, patients received little to no social support to help them cope with the condition as a whole, something that is of paramount importance for recovery.
The following is a brief look at how changing attitudes and understanding of mental health over the last 100 years have contributed to and in some cases caused the rise in mental health care and pharmaceuticals.
The Second World War, and specifically the murder of six million Jewish people, at the hands of Hitler and the Nazi party, opened the door to everyone to realize mental health was a problem that needed to be addressed.
This helped to quell the fear mongering media by changing “mentally insane” with “personality disturbances” and helping to drive the delineation between mental health and mental illness",503,4,2712

Eventually it became a way of self expression and a way to communicate ideas. Here is some advice to get you going if you are ready for poetry, or want to increase your own poem writing skills.
Writing poetry, or any kind of composition requires perspective. This means you have to know what is going on around you at all times in your life, the places you have been and are going, the people you meet, the events that occur, etc. To write a poem, you need to be open to the world around you and let ideas come to you. Don’t worry about writing something brilliant, the more poetry you write, the better you get. Write like you would speak, let it flow, don’t analyze too much right away, just let it happen.
More than ever you need to have a goal or theme for your poem. What are you trying to say? This is important so you don’t end up with non-sequitors or other random thoughts throughout your poem. Aim your poem for a particular topic, event, person, or whatever you want to say. For example, I just wrote a poem about my relationship with my mother, I was able to flesh out certain aspects and communicate them through my poetry. Write and write and write until you are satisfied with the poem you have.
After you have written your poem don’t leave it alone, work it over again to perfect it. This doesn’t mean you should change the meaning or completely rewrite the whole thing, it’s just fine tuning. Make the words flow better, fix grammar problems, etc. I do a final read through before I show anyone to make sure my meaning is clear, all the syntax is correct, etc.
That is about all there is to writing poetry, if you follow these steps you should be well on your way. The important thing to remember is to have fun with it, allow yourself to be creative and look at things from a different perspective. Like I said before, to start you should write to write and get better as you go. Poetry can also be a very effective means of communication, find a topic or emotion you wish to express and write about it. Don’t expect it to be successful the first time, everyone starts somewhere, keep on writing.",491,4,2238

## An ant's perspective on the world

There are many different ways that one can learn about physics, ranging from

• self-instructional learning, such as reading introductory university textbooks on physics,
• taking introductory physics classes at your local community college, or
• learning about physics from older students who may not have the background to teach.

In many cases, these different forms of instruction will teach the same physics and end up in the same place, but may use different conceptual (intuitive) and mathematical tools. Further, it is not always the case that these different paths lead to the same understanding. Often, even if the physics presented is equivalent, the approaches may not lead to identical knowledge, and some students may even think the physics presented is equivalent but have had a different understanding. In the end, it is the students and not their teachers that must determine what is equivalent.

Today's activity illustrates an example of this phenomenon in which two students, both of whom are told about the same phenomena and told about the same experiments, but who use different approaches, end up having very different understandings of it.

• George students at the University of San Diego has developed a high-tech parking meter for his bicycle. He tells us about it here. One of the lessons he learned was that understanding the physics of bicycles and the way wheels rotate is crucial in this process. Watch the video and learn more about George's parking meter.

• Jacob loves bikes, and builds bicycle-powered crazy contraptions like the one in the picture to the right. He's been working on his bike-powered generator lately and talks about the basics of how it all works. You can read more about his generator on the right.

Many veg, herbs and flowers had moved into pots on the deck and onto lawn, which I didn’t water every day, and then one day my daughter came home and mowed the lawn and got watered up pots!
Imagine my disappointment to see this:
D’oh! Yes, I did spray the vinegar on the tea-bags to help them stick to the pots. But these pots and herbs weren’t quick-drying, and also I had treated the tomato pots with a copper spray last year and I didn’t think vinegar would be compatible.
Thankfully, I did have a good big top up of seaweed and fish fertilizer to help the garden to bounce back.
You can see the pots have recovered, but what I wonder is, would they have survived this without a daily watering regime on the lawn? Does a day of dryness knock back the garden or not?

BioArte might not produce anything as lovely as miniature faerie worlds, but it could certainly cut down on some of the waste caused by other art-people while looking pretty durn cute in the process. Each creation has its own little label with the beer, along with its ingredients list. If you buy any of them, you might be one of the lucky few who find a very 2012 thrift item: Those mini bottles of BEER SKIN LIPS, which they used for decorative purposes only.",230,4,1092

Machine Learning in Cutting Tool Design

Cutting tools play a crucial role in the manufacturing process, and their performance has a significant impact on the final product quality. However, designing and manufacturing high-performance cutting tools is a complex and challenging task due to various constraints and uncertainties. Machine learning techniques offer an attractive alternative to traditional methods for cutting tool design, and they are gaining increasing attention in the cutting tool industry. In this article, we will explore some of the latest machine learning techniques used in cutting tool design.

Machine Learning Techniques for Cutting Tool Design

Machine learning techniques have many applications in cutting tool design, including cutting tool geometry optimization, cutting tool performance prediction, and cutting tool failure diagnosis. Here, we will briefly discuss some of the latest machine learning techniques used in cutting tool design.

Convolutional Neural Networks for Cutting Tool Geometry Optimization

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of neural networks that are commonly used for image recognition tasks. However, they have also shown promising results in other applications, such as feature extraction and pattern recognition. In cutting tool design, CNNs can be used to optimize the geometry of a cutting tool based on design variables such as cutting edge radius, rake angle, and chip thickness.

CNNs are trained using a dataset of cutting tool geometry and performance data. The training process involves two stages: feature extraction and classification. During feature extraction, the CNN learns to extract relevant features from the cutting tool geometry data. During classification, the CNN learns to classify the cutting tool geometry data into different categories based on their performance characteristics. The performance characteristics of a cutting tool include cutting force, cutting temperature, and cutting power.

Once the CNN is trained, it can be used to optimize the cutting tool geometry based on different design variables. The optimization process involves finding the design variables that maximize the performance of the cutting tool. The CNN-based optimization process can significantly reduce the computational effort required to design high-performance cutting tools.

Support Vector Machines for Cutting Tool Performance Prediction

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a popular machine learning technique used for pattern recognition and classification tasks. In cutting tool design, SVMs can be used to predict the performance characteristics of a cutting tool based on its geometry and material properties.

SVMs are trained using a dataset of cutting tool performance data and cutting tool geometry data. The training process involves finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into different categories based on their performance characteristics. Once the SVM is trained, it can be used to predict the performance",520,4,3083

# All poetry is emergent

I’ve often heard it said that all poetry is emergent. As in the sentence

There is no such thing as poetry; all writing is emergent.

But that is wrong. We can see it when it comes to using the English language to write. Reading a newspaper or other written text is far more difficult that listening to somebody talk.

This might come as a surprise to many, but that difficulty is due to the emergence of sentence structure. As Dan Sperber and Shaun Nichols put it:

There is no such thing as language; all communication is communication through [pragmatics] and [literary texts] are not language use; they are literature use. Poetry is not language; all poetry is literature.

“Communication through pragmatics” means that words (and their meanings) can depend on an embedded context, which often not what a reader or writer would normally expect. “Literature” is the single word we use to describe all creative writing, including poetry, short stories, novels, plays, and any other creative writing form.

If all writing is literature, then there is no poetry.

I’ll come to that in a minute.

But first I’d like to put a question to you. Look at the sentence:

“You sure got that fiver?”

Can you imagine anybody repeating the order that we can read in this question?

“You sure got that fiver, sure?”

(If so, please tell me in the comments.)

My hypothesis is that all reading depends on the ability of the reader to create embedded questions in their mind. This happens far too frequently for any reader to consciously notice; it’s more like something you do without thinking.

I think people do this all the time when reading, but with embedded questions, in the following sentence:

The report said that things were not so bad and that there was hope for the future.

I remember hearing about this one for the first time. A friend of mine was having a deep philosophical discussion with a priest. “Do you believe in heaven and hell?” my friend asked, and received the answer, “Yes, I do, but I don’t believe in earth and god!”

We normally don’t even notice that we create questions like that.

This got me thinking about the question whether or not all poetry is also literature.

I don’t think I can prove that all literature is poetry, but here are my arguments in favour of this point of view:

• when it comes to writing, the meaning of words, phrasing",522,4,2393

The relationship between neuroscience and technology is becoming increasingly important. Neuroscientists are already making significant advances that will have an impact on our lives, as technology develops and as we gain more and more control over how we work and play.
The inspiration for VAIN was born from a need for a new space to foster creativity in everyday lives. I wanted to find new ways to explore and create visual representations of neurophysiological information through art and design. I was interested in exploring the relationship between brain and machines through the aesthetic sense, in a point that stimulates curiosity and desire for more. In VAIN creative scientists and design enthusiasts come together to brainstorm about how to conceive, inform and present how human mind and its functions are happening in a plain day.
Aesthetics is a series of 12 10”×10” monotypes created with refined chemical etchings of 180 million-year-old rocks found in Dinosaur Provincial Park, Canada. Through the investigation of psyche and vision, Pejic realigns artistic and scientific concepts and plays in both arts and sciences. The sun appears as a simple splash of color in the midst of natural beauty to the masses, a metaphorical reflection of the voids and contradictions within human beings. Aesthetics presents an aspect of our world which has been here long before we were here, yet it can not be reversed and mirrored to be with us forever. It is a path to rapture of freedom of contemplation.
Artist Statement: Featuring paintings exploring light and human mind. A visual representation of emotional experience induced by the cycles of sun and moon as well as seasons. Created during the experimental nocturnal sessions involving visual meditation by luminous lines and complex shapes of light created by reflective surfaces. Surreal motives are created by treating moments that absorb and expand optical experience in projection of light against surface forms and by visual journey with all senses.
The unexpected forms of light evoked by cycles of natural phenomena have attracted us since we first saw our environment and developed a vision to interpret our surroundings. Paintings use natural phenomena of daily sunrises and sunsets, sun orbiting inside the gigantic celestial body as well as light reflected in milky water surfaces with which close and distant forms interact. I am intrigued by the blurred forms of daylight and by the fact that moon actually does orbit the planet and can be seen when the sun is out. This sort of experience is unknown and inexistent from human perspective, on a different scale. Unfortunately we are unable to see our",505,4,2715

the travel requirements of people. There are many reasons why people travel, and these reasons are related to all kinds of vacation plans. Family vacation is a popular reason for travel, as well as business travel, travel, adventurous travel and last minute trips.
There are many specific reasons why people choose to vacation with their families, including children, parents and grandparents, and all family members enjoy travel time. As a family vacation, be sure to take the kids with enough luggage and a variety of fun entertainment, such as DVD players, books, games, and a number of other interesting things. All family members should have adequate gear for cold weather. Look for suitable hotel arrangements, including a family-friendly hotel and hotel with activity programs. A vacation with the family is the best opportunity to be together, because these are the golden years that may never see each other again.
To create a perfect destination for those wishing to relieve stress, you need to think of a memorable and memorable trip. With the exception of very high-cost vacations, your complete travels and holidays should be private and belong only to you. Do not stay with children or other people you do not like during your travels, because the goal of your private travel should be to find peace of mind. If you have the resources, you can even choose an exotic vacation, such as diving in the Philippines or the Hawaiian Islands. Finally, a good vacation to forget your worries and enjoy it.
The new millennium has brought many technological advances to the surface. The introduction of laptop computers and mobile phones has changed the face of travel to some extent. However, both are limited in that most limited luggage or everyday use in a limited number of chairs is not possible for short journeys. So for many, the best travel option is still to buy products that include everything you need. When you decide to try, make sure your purchases are with you, durable, practical, easy to use, etc. So you can use these products for longer periods, making your travels and travel more rewarding.
PDA, laptop, camera, thermometer, knife, LED torch, umbrella, games, etc. are all the items that fit well. They also save you valuable space. If you have chosen a small suitcase, you will not be able to carry a bulky or heavy laptop.
Finally, you have reached the age of travel and you are going to overcome the obstacle. You should not be afraid of traveling as an old person. Remember, when traveling or traveling, you must be smart and stay with a guard who will protect you.",517,4,2597
